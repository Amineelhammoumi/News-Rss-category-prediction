		<text>By Becky Noble March 22, 2022 at 5:03pmAs the Biden administration faces the wild swings of rising gas and food prices, general inflation, conflict abroad, and poor poll numbers for both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, a new book due out in May claims to shed light on some of trouble brewing behind the scenes.The book, “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future,” is coauthored by two New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns.🚨@playbookdc has a peek from our book at the tensions between the @VP   WH @alexburnsNYT and I report on the VP’s frustration w Biden’s lack of clarity on filibuster + the West Wing’s exasperation w VP office drama, which they blame on herMore soonhttps://t.co/7Hys3dRf5X— Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) March 22, 2022RELATED: Cruz Blasts Democrats For Past Filibustering Of Black And Hispanic Judicial NomineesThe book dishes the inside scoop on how Kamala Harris’ team, throughout the first year of Joe Biden’s presidency, was upset about the areas of responsibility she was tasked with.An excerpt reveals that Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield blamed Harris for her own horrendous first year in office – and that it maybe shouldn’t have been a surprise: “In private, Bedingfield had taken to noting that the vice presidency was not the first time in Harris’s political career that she had fallen short of sky-high expectations: Her Senate office had been messy and her presidential campaign had been a fiasco. Perhaps, she suggested, the problem was not the vice president’s staff.”Bedingfield gave a non-denial denial of the claim in a response to Politico, saying: “The fact that no one working on this book bothered to call to fact check this unattributed claim tells you what you need to know. Vice President Harris is a force in this administration and I have the utmost respect for the work she does every day to move the country forward.”Another bit in the book reveals that Harris and Biden’s weekly lunches “lacked a real depth of personal and political intimacy.”Finally a voice of reason. Joe listen to you wife from now on. https://t.co/uYTZ86lpIb— Antar 🇮🇪 🇵🇸 🇨🇺 🇾🇪 (@MarkGolden16) March 22, 2022RELATED: Mama Grizzly Comeback? Sarah Palin Says She May Run For Open Seat In CongressThe new book also gives details about how First Lady Jill Biden was less than happy with the VP pick of Kamala Harris. An excerpt from the book states,“Speaking in confidence with a close adviser to her husband’s campaign, the future first lady posed a pointed question. There are millions of people in the United States, she began. Why, she asked, do we have to choose the one who attacked Joe?”The First Lady, already no fan of Kamala Harris, was referencing a presidential debate where then-candidate Harris attacked candidate Biden for racist busing views in the past. In the debate, Harris said, “It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States Senators who built their reputations and careers on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose bussing. Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose bussing in America?”of course he did…Biden warned staff after Kamala Harris  disastrous Guatemala trip that anyone leaking negative stories would be fired. https://t.co/YqZ72TtSc1— hmm… (@michaelallenmar) March 22, 2022RELATED: Trump Spikes The Football After Winning Court Case, Stormy Daniels Is Ordered To Pay His Legal Fees The turnover rate among Kamala Harris’ staff seems to be unusually high, even for high pressure White House jobs. The latest in a long line of staffers to go is deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh, to take a position at the Defense Department.The problem is not a new one. Back in December, as many as four staff members in Harris’ office announced they were leaving at the same time. This followed a CNN report on troubles then in the VP’s office.The atmosphere in Harris’ office was described as “tense” and “dour.” Some staff described situations where ideas might be brought up but were either dismissed or ignored. Many said that Harris does not take responsibility for important issues and blames staff when problems arise.KAMALA HARRIS:  The significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time.

		<text>By Becky Noble March 22, 2022 at 4:39pmFew conservative entertainers will voice their views in public. Making a living in an uber-liberal environment like the entertainment industry, and declaring support for Republicans or even more shocking, Donald Trump, is rare in the extreme.Then there’s musician Kid Rock. He’s unabashedly conservative, a staunch Trump supporter, and he doesn’t care who knows it. His millions of fans know his views, and they are ok with it too.On Monday night, Kid Rock sat down with Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson to talk about chatting with Trump about foreign policy, golf, and other topics facing the nation.I never realized I was such a Kid Rock fan until I watched him tonight on Tucker Carlson. Gotta love a real man who speaks his mind and isn’t afraid of being canceled. In fact, he says he’s “uncancelable”and loves it when they try. A true patriot. #KidRock #TuckerCarlson— Alana Stewart (@AlanaKStewart) March 22, 2022RELATED: Video: Trump Says Putin Constantly Used The ‘N-Word’ – To Describe Nuclear Threats The interview ranged a whole host of topics with the affable Kid Rock.Tucker Carson asked Rock about his relationship with the former president, “You are still playing golf with them down in Florida?” He also asked how Trump was doing, “How’s he seemed?”“He seems great! He seems great. You know, after the election it was, you know a little different there, but he’s still the same guy. He sits down and just cuts it up. You start cutting it up, how sharp he is, it’s incredible.”The contrast between Trump and Biden is stark, Kid Rock says. “See now, if you watch a Joe Biden interview, and you watch a Trump interview, there’s no comparison. And Trump speaks off the cuff.“I understand what it’s like, sometimes you get it wrong. But I would way rather hear somebody come from here [the heart] and get it wrong once in a while.”Perhaps one of the most memorable moments in the interview with Tucker Carlson has Kid Rock telling of how he helped – or didn’t – Trump with messaging on the terrorist group ISIS.“I was there with him one day at the end of the caliphate. He wanted to put out a tweet, and it was like … I don’t like to speak out of school and I hope I’m not, but it was something like, he was like, the tweet was and I’m paraphrasing, ‘If you ever joined a caliphate and tried to do this, you’re gonna be dead.”When Trump asked his opinion of the tweet, Rock gave him a thumbs up sign and said, “Awesome! Tweet that out! I can’t add anything better than that!” He did say that Trump did clean it up a bit, making it more “politically correct” before posting it.Kid Rock told Tucker that he and Trump were looking at maps, with Kid Rock wonder if that’s something he should be doing, when Trump ask him, “‘What do you think we should do about North Korea?’ I’m like ‘What? I don’t think I’m qualified to answer this! ”BREAKING REPORT: Kid Rock discusses how his conservative views are PERCEIVED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY on  Tucker  – Tells critics to  go f—  themselves…— Chuck Callesto (@ChuckCallesto) March 22, 2022RELATED: Candace Owens Brilliantly Turns The Tables After NYT Claims She’s Shilling For Putin By Criticizing Ukrainian CorruptionKid Rock was a Trump supporter from the beginning of the 2016 campaign. In an interview with Rolling Stone that year, when asked what he thought about the field of candidates, Kid Rock may have been ahead of his time, and described what many are feeling now about elected officials.“I’m digging Trump. I feel like a lot of people, whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican, feel like if you get Hillary or Bernie, or you get Rubio or Cruz or whoever, there’s going to be the same sh*t.” He added, “My feeling: let the m***erf**king business guy run it (the country) like a f**king business.” We re looking at maps and sh*t, and I m like,  Am I supposed to be in on this shit?  the rocker told Tucker Carlson. https://t.co/DFnhNonaGx— Yahoo News (@YahooNews) March 22, 2022RELATED: Republican Alabama Senate Hopeful Mo Brooks Wants To ‘Fire Mitch McConnell’Tucker Carlson also asked about Kid Rock’s latest album “Bad Reputation.” Carlson asked, “So if there was a message behind the album, what would it be?” Without hesitation, Rock answered, “To my fans, I love you dearly. To [the] critics, haters and trolls – go f— yourself.”He added,“I love the trolls and the haters and the critics who’ve been trying to, you know, knock me down for 20, 30 years. And I just, I’m still standing, [and] still operate at the highest levels.”Carlson asked, “So why haven’t you been canceled?” Kid Rock gave the answer more artists should be giving:“I’m uncancelable, because I don’t give a f—. I’m not in bed with any big corporate things. At the end of the day, there’s nobody I’m beholden to. No record companies, no corporate interests, no nothing. And you can’t cancel me.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 22, 2022 at 12:21pmDonald Trump issued a statement celebrating a court upholding an order for porn star Stormy Daniels to pay him nearly $300,000 in legal fees due to her failed defamation lawsuit.The ruling marks a likely end to the years-long legal battle between Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Gregory Clifford, and the former President.The declaration comes from a federal appeals court rejecting her bid to overturn a lower court decision in her defamation lawsuit against Trump.In their decision late last week, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said it had no jurisdiction over Daniels’ appeal of the attorneys’ fees issue because she did not file a notice within the proper timeframe, according to CNBC.PORN SPAR: Stormy Daniels Loses Appeal, Must Pay Trump 300K in Attorney Fees —Both Parties Respond https://t.co/d5Px0P7LKz— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 22, 2022A federal judge in 2018 tossed out Daniels’ lawsuit against President Trump, citing First Amendment rights, and ordered her to pay the legal fees.Daniels had sued the President in April of 2018 regarding a tweet in which he denied her claims of being threatened by a man in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011.The adult actress claimed a man had warned her about going public with an alleged affair with Trump. She later provided a police sketch of a man many viewed as a dead ringer for her ex-husband.Trump mocked her story as a “total con job,” prompting the lawsuit.BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!Porn star Stormy Daniels loses appeal in Trump case, owes former president almost $300,000 https://t.co/sTRrCAYSAu— Pradheep J.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 22, 2022 at 11:43amFormer Attorney General Bill Barr says he was “shocked” and “disturbed” that Joe Biden lied to the American people about his son Hunter’s infamous laptop being ‘Russian disinformation.’In an interview with Fox News reporter John Roberts, the AG under Trump was confronted by comments he made regarding the many scandals that erupted from the Hunter Biden laptop.The New York Times recently admitted the laptop and its contents were real in a story on Hunter’s tax bill and the federal investigation into his business dealings.The Times discussed having “obtained” and “authenticated” emails from “files that appear to have come from a laptop abandoned by [Hunter] Biden.”Barr ripped Joe Biden for, during a presidential debate, lying to the American people when he dismissed his son’s laptop as ‘Russian disinformation.’🚨BILL BARR:“Joe Biden knew the laptop was real. I was disturbed that Joe Biden would stand up and lie to the American people when confronted about it in the debates. The Intelligence letter was a baseless. Joe Biden knew it was a lie. This is INTERFERENCE in the election” pic.twitter.com/doOFbOaJtd— Benny (@bennyjohnson) March 21, 2022RELATED: NY Post Slams Intel Officials Who Claimed Hunter’s Laptop Was ‘Russian Disinformation’: Desperate To Get Biden ElectedBarr has been walking a tightrope of trying to appease those who view him as a formidable figure and trying to appear “reasonable” in contrast with former President Donald Trump.Nowhere is this more evident than in what Barr is saying now about the Hunter Biden laptop story and what he allegedly told President Trump at the time, according to excerpts from his new book.“I was very disturbed during the debate when candidate Biden lied to the American people about the laptop,” Barr told Roberts.“He [was] squarely confronted with the laptop and suggested it was Russian disinformation and pointed to the letter written by intelligence people, it was baseless, which he knew was a lie, and I was shocked by that,” Barr continued.He even went so far as to suggest the Biden campaign and the media had colluded to ‘interfere’ in the election.“Fortunately the DNI came out and said no it’s not (Russian disinformation), and FBI said the same thing, media ignored it. So when you are talking about interference in an election, can’t think of anything more…” he added.Bill Barr failed to do the right thing as AG.He sat on the Hunter Biden laptop and he did nothing about the 2020 election. Go away, hack. https://t.co/xreUKIkQaD— Alex Bruesewitz (@alexbruesewitz) March 22, 2022RELATED: Joe Rogan Hammers Media For Covering Up Hunter Biden Story: ‘They Ignore Facts To Push A Narrative’As for keeping up the ‘tough against Trump’ persona, Bill Barr’s commentary on the Hunter Biden laptop scandal was far more muted when the former President asked him about it.“You know this stuff from Hunter Biden’s laptop?” Trump asked Barr, according to his book, “One Damn Thing After Another.”“Mr. President, I can’t talk about that, and I am not going to,” Barr replied.“You know, if that was one of my kids,” Trump again pressed before being cut off.“Dammit, Mr. President, I am not going to talk to you about Hunter Biden. Period!” Barr fired back in a raised voice.‘If only Trump had said, “You’re Fired.”– Diana West (Gab)Barr recalls yelling at Trump over Hunter Biden in last conversation before 2020 electionhttps://t.co/OVydgUcFwT— Anita Miller ❌ AUDIT ALL 50 STATES (@FoxNewsMom) March 2, 2022In his book, Barr did note that Biden’s claims that the laptop story was ‘Russian disinformation’ amounted to a “bogus statement” and “deception” on the part of his campaign and the media.Still, Fox News reports that “Trump was upset with [Barr] for not refuting a claim now-President Biden made about emails on the laptop possibly being part of a Russian disinformation campaign.”If Bill Bar was so disturbed by what was on Hunter Biden’s laptop- then why didn’t he do anything about it when he was in office?https://t.co/4tCEuARkBf— NYChick (@Tough_N_Tender) March 22, 2022Biden repeated the ‘Russian disinformation’ canard well after the election.“Mr. President-elect, do you still think that the stories from the fall about your son Hunter were Russian disinformation and a smear campaign like you said?” Fox News reporter Peter Doocy asked at a press conference in late December.Biden replied, “Yes, yes, yes.”Joe Biden laughs when Fox News’ Peter Doocy asks if he still thinks the allegations against Hunter Biden are Russian disinformation:“Yes, yes, yes. God love you, man. You’re a one horse pony.” pic.twitter.com/x8HEvPjpFn— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) December 22, 2020When asked about the revelation that the Hunter Biden laptop is real, White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who also felt compelled to comment on it being ‘Russian disinformation,’ suddenly couldn’t remark on the matter.“I’d point to the Department of Justice and Hunter Biden’s representatives,” she said when asked for comment. “I’m a spokesperson for the United States; he doesn’t work for the United States.”Psaki is asked if she stands by calling the Hunter Biden laptop Russian disinfo:“I’d point you to the DOJ and Hunter Biden’s representatives. I’m a spokesperson for the United States. He doesn’t work for the United States.” pic.twitter.com/ONq0TPyF1i— Greg Price (@greg_price11) March 17, 2022If Bill Barr was so shocked and disturbed by the lies being told by Biden and the media back in October of 2020, why didn’t he say anything?Several Republican lawmakers and aides to President Trump at the time called on him to investigate the Hunter Biden laptop.“Let’s get to the facts, let’s figure out exactly how much Joe Biden knew about this,” Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH) told Fox News at the time as he called for a special counsel investigation into the business dealings revealed by the discovery of the device.The Justice Department, according to a Daily Mail report, had a “policy against taking actions that would interfere in an election.”Based on Barr’s comments in the present, they would have actually been taking action to prevent interference in the election.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comRusty Weiss is a freelance writer focusing on the conservative movement and its political agenda.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 22, 2022 at 11:15amFormer Alaska governor Sarah Palin said if she were asked to run for Congress she would do it “in a heartbeat.”Palin, the Republican vice-presidential candidate in 2008, made the comments in an interview with Newsmax’ Eric Bolling.The two were speaking about the pathway forward following news of the death of late Alaska Republican Representative Don Young on Friday at the age of 88.“Oh my goodness, think of those huge shoes that are to be filled when we consider Don Young’s longevity and his passion, his love, his fighting spirit for our wonderful state of Alaska, and for the nation as a whole,” Palin said.She then commented on the possibility of her being the one to fill those snowshoes.Rumor has it Sarah Palin is considering a run for Congress to replace Don Young.I hope she runs.

She Says ‘If God Wants Me To’ She’ll Challenge Murkowski For Alaska Senate SeatSarah Palin also expressed interest in running for Congress – though for a Senate seat – last year.She told a conservative Christian group that she’d consider running for a Senate seat in Alaska “if God wants me to.”Palin noted at the time that if she were to run, she’d need the backing of the Republican Party, unlike the way they treated her as the late Senator John McCain’s running mate in 2008.Palin feels the McCain campaign and the GOP, in general, left her to flail in the wind in the midst of cruel personal attacks from the Obama campaign and the media.“Some people, certainly not in the White House, are aware of what petroleum products actually are.”@SarahPalinUSA blasts Biden’s “policies shutting down our own development of the God-given resources we have, untapped, in America.”MORE: https://t.co/MjbX4zPA48 pic.twitter.com/QzoPeZydK7— Newsmax (@newsmax) March 21, 2022“If God wants me to do it I will,” Palin said when asked if she’d run for a Senate seat in 2021.“What I would do if I were to announce is say you know what, you guys better be there for me this time because a lot of people weren’t there for me last time and that’s why characterization-wise, I got clobbered,” she explained at the time.I don’t care what anyone says, I will always have a soft spot for Sarah Palin.Her early Nikki Haley endorsement alone makes her a national treasure in my eyes. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/NKkI1HlfDW— ℝ𝕖𝕒𝕘𝕒𝕟𝕚𝕥𝕖 🇺🇸🇺🇦🐘 (@emperoreagan) March 19, 2022Bolling, in their latest interview, seemed to take joy from the prospect of seeing Palin participate in congressional panels and inquiries and asked if she was up for the job.“Well, you know, when you have nothing to lose,” she replied.POLL: Should Sarah Palin run for Congress?“When the media has already clobbered you, as bad as you can get clobbered, and the haters, you’re not going to change their mind,” added Palin.“But you have faith that there are enough Americans who understand where you’re coming from, your love for the country, your service heart.”A Sarah Palin versus the Squad showdown in Congress would certainly make for interesting viewing.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comRusty Weiss is a freelance writer focusing on the conservative movement and its political agenda.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 22, 2022 at 11:06amConservative commentator Candace Owens got the better of the New York Times after the paper made insinuations about Owens parroting Russian propaganda. Owens had come under fire for making the obvious observation that Ukraine is rife with corruption, which an NYT reporter claimed “matched” comments from Russian state media.Owens posted an email she received from a reporter asking her for a statement.“We’re working on a story about Russian messaging that includes some of your comments,” it reads. “We note that you advanced the idea that Ukraine was a corrupt country, which matched comments we’ve seen from Russian state media.”Owens fired back by pointing out she didn’t get her ideas from Russian state media, but rather … the New York Times’ extensive coverage of Ukrainian corruption.Received an email from The NYTimes asking for comment regarding me “advancing ideas that Ukraine is a corrupt country”—similar to Russian state TV.I replied informing them that I actually got my ideas from the New York Times, and provided them links to their past articles. 😂 pic.twitter.com/Zy6a7Btih4— Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) March 21, 2022RELATED: Ukraine Suspends Opposition Political Parties, Zelensky Nationalizes All Privately-Owned Media CompaniesCandace Owens posted screenshots of her interaction with the New York Times regarding allegations that she is parroting Russian state media by commenting on corruption in Ukraine.OK, that’s pretty funny. https://t.co/JcVTUxmnC2— Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) March 21, 2022“I am very confused by this email,” Owens writes in response. “I learned about ‘the idea that Ukraine was a corrupt country’ from the New York Times.”She provided several links on the topic, including at least three from the Times itself.“You guys have covered the corruption of Ukraine extensively, for years” she added.The initial link she passed along directs one to a New York Times editorial board column titled, “Ukraine’s Unyielding Corruption,” published in 2016.In it, the board points out “Ukraine’s deeply ingrained culture of corruption” that is “(un)likely to change.”This entertainment is free! 🤣— CentreRightBrit (@BritRight) March 21, 2022Corruption in Ukraine has, of course, been heavily covered for years. The Guardian noted as much in 2015 with the blaring headline, “Welcome to Ukraine, the most corrupt nation in Europe.”The think tank Carnegie Europe noted in 2016, “Corruption” is an inadequate word to describe the condition of Ukraine.”The New York Times reported just three days before the Russian invasion, “…no progress has been made in fighting corruption.”It’s hard to believe, but all of the West’s most prestigious outlets and institutions have been stooges for Putin all along!RELATED: Bloomberg Lectures Americans On Inflation: Eat Lentils, Take The Bus, And Let Your Pets DieThe Political Insider on Monday reported on how Ukraine, in the midst of the Russian invasion, has suspended opposition political parties and nationalized all media.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree that combines all national TV channels into one platform, citing the importance of a “unified information policy” under martial law.I have supported President Zelensky’s incredible war effort.But he is wrong to ban 11 opposition parties and all private TV stations.The world is backing Ukraine because it wants to embrace democracy, after all.https://t.co/mE2r8yrkX9— Dan Wootton (@danwootton) March 21, 2022I perused the New York Times Tuesday morning but have yet to see any newly published columns which focus on Candace Owens or her ideas “we’ve seen from” Russian state media the New York Times.It will be interesting to see if the newspaper of record reveals to readers that Owens claims she got her ideas on corruption in Ukraine from their very own pages.I just love how they always do this with the “we’re finalizing the story today” crap. They just got burned, and I am HERE for it.— Pam (@lifebythecreek) March 22, 2022The Times last column on the matter was published on February 25th where Owens is lumped together with several other “right-wing commentators.”The commentators are accused of posting comments “that were favorable to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and that rationalized his actions against Ukraine.”As proof, they excerpt an email from Owens at the time which cast blame on the Russian invasion toward President Joe Biden.“Ukrainians are dying because of the Biden family’s criminal connections and insistence on stoking conflict in the region,” she wrote.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comRusty Weiss is a freelance writer focusing on the conservative movement and its political agenda.

Circuit.”“And they did so precisely because they wanted to prevent Judge Brown from becoming Justice Brown, the first African American woman. Joe Biden was among the Democrats the first African American woman nominated to the D.C. Circuit,” the senator claimed.In 2003, Democrats originally blocked Rogers Brown’s confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying her supposed ideological stances were too “out of the legal mainstream” for the D.C. district court.Brown was re-nominated and confirmed two years later by a 56-43 vote.Her journey to the Supreme Court would end there, after then-Senator Joe Biden threatened on “Face the Nation” that Brown would be filibustered if President George W. Bush nominated her for the Supreme Court.Cruz then cited Democrats’ 2003 filibuster over the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Estrada, a Honduran immigrant, was nominated by Bush.The Washington Times reported at the time, “In one memo to Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois obtained by The Washington Times, Washington lawyer Miguel A. Estrada is singled out as ‘especially dangerous’ because “he has a minimal paper trail, he is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him for a Supreme Court appointment.”Estrada eventually withdrew his nomination after eight months of Democrats using the “Jim Crow filibuster.”.@SenTedCruz:  If you are Hispanic or African American and you dare depart from Democrats  political orthodoxy, they will crush you, they will attack you, they will slander you, they will filibuster you.

		<text>By The Center Square March 22, 2022 at 10:08amBy Casey Harper (The Center Square)Mortgage rates surpassed 4% for the first time since 2019 and the Federal Reserve announced a series of new rate hikes this week, two major shifts that mark the economic response to months of elevated inflation.The Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% interest rate hike and said six more increases are on the way. Last week’s increase is meant to rein in inflation, but can have negative effects on economic growth. Meanwhile, mortgage rates are expected to increase along with the Federal Reserve rate.RELATED: Bloomberg Lectures Americans On Inflation: Eat Lentils, Take The Bus, And Let Your Pets Die“The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong,” the Federal Reserve said in its rate hike announcement. “In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.”The Federal Reserve justified the hike by saying the job market had reached a sufficient level.“Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen,” the Federal Reserve said. “Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.”Those mortgage rates will make it harder for Americans to afford homes, even as house prices soar.“Housing sales slip over 7% in February,” said Elizabeth Kreiselmaier, one of many Republican Congressional candidates running on economic problems, which are expected to help hand Republicans hefty wins in November.Congressional Republicans currently hold a double digit lead on the generic ballot against Democrats.“Mortgage rates are on the rise, as household savings are reduced by inflation, making it more difficult for first time buyers,” Kreiselmaier said. “This is the direct result of failed Biden/Kilmer economic policies.”Critics say the latest federal spending spree of several trillion dollars, led by President Joe Biden, is to blame.“This is the epitome of how big government policies go awry and hurt the little guy,” said Jonathan Williams, the chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council. “The Biden administration’s trillion-dollar spending increases are directly responsible for inflation and thus the rising mortgage interest rates which are making it harder for hard-working Americans to buy a home.“The Federal Reserve raises interest rates in an attempt to bring down the high inflation, which is the product of the federal government’s overspending,” he added. “Anytime Congress essentially prints money it leads to inflation.”RELATED: Conservative Firebrand Dinesh D’Souza Rips Biden Voters – ‘Happy’ About Karma Coming Their WayWilliams said correcting federal spending is the long-term solution.“For everyone who liked their so-called free government money over the past two years, this is the result: inflation, and now, higher interest rates,” he said. “The policy solution is for the federal government to adopt a meaningful balanced budget amendment, just as 49 of our 50 states have already done. If designed correctly, this would prevent the federal government from overspending, which inevitably leads to a disastrous cycle of inflation and high interest rates. We need our policymakers in Washington to look to the states, the laboratories of democracy, for policy solutions that work for everyday Americans.”Syndicated with permission from The Center Square.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comDon t let liberals in media silence conservatives.

		<text>By John Hanson March 22, 2022 at 9:59amOn Monday, Alabama Republican congressman and U.S. Senate candidate Mo Brooks unveiled his campaign effort to “fire” GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.Brooks, who is endorsed by Donald Trump, said in a press release that he wants “other conservatives around the country” to sign the pledge to oust the long-time GOP leader that some conservatives view as too soft and conciliatory with Democrats.In a new campaign ad, Brooks explained why McConnell has to go:RELATED: MSNBC’s Joy Reid Complained That ‘Media’ Wasn’t Covering ‘Non-white’ Wars – That She Ignored CompletelyBrooks said, “Mitch McConnell likes fighting Trump more than he likes fighting Democrats. The entire time President Trump was in office, McConnell repeatedly undermined President Trump, refused to build the Wall, refused to investigate 2020 voter fraud and election theft, and refused to stand up to the Russia Hoax.”“McConnell hates Trump, hates the candidates Trump has endorsed, hates the MAGA agenda, hates principled conservatives, and hates the House Freedom Caucus,” Brooks contended.“This race is not about me,” he continued. “It’s about Donald Trump and the MAGA agenda versus Mitch McConnell and the bought and paid for special interest agenda.”America does not need any more weakling, cowering, wimpy Republican Congressmen and Senators.That’s why President Trump endorses me, and why Mitch McConnell opposes us. pic.twitter.com/iDMLYC93gr— Mo Brooks – Endorsed By President Trump 🇺🇸 (@MoBrooks) March 17, 2022Brooks thinks conservatives must choose.“It is time for conservatives to choose sides,” Brooks said. “In 2017, McConnell spent more than ten million dollars lying about me and my record. Now he’s at it again. This time he’s even more determined because President Trump has endorsed me.”POLL: Should the GOP be more like Trump or McConnell?Brooks claimed that McConnell is unpopular.“Worse yet, according to Real Clear Politics polling data, Mitch McConnell is far and away the most unpopular politician in Washington,” he said. “Republicans must have as one of its leading spokesmen someone who is believable. Mitch McConnell simply does not cut it.”Interesting factoid of the day: Donald Trump has the highest favorable rating of any U.S. political leader. Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell have the lowest. https://t.co/Mw4EGc7xVu pic.twitter.com/uENBsAxGeg— Tom Bevan (@TomBevanRCP) March 18, 2022RELATED: McCarthy Vows To Kick Adam Schiff Off Intel Committee If GOP Wins Back The HouseThe Washington Examiner reported in mid-March that Trump may not be entirely pleased with his endorsement of Brooks, calling him “disappointing.”He may even be considering changing his endorsement: “I’m determining right now, has Mo Brooks — has he changed?”Other candidates in the race include Katie Britt and Mike Durant. At issue for Trump was a campaign rally last August in which Brooks urged voters to move on from 2020 and focus on 2022 and 2024.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comis a professional writer and editor with over 15 years of experience in conservative media and Republican politics.

		<text>By John Hanson March 22, 2022 at 9:44amOn Monday, former President Donald Trump raised quite a few eyebrows for his description of talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump told Fox Business’ Stuart Varney of talks with Putin that “I listen to him constantly using the n-word. That’s the n-word.”While many viewers would undoubtedly think of “the n-word” as the racially charged slur, Trump clarified, saying, “and he’s constantly using it, the nuclear word.”Trump made his comments during an interview on Fox Business.

That s the n-word,  former President Trump told @FoxBusiness host Stuart Varney before clarifying he meant the  nuclear word.  pic.twitter.com/127sy5JiA4— Mediaite (@Mediaite) March 21, 2022RELATED: Joe Rogan Hammers Media For Covering Up Hunter Biden Story: ‘They Ignore Facts To Push A Narrative’After the strange description from Trump, he got down to brass tacks on how he would deter Putin.“We say, ‘Oh, he’s a nuclear power,’ but we’re a greater nuclear power,” Trump continued. “We have the greatest submarines in the world, the most powerful machines ever built and they got built under me. The most powerful machines ever built and nobody knows where they are.”Trump then said what he thinks Biden should do about the situation.“He should say, ‘If you mention that word one more time, we’re gonna send over and we’ll be coasting back and forth, up and down your coast,” Trump said.The 45th President has maintained that Russia would not have dared to invade Ukraine if he were still President. In an interview shortly after the war began, Trump told Clay Travis and Buck Sexton:“I knew that he always wanted Ukraine,” Trump said in his interview. “I used to talk to him about it.”On Russia invading Ukraine, Trump said he told Putin, “I said, ‘You can’t do it. You’re not gonna do it.”The 34-minute interview on The Clay Travis   Buck Sexton Show aired on Feb. 22.

		<text>By Becky Noble March 21, 2022 at 4:48pmDemocrats are famous for using that old rule of thumb, “never let a crisis go to waste.” Perhaps finally, Republicans might just beat them at their own game.The Republican National Committee (RNC) has begun to hold voter registration drives at the nation’s gas stations following a successful voter drive by conservative activist Scott Presler. The launch of the voter registration drives began with an event in Arizona on Saturday and will continue into the future.Coming to a gas station near you!We are registering voters across the country who are tired of Biden’s Gas Hike!https://t.co/BE54DxfQnw— GOP (@GOP) March 21, 2022RELATED: Bloomberg Lectures Americans On Inflation: Eat Lentils, Take The Bus, And Let Your Pets DieCommunications Director for the Arizona Republican Party, Ben Petersen, seemed to think the strategy was a no-brainer. He stated,“Arizonans are frustrated with paying the record-high gas prices we’ve seen recently, this is an issue that affects almost every single Arizonan. There’s no doubt that everyone is feeling the pain at the pump, so a gas station right now may be the very best possible place for one of our volunteers to have a conversation with someone and get someone signed up to vote.”Later in the day on Monday, the RNC also tweeted, “Want lower gas prices? Vote Republican!”Want lower gas prices? Vote Republican! https://t.co/00SzMc7V4J— GOP (@GOP) March 21, 2022But the idea was not the originally the RNC’s. It was the brainchild of conservative activist Scott Presler, who tweeted about the idea in early March.On March 8th, I said we were going to register voters at gas stations — we did. Promises made. Promises kept. pic.twitter.com/le3Xj5gri7— #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) March 20, 2022In fact, there was some question as to where the original idea came from, and who was taking credit for it.⁦@GOPChairwoman⁩ ⁦⁦@FoxNews⁩Reminding you that ⁦@ScottPresler⁩ started the campaign to register voters at the pump, not ⁦@GOP⁩.Scott registers voters, while Ronna ignores him, finances RINOS   takes credit for his work. 👀 https://t.co/rIAvILZLZl— Angie Blackburn (@angieblackburn) March 20, 2022RELATED: NY Post Slams Intel Officials Who Claimed Hunter’s Laptop Was ‘Russian Disinformation’: Desperate To Get Biden ElectedScott Presler’s favorite thing to do is make the top of leftists’ heads come off. And he is certainly doing it with the idea of gas station voter drives. Today, I spent 7 hours registering voters at a gas station in Manhasset, NY. I’m very sleepy   sunburned (😴+🥵), but I’ll be out tomorrow, too. (The democrats are really angry we’re registering voters at gas stations. Bless their hearts.)— #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) March 19, 2022Many liberals who responded relied on the old Saul Alinsky tactic of accusing your opponent of what you are doing.Lemme guess – just like Florida, you’re changing the party affiliations without them knowing https://t.co/qYYDyWAodm— Bill Stahl 🇺🇸 (@BillStahlJr) March 20, 2022Some got a it confused and gave away some Democrat chain of custody ballot secrets.Did you throw away those who wanted to register Democrat or Independent?— Save the Constitution (@MMareliuk) March 20, 2022And some relied on some tried and true stand by’s.Registering voters? Odd. You’re usually trying to keep people from voting.— CarbonCountyTruth (@carbon_truth) March 20, 2022As usual, Democrats try to portray themselves as never having been in the room when their policies fail. And the same is happening over who is to blame for the nation’s skyrocketing gas prices.Democrats have gone to great lengths to portray the gas price hikes as “Putin’s price hike,” but gas has been steadily increasing since Biden became President. Biden has also begun to accuse oil companies of “padding their profits.” But what Joe Biden will not tell you is that in the 2022 fiscal budget, there are at least a dozen new tax increases on American energy companies. It is not hard to figure out that those taxes get passed on to consumers.While Energy Secretary Pete Buttigieg tells everyone who can’t afford gas to buy a $45,000+ Tesla, the current average gas price in the nation is $4.25.As one good turn deserves another, I hope Scott Presler will next set up shop outside the grocery stores, too.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comBecky Noble, a political blogger and writer for over 10 years, lives by the motto, “Being normal is not necessarily a virtue.

		<text>By Becky Noble March 21, 2022 at 3:53pmIn what might appear to be questionable moves by lovers of democracy and defenders of Ukraine, the war-torn country has suspended opposition political parties and nationalized all media.President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Saturday that he would nationalize and merge all Ukrainian national TV stations into a single media entity called “United News.” The purpose is plain: to disseminate only the approved messaging of the Ukrainian government.  Zelensky Merges All Ukrainian TV Outlets Into Singular Platform to ‘Tell the Truth About the War,’ Suspends Privately-Owned Media Companies https://t.co/QWJkCcNVXt— Mediaite (@Mediaite) March 21, 2022RELATED: Cruz Blasts Fauci For Leaving Door Open To Bring Back COVID Restrictions: ‘Hell No’A statement from President Zelensky on the “unified information policy in martial law” reads that the purpose is:“To establish that in martial law the implementation of a unified information policy is a priority issue of national security, which is achieved by combining all national TV channels, the program content of which consists mainly of information and / or information-analytical programs on a single information platform of strategic communication – round-the-clock information marathon “Unique news # UArazom”.Under the guise of combatting Russian disinformation, it appears even dissenting information will be censored. Zelensky bans a dozen opposition parties, including the parliament’s second largest group.But CNN told me he was fighting for  democracy. — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) March 20, 2022RELATED: McCarthy Vows To Kick Adam Schiff Off Intel Committee If GOP Wins Back The HouseIn another move, Ukraine suspended 11 opposition political parties – including one that currently has 44 seats in the country’s parliament. Zelensky claims the reason for the ban is that the parties have “ties to Russia.” He said that the National Security and Defense Council had agreed to discontinue the activities of the parties: “Given the full-scale war waged by the Russian Federation and the ties of some political structures with this state, any activity of a number of political parties during the martial law is suspended.”POLL: Do you agree with Ukraine banning political parties and nationalizing the media?Zelensky’s actions drew a sarcastic response from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who derided him saying,“The most democratic president of modern Ukraine has taken another step towards the western ideals of democracy.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 21, 2022 at 3:21pmPopular podcast host Joe Rogan blasted the media for their efforts to squash the Hunter Biden laptop story prior to the election, saying their willingness to “ignore facts” to push a narrative “scares” him.Rogan’s comments came during a discussion with former CIA covert operations officer Mike Baker over the weekend regarding the legacy media and their love of a good story – just not one that would have been politically damaging to Joe Biden.“They don’t just love a good story. They love a narrative, and they’re willing to ignore facts to push that narrative. That’s what scares me,” Rogan said.Rogan went on to state that there are “real solid journalists” out there but he doesn’t “necessarily know if you’re getting all the information.”Baker joked, “You’re not sure?”Rogan replied, “I think it’s safe to say that some f***ery is afoot.”Joe Rogan and former CIA officer Mike Baker discuss the media’s coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop story.Read more: https://t.co/0aUhqmkdCt pic.twitter.com/47wsHoVLHF— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) March 20, 2022RELATED: Here’s The Stark Difference Between How Media Treated Hunter’s Laptop And The Steele DossierJoe Rogan proceeded to address the Hunter Biden laptop story and the media’s malfeasance in covering up the story.“The New York Times, just now, is admitting that the Hunter Biden laptop is real. And, we remember from the debates, with Trump bringing it up to Biden, and Biden saying, ‘It’s bulls***.’ And it’s a lie, a flat-out lie. Everybody knew it was a lie,” Rogan said.As the Political Insider wrote, the New York Times made a casual admission about the veracity of the laptop and contents in a story on Hunter Biden’s tax bill and the federal investigation into his business dealings.The Times buried the lede well into the article where they discussed having “obtained” emails from “files that appear to have come from a laptop abandoned by [Hunter] Biden.”“The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation,” the Times revealed.‘Intelligence’ experts refuse to apologize for smearing Hunter Biden story https://t.co/owlkCEqh2c— Jack Posobiec 🇺🇸 (@JackPosobiec) March 19, 2022RELATED: Former Intelligence Director Calls For Investigation Of Officials Who Falsely Claimed Hunter Biden Laptop Was ‘Russian Disinformation’The Political Insider also wrote about the comparative media coverage of the Steele dossier, which launched the Russiagate hoax, and Hunter Biden’s laptop at major outlets.Joe Rogan points out that nothing is improving since the Times’ admission either, noting that “nobody is apologizing” for the media’s efforts to bury the story.POLL: Do you agree with Joe Rogan?On that note, the New York Post, the outlet that broke the laptop story and the associated scandals of the President’s son, published a column revealing that former senior intelligence officials who signed a letter prior to the 2020 election claiming the story was ‘Russian disinformation’ have all thus far refused to apologize.⚠️Now Psaki Doesn’t Want To Answer Questions About Her Past Claims That Hunter Biden’s Laptop Was ‘Russian… https://t.co/XrEJaCvYDA— Junior 🇺🇸 ✠ (@SiCk_DiAbLo) March 19, 2022“More than a year later, even after their Deep State sabotage has been shown again and again to be a lie, they refuse to own up to how they undermined an election,” the Post column reads.Richard Grenell, former Acting Director of National Intelligence, has called for a Senate investigation into those officials who signed the letter.Who is going to investigate the media’s role in colluding with Democrats to sway the election?Gail Collins, a reporter for the New York Times, says that while “Hunter’s behavior was obviously unseemly in the extreme” she never found his behavior to be “criminal — just very, very depressing.”Perhaps there would have been more time to analyze that claim if not for her own newspaper aiding in the cover-up for nearly 17 months.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comRusty Weiss is a freelance writer focusing on the conservative movement and its political agenda.

		<title>Thanks To Gavin Newsom, ‘Built Ford Tough’ Really Means ‘Built In Mexico’</title>

		<text>By RealClearWire March 21, 2022 at 1:55pmBy Melissa Melendez for RealClearPolicyFord Motor Company is an iconic American brand that gave us the original Model-T, the classic Thunderbird, the groundbreaking Shelby GT 350, and, of course, the revered Mustang.The story of Ford is really the story of America told in microcosm: an ever-unfolding saga of overcoming struggle with grit; progress through innovation; and the bold and sometimes daunting belief in bringing to life what is possible but not yet is – all thanks to the potent combination of American ingenuity and unrelenting perseverance.Unfortunately for Ford, those days seem to be far in the rearview mirror. And Americans have California governor Gavin Newsom to thank for it.RELATED: Bloomberg Lectures Americans On Inflation: Eat Lentils, Take The Bus, And Let Your Pets DieEarlier this year, Gov. Newsom toured Ford’s Greenfield Labs research facility in Silicon Valley. He was there to tout a nearly $2 billion investment of California taxpayer dollars in cleaner and more cost-effective transportation as a component of the Golden State’s aggressive emissions and climate agenda.Critical to his policy prescriptions are a swift shift to no-emission vehicles, including for Ford, whose gas-guzzling F-150 remains the most popular pickup truck in America.Of course, Gov. Newsom wasn’t in Palo Alto that day to tout the F-150; his visit was focused on the news Ford Mustang Mach-E, which, unlike its fuel-injected predecessor, is a 100% zero-emission electric vehicle (EV). It represents the future of the automotive sector globally – unsurprisingly, China currently dominates the market – and could be a major economic and environmental opportunity for the United States.At this point, you may be wondering where the problem is, and you’d be forgiven for not knowing. What Gov. Newsom didn’t mention during his taxpayer-funded trip to Palo Alto was that the entirety of Ford’s global production run of Mustang Mach-Es are made not in California – or even in America – but, rather, in Mexico.This type of chicanery is old hat for the governor. Instead of going to Palo Alto to celebrate an announcement of the Mustang Mach-Es as part of a bold climate and economic vision that will benefit Californians with increased in-state investment and good, hardworking jobs, this $2 billion project, funded by California taxpayers, will see its most tangible benefits go south of the border.This is not lost on the Mexican business and political community. On March 2, an editorial appeared in Mexican newspaper Mexico Now. The author, Julio Di-Bella Roldán, vice president of public relations for the El Gran Bajío regional chamber of commerce, noted the significant financial outlays made by Ford into the country and the obvious resulting benefits: “These U.S. capital investments in facility upgrades, skills training, and new job opportunities will benefit all of Mexico, helping sustain the recovery of millions of Mexican jobs lost during the pandemic and imparting vast economic benefits well beyond a single factory.”Roldán also refers to this as an “increasingly familiar story,” raising the obvious question about what our leaders here at home are doing to protect American jobs and support a green, American manufacturing vision for the future, with EVs aplenty.RELATED: Conservative Firebrand Dinesh D’Souza Rips Biden Voters – ‘Happy’ About Karma Coming Their WayPlainly speaking, the governor’s event did nothing more than give Ford credit for its investment in EV technology with merely the appearance that the state would reap some direct benefit. Instead, jobs that should be going to hard-working Californians, and Ford’s capital investments in a greener and cleaner future, have ended up in Mexico. This makes the United States less globally competitive, especially with China, and, frankly, less green.Men like Henry Ford built America. His story is our story; as Americans, we all share in his legacy of hard work and stick-to-itiveness that gave us the foundations of American enterprise.By contrast, the governor was satisfied with what amounts to a very expensive photo op – all while consigning the possibilities of a vibrant, green, American-engineered economic future to a foreign country. That’s a legacy I know most Californians – and most Americans – would rather not embrace.Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.State Senator Melissa Melendez represents California’s 28th Senate district.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Political Insider.Don t let liberals in media silence conservatives.

		<text>By RealClearWire March 21, 2022 at 12:59pmBy Adam Andrzejewski for RealClearPolicyHigh-powered political consulting firm SKDK improperly received a $35 million contract to encourage people to vote in California in 2020 while one of the founders of the firm was advising Joe Biden’s campaign.The then-California Secretary of State Alex Padilla awarded the contract to SKDK, known for working with Democratic candidates and whose co-founder Anita Dunn works closely with Biden.The $35 million was part of a $400 million Help America Vote Act (HAVA) 2020 CARES Act Grant Fund.But California Controller Betty Yee said Padilla didn’t have the authority to award the funds, only the counties did, and she refused to pay the invoices.Later, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state legislature got SKDK its money directly from the state budget.Besides Padilla not having authority to allocate the funds, the $35 million wasn’t supposed to be used for get-out-the-vote efforts.RELATED: New Bills Would Expose Russian, Chinese Funding Of American GroupsHAVA gives emergency funds to states to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus for the 2020 federal election cycle. It was not to encourage people to vote.In addition, Padilla awarded the contract to SKDK without following the state’s competitive bidding process, another firm alleged.Mercury, one of the seven firms that bid on the contract, said SKDK was allowed to submit 49 pages, far beyond the 15-page limit that other firms were held to, and was awarded the contract in an expedited manner.This was all going on while Anita Dunn was working for Biden’s campaign. Her firm received $35 million — improperly from several angles — to encourage voters to cast ballots.She later joined the Biden White House as advisor and refused to fill out ethics forms.Three Congress members, Reps. James Comer (R-Ky.), Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) and Jody Hice (R-Ga.), wrote several letters: first to Padilla, then to one inspector general of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, then to that IG’s successor, as well as to a commissioner of the commission, highlighting how the $35 million was illegally spent.But all their letters have been met with radio silence. No investigation, no questions asked.With such a blatant conflict of interest being allowed, it’s no wonder Americans don’t trust the fairness of our elections.Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.The #WasteOfTheDay is presented by the forensic auditors at OpenTheBooks.com.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Political Insider.Don t let liberals in media silence conservatives.

And no apologies,” they wrote.Clapper, in fact, doubled down that signing the letter was the right thing to do.“Yes, I stand by the statement made AT THE TIME, and would call attention to its 5th paragraph.

		<text>By John Hanson March 21, 2022 at 11:37amOn Friday, the White House’s top medical doctor Anthony Fauci said that he “can’t stay at this job forever,” teasing a possible forthcoming retirement.  Fauci, who is 81, made his remarks during an interview on ABC’s “Start Here” podcast with host Brad Mielke. I can’t stay at this job forever,  admitted Dr. Fauci.  Unless my staff is gonna find me slumped over my desk one day.  https://t.co/WDbFWZIP1N— Mediaite (@Mediaite) March 18, 2022RELATED: MSNBC’s Joy Reid Complained That ‘Media’ Wasn’t Covering ‘Non-white’ Wars – That She Ignored CompletelyFauci said of his role during the COVID-19 pandemic, “I have said that I would stay in what I’m doing until we get out of the pandemic phase, and I think we might be there already, if we can stay in this.”His comments might not jive with other comments he made Sunday, suggesting that COVID restrictions may need to come back.Nevertheless, he then teased that he could be retiring in the near future.“I can’t stay at this job forever,” Fauci said. “Unless my staff is going to find me slumped over my desk one day. I’d rather not do that.”“I, unfortunately, am somewhat of a unidimensional physician-scientist-public health person. When I do decide I’m going to step down — whenever that is — I’m going to have to figure out what I’m going to do,” Fauci continued. “I’d love to spend more time with my wife and family, that would be nice.”Since 1968, Fauci has worked at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Fauci became the director of the NIAID in 1984. In January 2020, former President Donald Trump oversaw Fauci becoming a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.Fauci has famously clashed with Republican Senator Rand Paul, who has consistently been one of the doctor’s harshest critics, particularly with Paul claiming Fauci has lied about U.S. funded “gain-of-function” research conducted in a Chinese lab.Last week, Sen. Paul proposed an amendment that would eliminate Fauci’s position of director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Fauci is the highest paid federal employee, earning well over $400,000 annually.No one person should have unilateral authority to make decisions for millions of Americans. https://t.co/I3g6pbm6nW— Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 14, 2022RELATED: Former Intelligence Director Calls For Investigation Of Officials Who Falsely Claimed Hunter Biden Laptop Was ‘Russian Disinformation’“We’ve learned a lot over the past two years, but one lesson in particular is that no one person should be deemed ‘dictator-in-chief,” Paul said in a statement. “No one person should have unilateral authority to make decisions for millions of Americans.”The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions rejected Sen. Paul’s measure.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comis a professional writer and editor with over 15 years of experience in conservative media and Republican politics.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 21, 2022 at 11:10amAn op-ed column published by Bloomberg received a fair share of criticism after advising Americans on how to cope with soaring prices due to inflation.The column, authored by Teresa Ghilarducci, was published last week but garnered renewed interest as the outlet promoted the work on social media.Ghilarducci thankfully points out that skyrocketing inflation ‘only’ truly wreaks havoc on the budgets of those making under $300,000 annually. (Or, 98% of the population.)She advises Americans to take public transit instead of driving their own vehicles, switch their diets from meat to vegetables, and even consider letting their pets succumb to illnesses that require chemotherapy treatment.From selling your car to forgoing chemotherapy for your dog, @tghilarducci has tips on how to beat inflation (via @bopinion) https://t.co/6d9UR1PJ6f— Bloomberg Economics (@economics) March 13, 2022RELATED: Journalist Scolds Americans: Support Ukraine And ‘Stop Whining’ About Higher Gas PricesGhilarducci, who some sites estimate has a net worth from anywhere between $1-$5 million, provides Bloomberg readers with “some ideas on how to reconfigure consumption and lessen the blow” of inflation under President Biden.“To deal with gas prices, it’s worth reconsidering public transportation if it’s an option where you live,” she writes.Ghilarducci also advises Americans to change their diet and “consume plants directly,” specifically suggesting “lentils and beans.”➡️ Go to a kick-boxing class➡️ Have a margarita https://t.co/HAYotAOCId— Jon Gabriel (@exjon) March 19, 2022One of the more alarming pieces of advice from the Bloomberg op-ed is a suggestion to essentially let your family pets die because medical costs could get in the way of your new inflation-necessary budget.“If you’re one of the many Americans who became a new pet owner during the pandemic, you might want to rethink those costly pet medical needs. It may sound harsh, but researchers actually don’t recommend pet chemotherapy …” she advises.A tweet promoting the column explains: “Nobody said this would be fun.”Inflation stings most if you earn less than $300K. Here’s how to deal:➡️ Take the bus➡️ Don’t buy in bulk➡️ Try lentils instead of meat➡️ Nobody said this would be fun https://t.co/HGJEoXL5ZZ— Bloomberg Opinion (@bopinion) March 19, 2022RELATED: Washington Post Rushes To Defend Biden Over Supply Chain Crisis: ‘Americans Need To Lower Expectations’Critics were many over the Bloomberg column offering advice on how to deal with inflation.Former Texas State Representative Matt Rinaldi kindly suggested “‘get rid of your car and eat lentils instead of meat ” may not be a “winning message” for Democrats heading into the midterms.I don’t think “get rid of your car and eat lentils instead of meat” is a winning message for Democrats. https://t.co/gtxBAVEm5U— Matt Rinaldi (@MattRinaldiTX) March 20, 2022Columnist Jim Treacher provided his own snarky bullet-point list mimicking Bloomberg’s which includes advice such as “learn to pole dance” and “Does Mom really need a funeral?”➡️Learn to pole dance➡️Buy an RV and get cookin’➡️Try candles instead of electricity➡️Does Mom really need a funeral?https://t.co/i2KACAwKlg— jimtreacher.substack.com (@jtLOL) March 19, 2022James DePorre, CEO of Shark Investment Management and Real Money contributor, points out that Ghilarducci’s absurd advice applies to nearly everybody in the country.“Only about 1% of the population makes over $300,000 a year,” he wrote.Perhaps that’s where the disconnect comes from. The elites look down on the average American and can’t see why they simply can’t respond to Bidenflation by upending everything about their lives and budgets.From ‘eat lentils,’ to ‘you should be happy to pay more for gas,’ to ‘just buy an electric car,’ they really have no understanding of what Americans are going through.Jen Psaki tells Americans who are angry over the state of our nation to get a margarita and go to a kickboxing class.Are you kidding me? The majority of Americans can’t AFFORD to get a margarita or go to a kickboxing class due to the inflation caused by Biden! pic.twitter.com/6ATt9waaxN— Congresswoman Debbie Lesko (@RepDLesko) January 24, 2022Bloomberg isn’t the first media outlet to scold Americans to change their ways when it comes to the Biden economy.Several months ago, the Washington Post told readers to stop complaining about the supply chain crisis and simply lower expectations.Opinion: Don’t rant about short-staffed stores and supply chain woes. Try to lower expectations. https://t.co/3CLpV5HXbG— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 19, 2021A Yahoo finance reporter earlier this month advised Americans to “stop whining” about higher gas prices because it’s a great way to support Ukraine.“Americans who want to support Ukraine don’t have to like higher prices, but they can fill up knowing there’s a good cause on the other side of the world,” the op-ed reads.A recent poll shows 70% of Americans disapprove of President Biden’s handling of gas prices while an equal number disapprove of his handling of inflation.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comRusty Weiss is a freelance writer focusing on the conservative movement and its political agenda.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 21, 2022 at 10:41amRepublican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy vowed to remove Democrat Adam Schiff of Russiagate fame from the House Intelligence Committee should Republicans win back the majority in the midterms.McCarthy, during a press conference on Friday, accused Schiff of undermining the integrity of the committee by using it as a political football.“Why is he still chair of the committee and why is he still even on the committee? In a new Congress, if it’s a new majority, he will not be,” the California Republican openly wondered.“You cannot make this committee political, you cannot use it as a position of chairman to lie, and you should be focused on what the American people want you to be focused on around the world,” McCarthy continued.Schiff has been serving as the House Intelligence Committee chairman since 2019..@GOPLeader: “What did we just find out yesterday from the New York Times? Yes, it is Joe Biden’s laptop. And yes, Adam Schiff lied to us one more time. Why is he still chair of the Intelligence Committee? […] In a new Congress, he will not be.” https://t.co/Y3XoXlIgr5 pic.twitter.com/NQZx8XnuMI— The Hill (@thehill) March 19, 2022RELATED: Report: McCarthy Will Oust Omar, Schiff, And Swalwell From Committee Assignments If GOP Wins The HouseMcCarthy noted how as Intel Committee chairman, Adam Schiff helped peddle the false narrative that Hunter Biden’s laptop was little more than Russian disinformation.The Political Insider reported last week that the New York Times had “authenticated” emails from the President’s son’s laptop.Schiff, like many who supported Joe Biden’s candidacy leading up to the election, told the American people not to believe reports regarding Hunter’s laptop.“We know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin,” he said in an interview with CNN. “That’s been clear for well over a year now that they’ve been pushing this false narrative about the vice president and his son.”“This whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin,” says House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, reacting to the FBI leading an investigation into whether unverified emails about Hunter Biden are tied to a Russian disinformation effort targeting his father’s campaign. pic.twitter.com/DMSaw5MdSf— The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) October 16, 2020Schiff doubled down in the same interview: “Clearly, the origins of this whole smear are from the Kremlin, and the president [Trump] is only too happy to have Kremlin help and try to amplify it.”McCarthy said Schiff is only motivated by politics.“The worst part of it is, you cannot trust what he tells you, that he lies to us,” said McCarthy. “Two years ago, Schiff stated the emails found from Hunter Biden were all a whole smear on Joe Biden that comes from the Kremlin. That’s what the head of the Intel said,” McCarthy explained.“Adam Schiff lied to us one more time.”Adam Schiff lied. About Russian collusion. About meeting with the “whistleblower.” And about Hunter Biden’s laptop.Why is Speaker Pelosi still allowing him to be on the Intelligence Committee?— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) March 20, 2022RELATED: McCarthy May Give Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar ‘Better’ Committee Assignments If GOP Takes Back CongressThis isn’t the first time McCarthy has vowed to remove Adam Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee, though the Hunter Biden laptop episode adds more fuel to the fire.Earlier this year, the Republican leader said he plans to remove Schiff and fellow Democrat Representatives Ilhan Omar and Eric Swalwell from their committee assignments should the GOP win back the House in 2022.POLL: Should Adam Schiff be kicked off the Intelligence Committee?He noted that Swalwell (CA) cannot get a security clearance in the private sector and should therefore not be serving on any committees, a reference to the Democrat’s alleged relationship with a Chinese spy.Tucker Carlson says that “U.S. Intelligence officials believe” that a suspected Chinese spy “had a sexual relationship with” Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell (CA) and that Swalwell’s office couldn’t comment on it because they said that info might be “classified”pic.twitter.com/biV78uVZHB— Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) December 9, 2020McCarthy also hinted at Omar’s (D-MN) ouster in the same interview.“Ilhan Omar should not be serving on Foreign Affairs,” McCarthy said. “This is a new level of what the Democrats have done.”Adam Schiff’s office said it would be “catastrophic” if Republicans take the House in 2022 and remove him from the intelligence committee, as Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Breitbart News he would do in an exclusive interview. https://t.co/fagwsPPs1U— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 10, 2022McCarthy has also insisted that Republicans who have been removed from their committee assignments by Democrats for political reasons over controversial comments will be restored to committees, perhaps even finding themselves in better roles.“They’ll have committees,” McCarthy vowed of Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ). “They may have other committee assignments.”In fact, he added, “They may have better committee assignments.”Greene was removed from the Education and Labor Committee as well as the Budget Committee for ill-advised social media posts made prior to her election to office.Gosar was removed from the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Natural Resources Committee after posting a parody cartoon video.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comRusty Weiss is a freelance writer focusing on the conservative movement and its political agenda.

But most people are not capitalists, because they don’t have capitalist money. They’re not billionaires.”The self-described socialist then told viewers that discussing policy should matter more than labels.“The label doesn’t matter as much as talking about policies,” Ocasio-Cortez whisper. “That’s easier to understand.”She then proceeded with policy specifics, saying, “Do you think people should die because they can’t afford insulin? Do you think that fossil fuel CEOs should decide whether the planet gets set on fire?”“Me neither,” AOC added.Apparently this is her idea of “talking about policies.”Ocasio-Cortez’s whispering video appeared to be part of Q A session on her Instagram story. She was apparently asked by a follower, as could be seen in text above her head, “How do you respond when people accuse you of being a ‘socialist’?”AOC’s whispering is reminiscent of President Joe Biden, who has had a habit of doing the same thing.In January, Biden answered a reporter’s question about school closings by whispering.WATCH: In a rare press conference, President Joe Biden whispers his answer to a reporter. pic.twitter.com/5yGfrqHocV— Newsmax (@newsmax) January 19, 2022Biden was whispering answers to reporters in June 2021 as well, which many rightly found bizarre.Last week, Joe Biden snapped at the press.This week he s whispering at them. pic.twitter.com/2R54bmbZp5— Townhall.com (@townhallcom) June 24, 2021RELATED: MSNBC’s Joy Reid Complained That ‘Media’ Wasn’t Covering ‘Non-white’ Wars – That She Ignored CompletelySen.

And we have had a lot of very important successes with that — resources with regard to the vaccinations, the drugs, the tests, all the things that have actually worked well,” Fauci replied.COVID restrictions have slowly been easing over the past few months, with most states dropping mask mandates as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have adjusted their guidelines. A  Missing Person Alert  posted on a Facebook page gave his last-known whereabouts:  Dr Anthony Fauci, was last seen several weeks ago ‘following the science’ and has not been heard from since.  https://t.co/Dz2cL0eBjj— The Independent (@Independent) March 18, 2022Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comBecky Noble, a political blogger and writer for over 10 years, lives by the motto, “Being normal is not necessarily a virtue.

		<text>By Becky Noble March 18, 2022 at 4:07pmNewsmax host Eric Bolling got a chance to do what perhaps millions of Americans would love to do, call MSNBC’s Joy Reid out onto the carpet for her glaring hypocrisy and yes, racism.As the war in Ukraine rages on, Reid decided to do what many of her left wing colleagues so often do: make it about race.However, Bolling didn’t let her slide. Let’s not throw stones in glass houses, shall we not, Joy? @ericbolling asked where @JoyAnnReid s  coverage of Yemen  was after the @MSNBC host complained about the racial  disparity  regarding war reporting. https://t.co/yWu6GIOaS7— Mediaite (@Mediaite) March 18, 2022RELATED: Ukraine’s Zelensky Ominously Claims World War III ‘May Have Already Started’On Monday, Reid whined about what she perceived, as she always does, as some sort of racial “disparity” over war coverage in Ukraine versus other parts of the world:“Now, what we’re seeing in Ukraine is absolutely the worst humanitarian crisis that Europe has seen in decades, but we haven’t witnessed the same type of solidarity for the Yemenis as we do for the Ukrainians. We don’t see historic sanctions or global campaigns, corporations like Airbnb and Netflix taking a stand.”But Reid was just warming up for what her true accusation against western media was.“And this is not to say we shouldn’t care this much for Ukraine – far from it. The point is, we should also care this much for refugees in those facing occupation and war in the Middle East, and Asia and Africa too. The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to Western media compared to their browner and blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war.”Surely with such a complaint, Reid – as part of the media, with a daily primetime national TV show – would regularly cover the war in Yemen, right? Wrong!It feels like maybe we should have paid more attention to Putin’s brutality toward Syria… but of course, those were brown Muslim people so…— Joy-Ann (Pro-Democracy) Reid 😷 (@JoyAnnReid) March 16, 2022RELATED: Now Psaki Doesn’t Want To Answer Questions About Her Past Claims That Hunter Biden’s Laptop Was ‘Russian Disinformation’Since that segment aired on her show, Reid has all completely ignored the Yemeni war and anywhere else there might be unrest in “browner” countries than Ukraine.Mediate helpfully analyzed Reid’s show – only to discover that since her complaint, she has not covered Yemen and had largely ignored it before then.It is here that Eric Bolling went in for the kill. He disputed Reid’s claim that world wide media is not covering conflicts like the one in Yemen and elsewhere. “These tragic events do get global media coverage. Articles are written every day. Airstrikes, peace negotiations, humanitarian crises, it’s all out there.”Bolling then proceeded to show clips of Reid’s exhaustive coverage of, wait for it, Russia and Ukraine. Bolling then asked, “Well, look at that, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Zelensky, Ukraine. But, Joy, where’s your coverage of Yemen, Somalia, Syria? She’s had days and days to cover more of the wars and famines in the rest of the world.”Bolling then summed up Joy Reid’s entire agenda, not just her implication that the world does not care about clashes in countries that are non-white, but her agenda in general saying, “When you find yourself making a judgment on a situation based on the color of a person’s skin, you might find that perhaps you are the one being racist.”JOY REID A GRAND WIZARD! WATCH😂 pic.twitter.com/0YTB53QfmS— 🤎Thought💭Criminal🤎 (@BipolarMe81) March 17, 2022RELATED: Democrat Senator Warner Claims Russia’s Military Clearly ‘Not What It Was Built Up To Be’If there is a story that can even remotely be made about race, Joy Reid is on the case. And if there are people who disagree with her views on race, well, those people probably have a hood and some sheets in their closet.In February, Reid discussed parents becoming more involved in their local school boards. Reid brushed off parents’ concerns over their childrens’ education, saying that “It’s about selling white grievance and rage.”In October of 2021, Reid came to the “conclusion” that Republicans did not want “non-white” people voting. Her “proof” of this:“And that they have divorced themselves from the idea of a multiracial democracy because a multiracial democracy means when people who look like me vote for somebody, that person can be allowed to win.”And last May, Reid claimed that the teaching of critical race theory is being fought because “the right” to avoid teaching America’s “true” history of race:“They want Americans to just shut up and feel good about America’s founding and sing from the hymnal, so they don’t even have to think about dealing with the repercussions of our true history and the need for repair.”Nothing new for Joy Reid.Joy Reid of the MSNBC Joy Reid🤣really is filled with a lot of hate and pretty good mix of  racism …EVERYTHING is racist to her.

Yet the Republican Party embraces him as a hero. https://t.co/xTYpgIscBS— Mary L Trump (@MaryLTrump) March 18, 2022Civil rights lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill reminded followers that Rittenhouse’s use of self-defense to save his own life was “one of the most alarming [and] frightening episodes of the past few years.”It was frightening, just not for the reasons she believes.What was frightening was that three men, some with serious criminal backgrounds, were almost able to kill a teenager during a serious riot. But he thankfully was able to defend himself.What’s frightening is that the left and the media then characterized Rittenhouse as a murderer and he was almost jailed for life over that false narrative when he was put on trial this past November.What’s frightening is that they continue to lie about what happened.The latest meme from Kyle Rittenhouse is precisely why in the ⁦@NYTmag⁩ roundtable I described the reaction to this child killing two ppl as one of the most alarming   frightening episodes of the past few years.They want to make remorseless children.https://t.co/YxLt9NIItq pic.twitter.com/NGHeeH3LRj— Sherrilyn Ifill (@Sifill_LDF) March 18, 2022“The Kyle Rittenhouse video is a cry for a ‘Dancing With The Stars’ slot,” tweeted comedian Paula Poundstone.Poundstone, you may recall, was arrested on child abuse charges in 2001.If you were a Rittenhouse juror, you must feel REALLY special right now, huh?? https://t.co/TZOFfwuAbX— Katie S.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 18, 2022 at 12:50pmRichard Grenell, former Acting Director of National Intelligence, is calling for a Senate investigation into former senior intelligence officials who signed a letter prior to the 2020 election stating the Hunter Biden laptop story was ‘Russian disinformation.’Grenell called for hearings should Republicans win back control of the Senate in the midterm election.“A Republican Senate MUST hold hearings with all 50 of the people who signed that letter 3 weeks before the 2020 campaign,” he tweeted.“They all said Hunter Biden’s laptop was Russian disinformation. And they didn’t have a single piece of intel to suggest it,” he added.He posted a follow-up message demanding: “Hold people accountable for manipulating intelligence for political gain!”A Republican Senate MUST hold hearings with all 50 of the people who signed that letter 3 weeks before the 2020 campaign.

Some of these people appear to this day on CNN and MSNBC as esteemed experts on the war in Ukraine. The least they should do is declare a conflict of interest. pic.twitter.com/36ituz51MU— Miranda Devine (@mirandadevine) March 17, 2022Still, they felt compelled to publish the letter to sway public opinion and dissuade voters from taking the story seriously.“If we are right, this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election, and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this,” the letter reads.They weren’t right.The letter was signed by some very prominent officials so as to lend credence to the claims.Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former CIA Directors Mike Hayden, John Brennan, and Leon Panetta, all signed the letter.Here’s a letter signed by over 50 top IC officials claiming the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation.Includes Clapper, Brennan, Morrell, etc. Joe Biden   Psaki said it too.Imagine taking any of these people remotely seriously today. https://t.co/rbHZEvBOyW— Jordan Schachtel @ dossier.substack.com (@JordanSchachtel) March 17, 2022RELATED: White House Officials Briefing Media On How To ‘Reshape’ Negative Coverage Of The Biden AdministrationFormer Acting DNI Richard Grenell, in subsequent tweets, accused each of the over 50 officials of manipulating their position to aid Joe Biden in winning the election.“I will tell you this – every single one of those 50 intel officials who signed that letter saying that Hunter Biden’s laptop was Russian disinformation did NOT have a single piece of raw intel indicating it was,” he accused.“They made it up the last weeks of the campaign to help Joe Biden.”Everyone who said that the laptop was NOT Russian disinformation was blocked or banned from @twitter   social media.Is there a single DC reporter who isn’t asking how this happened? And why did Leon Panetta sign a letter saying it was Russian disinformation?! https://t.co/qfPw7FKupj— Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) March 17, 2022“These 50 people manipulated intelligence for political gain,” added Grenell. “And it’s outrageous.”Radio host Clay Travis suggested there needs to be “a full congressional investigation” into Big Tech ‘collusion’ in trying to hide the Hunter Biden laptop story.The efforts to censor the story at the time and the seemingly coordinated effort to bury it as ‘Russian disinformation’ sure seem to suggest some level of coordination between the Biden campaign, the intelligence community, and the media.Senator Tom Cotton chimed in calling Big Tech’s efforts to hide the story “a disgrace.”The New York Times admits what we’ve known for years: the Hunter Biden laptop story was true.Big tech’s censorship of this story was a disgrace.— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) March 17, 2022“Everyone who said that the laptop was NOT Russian disinformation was blocked or banned from [Twitter and] social media,” Grenell said. “Is there a single DC reporter who isn’t asking how this happened?”Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comRusty Weiss is a freelance writer focusing on the conservative movement and its political agenda.

		<text>By RealClearWire March 18, 2022 at 11:15amBy J. Peder Zane for RealClearInvestigationsTalk about burying the lead. In the 24th paragraph of an article detailing the Department of Justice’s ongoing probe into Hunter Biden’s finances, the New York Times finally acknowledges the authenticity of material on the infamous laptop the president’s son abandoned in a Delaware repair shop. The key passage reads:Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation.This, of course, is the same laptop – filled with explosive allegations of sketchy deals with foreign governments and suggestions of payoffs to Joe Biden – that the Times and other mainstream outlets ignored or dismissed as “Russian disinformation” after the New York Post first reported on it in October 2020.  Twitter and Facebook banned the Post from sharing its reporting.As the Post reported today:In the heat of the presidential race of 2020, the Times never missed a chance to cast doubt on the laptop, saying the information was ‘purported’ and quoting a letter from former Democratic officials who claimed — with no evidence — that it was Russian disinformation. As recently as September 2021, the Times called the laptop ‘unsubstantiated’ in a news story.RELATED: Now Psaki Doesn’t Want To Answer Questions About Her Past Claims That Hunter Biden’s Laptop Was ‘Russian Disinformation’Of course anyone with a pulse knew the laptop was real. While then-candidate Joe Biden trotted out the “Russian disinformation” narrative, his dissolute son Hunter never denied the possibility that the laptop belonged to him. In addition, a former business partner of the Bidens, Tony Bobulinski, came forward at the time to both debunk Joe Biden’s lie that he never discussed foreign business with his son and to claim that Joe was getting a cut of the profits.The damage of this disinformation campaign orchestrated by Democrats and their media allies is incalculable. Given Biden’s razor-thin margins in several swing states, it is worth asking if he would have been elected president had these allegations of corruption received a full and fair airing. One poll by a conservative outfit found that 17 percent of Biden supporters said they might have changed their vote.Now that the Times has deigned to confer legitimacy on the laptop, the big question is whether it will pursue its leads.The place to start would be the 2017 email regarding a deal with Chinese energy executives that states, “10 held by H for the big guy?” We know H is Hunter and Bobulinksi has said that Joe was commonly referred to as the “big guy.”Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Political Insider.Don t let liberals in media silence conservatives.

		<text>By John Hanson March 18, 2022 at 10:24amOn Wednesday, Democratic Senator Mark Warner said that after invading Ukraine, Russia’s military is “not what it was built up to be,” implying that the Russian invasion is going poorly, performance-wise.The commentary is notable in that, if true, it weakens the case for American politicians’ demands that Ukraine needs immediate, massive military assistance.Warner made his remarks during an interview on CNN’s “Situation Room.”Democrat @MarkWarner reacts to President Joe Biden calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a  war criminal,  and tells CNN s @wolfblitzer that Putin has become  more and more isolated.  pic.twitter.com/U7504U7n4J— CNN (@CNN) March 16, 2022RELATED: Fox’s Jesse Watters Slams ‘Trigger Happy’ Journalists For Supporting A No-Fly Zone: ‘Begging For War’CNN host Wolf Blitzer told Warner, “You and most of your colleagues, I’m sure, think Putin is a war criminal for what he’s done in the past few weeks in Ukraine. I know you’ve done a briefing. House chairman Adam Schiff came out and dismissed rumors there’s any serious movement on a potential diplomatic move between Ukraine and Russia. What is your understanding?”Warner replied, “On that diplomatic deal, I didn’t get a chance to fully press that. I saw the report. I think this war is going to go on. I would pray for a diplomatic solution, but in many ways, that would be left up to the Ukrainian leadership and the Ukrainian people.”There have been a few attempts at negotiating a cease-fire between the two sides, though none have yet been successful.Warner then questioned the strength of Russia’s military.“Clearly, at every turn, the Russian military is not what it was built up to be,” the senator said. “Their execution, frankly, in terms of not even taking out the Ukrainian air command systems, the fact that over half of the Ukrainian air force and more is still up and operating is, frankly, malpractice on the part of the Russian military planners.”Warner’s comments are very curious. If Russia has not yet even attained air supremacy over Ukraine, it begs the question of why so many – including Ukrainian President Zelensky – have demanded a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over the country.CNN White House correspondent @mj_lee reports on Ukrainian President Zelensky s moving message to Congress and President Biden telling reporters that Vladimir Putin is a  war criminal.  pic.twitter.com/cpeQ8FQ5BM— CNN (@CNN) March 16, 2022RELATED: Republican Dan Crenshaw Says Conservatives Who Oppose War With Russia Use ‘Putin’s Talking Points’Warner added, “I do think it’s important we continue to send them additional assistance into literally tens of thousands of antitank tools, tremendous increase in the number of Stingers, and I applaud the administration while not getting into the actual systems, but applaud them saying we will get longer range anti-aircraft tools to Ukrainians where they could gain some control over their skies if they have those longer-range anti-aircraft tools.”“So I think the Ukrainians are doing quite well, but we need to continue to rush arms and equipment and not just us, but our European allies and others as well,” he finished.Warner appears to be in line with the American people on that note. A poll conducted by Pew shows high support for various American actions against Russia. In fact, over a third of Americans would even favor direct military action, even if its risks nuclear war. Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comis a professional writer and editor with over 15 years of experience in conservative media and Republican politics.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 17, 2022 at 3:22pmA New York Times report on Hunter Biden’s tax bill and the federal investigation into his business dealings confirm the existence of the President’s son’s infamous laptop.Hunter reportedly took out a loan to pay off more than $1 million in back taxes following a launch of a Justice Department inquiry into his tax affairs in late 2020.The first son, just weeks after the election and only after his father’s victory had been certified, revealed that federal prosecutors in Delaware had been investigating him.The New York Times reports on emails they “obtained” which have been examined by those prosecutors which purportedly reveal information about “foreign business activity” including the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, on whose board Hunter served.“Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop,” the report reads.They add, “The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation.”In the category of – didn’t see this coming : The ⁦@nytimes⁩ confirms the authenticity of Hunter Biden emails derived from his laptop that had been previously dismissed as Russian disinformation. pic.twitter.com/nK7xnD0fP2— Michael Isikoff (@Isikoff) March 17, 2022RELATED: Psaki Angered By Questions About Hunter Biden’s ‘Laptop From Hell’The media deliberately buried a New York Post story involving emails found on Hunter Biden’s laptop prior to the 2020 presidential election.The New York Post was censored on social media at the time – before the election – for sharing the story.The New York Times was part of the effort to dismiss the story as “misinformation.”“The story about the laptop was an old-fashioned, politically motivated dirty tricks campaign, and describing it with the word ‘misinformation’ doesn’t add much to our understanding of what happened,” they reported over a year later.They initially described news of the laptop as “unsubstantiated” as late as September of 2021, but quietly altered that description.The New York Post couldn’t help but jab the Times over their new admission that Hunter Biden’s laptop is legitimate.“Forgive the profanity,” the Post Editorial Board wrote Thursday, “but you have got to be s–tting us.”The original New York Post 10/14/20 Hunter Biden laptop story.

The NYT buries its confirmation of the story in paragraph 27. https://t.co/be9cPkXsKF— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) March 17, 2022RELATED: Hunter Biden Prosecutor Waited To Reveal Tax Investigation Until After ElectionEven as it seemed obvious that the President’s son’s laptop and its contents were legitimate, the media and Team Biden set about burying the story as ‘Russian disinformation.’White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, just a few months ago, grew rather irritated when a reporter asked questions about Hunter Biden’s infamous “laptop from hell” and challenged her to admit it was not Russian disinformation.“My colleague Miranda Devine has a new book out called ‘The Laptop From Hell’, and I was hoping that you could confirm that the laptop is indeed authentic and not Russian disinformation as you seemed to suggest on Twitter last year,” New York Post reporter Steven Nelson asked.Psaki would not confirm either aspect.“As it relates to the book, I’ve neither had the time nor interest in exploring or reading the book,” she fired back.BREAKING: Psaki is asked if she will admit that the Hunter Biden Laptop is real and not “Russian Disinformation” — She did not like this question. pic.twitter.com/4Zu6nAJMdZ— Benny (@bennyjohnson) December 6, 2021I’d like to see that question posed to Psaki again now that the New York Times has admitted the laptop is real.President Biden even made the ‘Russian disinformation’ claim well after the election.“Mr. President-elect, do you still think that the stories from the fall about your son Hunter were Russian disinformation and a smear campaign like you said?” Fox News reporter Peter Doocy asked.Biden replied, “Yes, yes, yes.”Joe Biden laughs when Fox News’ Peter Doocy asks if he still thinks the allegations against Hunter Biden are Russian disinformation:“Yes, yes, yes. God love you, man. You’re a one horse pony.” pic.twitter.com/x8HEvPjpFn— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) December 22, 2020TIME Magazine published an investigative piece titled, “The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election,” in February.The report detailed how an extensive network of powerful and wealthy people ran a “shadow” campaign in order to ‘save’ the election and control the dissemination of information before and after.The secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 electionhttps://t.co/xG3S60cP2L— TIME (@TIME) February 5, 2021“A well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage, and control the flow of information,” Time revealed.The column references a little-known effort by “a veteran progressive operative” to combat “disinformation” on social media platforms.One of the best ever @newsbusters clips out there! pic.twitter.com/s8muZMfOYq— Raheem J. Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 10, 2020Facebook and Twitter, of course, ended up playing large roles in the election. Twitter stepped up to the plate by censoring and removing posts about the New York Post article involving emails found on Hunter Biden’s laptop.The New York Times finally admitted the story is real. Why did it take so long?The Post has a theory.“Now we’re 16 months away from the 2020 election, Joe Biden’s safely in the White House, and the Times finally decides to report on the news rather than carry the Biden campaign’s water,” they write.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comRusty Weiss is a freelance writer focusing on the conservative movement and its political agenda.

		<text>By John Hanson March 17, 2022 at 2:52pmOn Wednesday, press secretary Jen Psaki had a somewhat tense exchange with a reporter over sending “offensive” weapons to Ukraine.The back and forth took place during the daily White House briefing.RELATED: New Media Low: Journalists Mock Fox News Over Deaths Of Cameraman, Producer In UkraineGray Television White House correspondent Jon Decker noted that some of the weapons included in the Ukraine assistance package included 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns.He then asked Psaki if these qualified as “offensive weapons.”Psaki said, “They’re weapons that help the Ukrainian people fight against an invasion by a foreign country.”Decker asked again, “They can be used offensively, can they not?” “Again, what I’m talking about is weapons used to fight…” Psaki said before Decker interrupted.“The answer is yes, I mean, although you don’t want to say it,” Decker insisted. “That answer to that question is yes. And so obviously you’re trying to make this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons…”Then Psaki interrupted him.“Well we’re talking about … let me finish, let me finish, let me finish,” Psaki shot back at the reporter. “Let me finish, because I’ll give you my point,” Decker replied. “I was finishing a point and then you can respond to my answer.”While any firearm can clearly be used in an offensive or defensive manner, the reporter ultimately revealed his true intention: to push the Biden administration to send even more weapons to Ukraine, asking “Why not provide more offensive weapons like this to the Ukrainian military?”Decker’s question, which reads more like a suggestion or even a plea, comes as Fox News’ Jesse Watters excoriated journalists for almost universally demanding further American involvement and escalation in the conflict.“Most of the partisan columnists at America’s largest newspapers agree,” Watters said. “And most of the mainstream media reporters are begging for a no-fly zone.”“The most trigger-happy people in this country seem to be journalists,” he added.Watch Decker and Psaki’s exchange here:RELATED: Keith Olbermann Wants Tucker Carlson And Tulsi Gabbard Arrested By The Military For Being ‘Russian Assets’President Joe Biden signed the $800 million package on Wednesday.“The American people are answering President Zelensky’s call for more help, more weapons for Ukraine,” the president said.JACQUI TIME: “Can you lay out for us why the administration sees MiGs as provocative and javelins and stingers as not provocative?”Psaki: “Well… javelins and stingers are defensive weapons.

		<text>By RealClearWire March 17, 2022 at 12:57pmBy Philip Wegmann for RealClearPoliticsAt the beginning of the pandemic, the previous president had a vision – one his scientific advisors urged him to abandon. Not only did Donald Trump want the economy back open, he said that by Easter Sunday of 2020, “you will have packed churches all over the country.” It never happened, at least not on the scale he envisioned.Two years later, after millions of vaccines have been administered and the virus has receded from its peak, things look very different. A sign of the times: After two years, the White House plans to resume regular public tours. Doors are scheduled to open on Good Friday.As Biden officials smile about the poetry of that rhyming calendar, the White House is dealing with a political paradox: How to secure more COVID aid from Congress as the administration pivots away from the pandemic. It’s proving to be a hard sell.RELATED: Comptroller’s Audit Finds Former NY Governor Andrew Cuomo ‘Misled The Public’ On Nursing Home DeathsThe same morning the White House announced a return to business as usual for tourists, the administration raised the alarm about a virus they believe is on the run. Cases are down 95% since the peak of the omicron variant. Hospitalizations have similarly plunged by 85%. More than 215 million Americans are already fully vaccinated. Yet officials warned on a call with reporters Tuesday morning that their pandemic coffers could soon be empty.“For months, we’ve made clear to Congress, on a bipartisan basis, that the funding for tests, treatments, and vaccines was drying up and that additional funds would be needed,” the official said.How much money do they need? The number administration officials floated was $22.5 billion. And if they don’t get it? White House budgeteers will make trims to the request. They warn, however, that the U.S. won’t have enough boosters or variant-specific vaccines “for all Americans,” according to a fact sheet provided by the administration.They won’t be able to buy monoclonal antibody treatments, either, and the current supply is expected to run out as soon as May. Without a cash infusion, they predict that the testing capacity will collapse.Governors were warned late Tuesday morning that the administration would be reducing the number of monoclonal antibody treatments by 30% within a week.Republicans say they aren’t necessarily opposed to more COVID spending. They just want to know where all the other COVID cash went first, as Sen. Richard Shelby explained to Politico. “There’s a doubt that they need this money with a lot of us,” explained the Alabama Republican. “I’ve said this for weeks, a real accounting of the money [already spent on COVID] that the American people deserve and then go from there. If there’s no money left, and it’s not hidden somewhere, and if they show a need, then you got, maybe, a persuasive case.”Asked if the White House would negotiate for a lower number, a Biden official gave an emphatic “no.” And when then asked if they would accept using different funds for their COVID priorities, the official demurred, saying only that “the money they provided over a year ago has been well spent, but we defer to Congress on the specific legislative approach.”It is a routine kind of squabble, albeit one that comes at the tail end of a once-in-a-century pandemic. The difficulty for Biden may be that the public is moving on after he pivoted away from the virus during his State of the Union address. Masks are increasingly uncommon these days. Dr. Anthony Fauci has receded from the cable news circuit. News of a land war in Europe now eclipses COVID coverage.RELATED: Rand Paul Proposes Amendment To Eliminate Fauci’s Government Position EntirelyWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told RealClearPolitics that COVID funding was a necessity, despite the public’s shifting attention. “We’re in a different stage and we have a range of tools in order to fight the pandemic,” she explained, adding that in order to keep up that fight, “We need money.” A new subvariant of the virus, BA2 omicron, has already made it to American shores. It is apparently even more transmissible than the original Omicron strain, Psaki noted, but also treatable. “We need to have masks, tests, boosters, treatments for [the] immunocompromised in order to continue to treat the American people during a pandemic,” she said. “So, it remains urgent.”That urgency was underscored by breaking news Tuesday evening. At least nine Democrats had already tested positive for the virus after those lawmakers attended a party retreat last week in Philadelphia. The president was also at the event, but he tested negative Sunday night, Psaki told reporters. Then, Kamala Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff tested positive.The vice president had stood shoulder to shoulder with Biden earlier in the day at an indoor event, and she was expected to share the stage with the president at an event in the East Room of the White House to celebrate “Equal Pay Day.” The room was packed front to back, but Harris wasn’t there.“Earlier today, the Second Gentleman tested positive for COVID-19. Out of an abundance of caution, the Vice President will not participate in tonight’s event,” the White House announced just moments before Biden entered the room. “The Vice President tested negative for COVID-19 today and will continue to test.” The president shrugged off the news like it was routine.“Welcome to the White House,” Biden told the crowd that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and numerous members of his cabinet. “This is the biggest crowd we’ve had since we got here.” Only later, after a gaffe where he mistakenly said that “the first lady’s husband contracted COVID,” did Biden ask the mostly unmasked crowd to send to Harris “our love.”Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Political Insider.Don t let liberals in media silence conservatives.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 17, 2022 at 11:29amFox News host Jesse Watters slammed media personalities who have been demanding the United States implement a no-fly zone in Ukraine as reckless and “trigger-happy.” Watters, host of ‘Jesse Watters Primetime’ and co-host of ‘The Five,’ voiced his support for President Biden’s efforts to arm the Ukrainians in defense of the Russian invasion.But the no-fly zone, as some like even Marco Rubio has pointed out, would be direct conflict with nuclear Russia.Watters initially mocked the ladies of “The View,” calling them “the greatest military minds on daytime television” before playing a clip of co-host Sunny Hostin saying a no-fly zone is necessary because “we are already in a war with him.”Spoiler alert: We are NOT at war with Russia.Utterly oblivious to the consequences and the dangers of enforcing it, The View’s Sunny Hostin demands a no-fly zone over Ukraine.And she seems to think NATO is already at war with Russia. pic.twitter.com/mgJLwCxK1g— Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) March 7, 2022RELATED: Tulsi Gabbard Demands Mitt Romney Resign After He Accuses Her Of ‘Treason’Jesse Watters responded to the “generals of The View” calling for a no-fly zone in Ukraine by gently explaining that such a move would lead to war with Russia.“Most of the partisan columnists at America’s largest newspapers agree,” Watters said. “And most of the mainstream media reporters are begging for a no-fly zone.”He went on to argue that “not even Republican hawks” are calling for a no-fly zone in Ukraine.“The most trigger-happy people in this country seem to be journalists,” he added.“It’s like, ‘Can we please get into a shooting war with Russia? ” Watters joked. “‘I mean, if not now, maybe later can we start shooting Russians?’ It’s crazy. The only people asking for that are Zelensky and American journalists.”Watch, beginning around the one-minute mark:RELATED: New Media Low: Journalists Mock Fox News Over Deaths Of Cameraman, Producer In UkrainePresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a plea to Congress on Wednesday for a no-fly zone in Ukraine, something he has consistently called for, invoking historical tragedies such as 9/11 and Pearl Harbor to garner support.“‘l have a dream,’ these words are known to each of you today,” he said. “I have a need, a need to protect our sky. I need your help.”‘Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people’ — In his address to the U.S. Congress, Pres.

I didn’t realize Putin was our national security adviser.” – @DanCrenshawTX this AM pic.twitter.com/S9lRxRVjpQ— Justin Discigil (@JDiscigil) March 16, 2022RELATED: Hunter Biden On List Of Americans Sanctioned By RussiaCampos-Duffy, the wife of former Wisconsin Republican congressman Sean Duffy, noted that there is a debate among the Republican base on whether the U.S. should intervene or not, and pointed out that those urging caution are often portrayed as “Putin supporters or traitorous.”Crenshaw doesn’t think there is a major split on this issue within his party.“I don’t think it’s as evenly split as you make it seem on the Republican side,” Crenshaw told Campos-Duffy. “I think it’s a very small minority that believes that we shouldn’t care about anything that goes on in the world.”“That’s not what I said,” Campos-Duffy shot back.Crenshaw continued, “I know, but that’s what a lot of people say and they do repeat Putin’s talking points and that’s a problem. When they start repeating Putin’s talking points and repeating lies about Ukrainians.”He didn’t explain what “lies about Ukrainians” are supposedly being “repeated.”“I don’t think so,” the Fox News host replied.Crenshaw then tried to flip the America First argument on its head.“It is not America First to watch around the world as Russia and China take over and destroy our allies,” Crenshaw claimed. “That’s America Last.”Dan Crenshaw: Putin is not our national security adviser https://t.co/KJN4s4x0kp You need to begin your discussions  at home  with your most prominent Fox voices: Carlson, Hannity, Watters, Ingraham cause otherwise you are a vacuous echo chamber.— Mac (@mactisch) March 16, 2022RELATED: After Blaming ‘Putin’s Price Hike,’ Biden Now Blames ‘Greedy’ Oil Companies For High Gas PricesCampos-Duffy stood up for Republican who want restraint and the notion that having that view makes one a tool of Russia.“Congressman, I just want to make a point,” Campos-Duffy told Crenshaw. “I appreciate your perspective, but since you did say that it’s repeating Russian talking points I’m just going to have to push back. I’m not repeating Russian talking points, and I think I represent the way a lot of other conservatives feel. I don’t think they’re repeating Russian talking points.”“They’re not isolationists, they’re seeing, for example, the alignment of China and Russia because of the way this war was handled,” she continued. “I think they’re seeing a lot of things and I think on the Republican side saying they’re repeating Russian talking points shuts down conversations and does not allow us to have a robust debate which we should be having,” she continued.Crenshaw said that calling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky a “thug” and claiming that aid is going to neo-Nazis is “repeating Russian talking points.”On the latter point, the existence of neo-Nazis in Ukraine has long been covered by the media. In 2018, Congress even banned the most well-known of them, the Azov Battalion, from receiving aid.POLL: Who do you agree with more: Dan Crenshaw or Rachel Campos-Duffy?Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comis a professional writer and editor with over 15 years of experience in conservative media and Republican politics.

		<text>By Rusty Weiss March 16, 2022 at 12:18pmHealth officials in New York under disgraced former governor Andrew Cuomo “misled the public” on the number of nursing home deaths in that state during the pandemic “even after” it had corrected any discrepancies privately.This, according to an audit released on Tuesday by the state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli.The audit concludes that Cuomo’s Health Department failed to account for the deaths of over 4,000 seniors in nursing homes.Then-Governor Cuomo issued an executive order on March 25th, 2020, which forced nursing homes to take on patients that had tested positive for coronavirus.The order prohibited nursing homes from requiring incoming patients “to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.”The audit notes that health officials almost immediately and frequently altered their defining parameters for reporting nursing home deaths to the public “with virtually no explanation.”“All told, for the nearly 10-month period from April 2020 to February 2021, the Department (of Health) failed to account for approximately 4,100 lives lost due to COVID-19,” it says as a key finding to the report.New York comptroller audit concludes Cuomo admin undercounted COVID nursing home deaths | Fox News https://t.co/WuMldYphlg— Janice Dean (@JaniceDean) March 16, 2022RELATED: Task Force Concludes Cuomo’s Nursing Home Policy Did Lead To More Nursing Home DeathsThe state comptroller’s audit marks the third official inquiry into the scandal that concludes Cuomo’s administration significantly downplayed the number of nursing home deaths during the pandemic.The crux of the issue comes from officials initially only counting deaths that physically took place in nursing homes, not those involving seniors who were transported to a hospital and passed away there.The New York Times points out that hiding the true number was beneficial to Cuomo’s career.“Those efforts coincided with Mr. Cuomo’s attempts to elevate his public image at the height of his national popularity in 2020, including through daily televised briefings and the publication of a book that burnished his response to the pandemic,” the Times reports.The latest audit removes any doubt that the administration intentionally fudged the numbers at times.The Times notes that “the administration was aware of the higher death toll and continued to withhold it even after it had apparently corrected most discrepancies by May 2020, a few months into the pandemic.”No amount of desperate preening TV ads will cover for Cuomo’s crimes.Kathy Hochul now owns this Cuomo legacy. Her silence and inaction is deafening.There must be accountability   justice for families who lost loved ones. https://t.co/r52L9qyEM5— Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) March 15, 2022RELATED: Disgraced Former Gov. Cuomo Ordered To Pay Back $5.1 Million From COVID Book DealThe audit on Cuomo’s nursing home cover-up comes as the former Governor has been squirming his way back into the public eye for what many assume will be an attempt at a political comeback.He has released multiple political ads in the last few weeks.Part of the hubris involved in making such a comeback comes because Cuomo was forced to resign over sexual harassment allegations that fizzled out from a criminal aspect, and has never paid a price politically – despite three separate investigations pointing out he misled the public – over the nursing home scandal.But, as state assemblyman Ron Kim argues, these latest findings are criminal in nature and should be treated as such.“This is criminal public fraud that led to unnecessary deaths,” he said.This is criminal public fraud that led to unnecessary deaths. https://t.co/SwwXu3e3r7— Ron T. Kim (@rontkim) March 15, 2022A statement by DiNapoli says the findings are indeed “troubling.”“Our audit findings are extremely troubling,” he said. “The public was misled by those at the highest level of state government through distortion and suppression of the facts when New Yorkers deserved the truth.”“This is the third independent report to verify his misconduct,” Kim added. “His deadly policies lead to thousands of deaths and ruined countless others.”“He suppressed life and death data that lawmakers would have needed to truly protect all New Yorkers.”Cuomo’s actions were never about protecting our most vulnerable, they were about pure egotism and self-enrichment at the cost of others’ lives.My full statement on ⁦@NYSComptroller⁩’s nursing home report: pic.twitter.com/zrUImr95Mg— Ron T. Kim (@rontkim) March 15, 2022Will this audit finally lead to accountability?This past summer, President Biden’s Department of Justice (DOJ) declined to investigate whether the civil rights of residents in the state’s nursing homes were violated by Cuomo’s admission policy related to the pandemic.Kathy Hochul, who replaced Cuomo as New York governor after his resignation, apologized to the families of those who lost loved ones in nursing homes. Those families expressed optimism that Hochul would pursue accountability for what happened.Dear @GovKathyHochulIn light of @NYSComptroller’s nursing home state audit, you need to call for a complete top to bottom bipartisan investigation of what happened in New York nursing homes and the part your administration played in deaths of thousands of seniors.— Janice Dean (@JaniceDean) March 15, 2022Instead, Hochul’s Health Department responded to the audit by deflecting responsibility to the previous administration.“Whatever criticisms may now be directed at the prior administration relating to issues of transparency, or the particular categories of information that were publicly disclosed, those ultimately were matters for the executive chamber of the prior administration and not department personnel,” wrote Kristin M. Proud, the department’s acting executive deputy commissioner, in a letter of response.Hochul served as Lieutenant Governor under Cuomo, making her part of that prior administration.“The state should provide the families who lost loved ones with answers as to the actual number of nursing homes residents who died,” DiNapoli said. “These families are still grieving, and they deserve no less.”Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comRusty Weiss is a freelance writer focusing on the conservative movement and its political agenda.

		<text>John Cochrane s blogThree additional thoughts on climate financial regulation, building on the last post about the SEC  1) A big question about SEC and related regulation. May the SEC regulate only on financial issues, i.e.  materiality,  or may it regulate with larger social, economic, or political objectives in mind? The big squeeze now is to squeeze the latter in to the former. Disclose that the company doing something unpopular, even if it may have no financial effect, because someone might decide they don t like it -- either the twitter mob or future regulators -- and cause you trouble. (I am deliberately not using legalize here.) The carbon rules are not entirely new ground here, but so deep into that territory that the question is now loud and clear. 2)  Disclosure  usually means revealing something you know. A perfectly honest answer to  disclose what you know about your carbon emissions  is,  we have no idea what our carbon emissions are.  Back that up with every document the company has ever produced, and you have perfectly  disclosed.  There is no asymmetric information, fraud, etc. The SEC has already required the production of new information, and as Hester Peirce makes perfectly clear, the climate rules again make a huge dinner out of that appetizer: essentially telling companies to hire a huge number of climate consultants to generate new information, and also how to run businesses.  The fixed costs alone are huge. The trend to going private and abandoning public markets, at least in the U.S. will continue. The trend to large oligopolized politically compliant static businesses in the U.S. will continue. I would bet these rules wind up in court, and that these are important issues. They should be. 3)  The SEC s timing relative to Russian sanctions makes an interesting one-two punch, as Walter Russell Mead points out. Suppose you re Brazil. Hmm. When will the U.S. decide to impose financial sanctions on Brazil for not following our ideas of climate policy, or the SG (social, governance) part of ESG? Maybe we should find alternative financial channels, pronto.  I m yet to read the 500 page PDF, but am curious, do Scope 3 disclosures include the greenhouse gas emissions from employees? Like, hiring someone with a longer commute may result in higher emissions reported, underuse of work from home policies, or even use of labor in high emissions markets (USA) vs low emissions (take your pick of developing countries).If not, it creates a disadvantage from employing Capital vs Labor - if energy use on servers/forklifts/conveyor belts must be captured, this then creates a disincentive to employing such labor saving technologies if you re not capturing the carbon  savings  from not needing people to perform the procedures anymore. Another nudge against productivity growth. The SEC has already required the production of new information, and as Hester Price [*] makes perfectly clear, the climate rules again make a huge dinner out of that appetizer... . [*] Commissioner Hester M. Peirce.Typo at [*].OT, but maybe worth pondering as a similar type of over-reach.  ARLINGTON, Va. -- The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday approved Nasdaq s groundbreaking proposal to boost the number of women, racial minorities and LGBTQ people on U.S. corporate boards.The new policy — the first of its kind for a U.S. securities exchange — requires most of the nearly 3,000 companies listed on Nasdaq to have at least one woman on their board of directors, along with one person from a racial minority or who identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer. It also requires companies to publicly disclose statistics on the demographic composition of their boards. ---30---There are lot of reasons to feel uncertain about this Nasdaq rule. Including...do we want to get into people s private sex lives? Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

In more local practice, a method of recreating the Salem witchcraft trials.--The federal government is pursuing contradictory policies, or wishes or rhetoric, on energy prices and the environment. That needn t bother politicians who appeal to one or the other or both interest groups. And it doesn t. The [political] chickens will surely come home to roost, but not just yet.The following thoughts were provoked by an abridged review of the 510-page S.E.C. document:  The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors , [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33-11042.pdf].The proposed rules will have an effect similar to the effect that  Sarbanes-Oxley  had on registration and new public listings, i.e., negative.Apart from the obvious creation of demand for more accountants and corporate lawyers, the proposed rules will increase the potential liability of corporate boards of directors and executives and officers of registrants.The level of detail stipulated in the proposed rules will give rise to costs that will likely outweigh the possible benefit that the rules are intended to achieve.The time horizons for the projected  likely material effects  are not specified, but comments are invited on whether the proposed rules should specify ranges (in years) for  short- ,  medium- , and  long-term  horizons. The rule notification suggests 1-3 years or 1-5 years for short-term material effects, etc., up to and including 40 to 50 years for long-term material effects. This begs the question of the reliability of forecasts out to those horizons and the difficulty of determining the probability of events that would give rise to future  likely material effects  that would require disclosure under the proposed rules. A new caste of  fortune tellers  will be needed to foretell those events and the probability of occurrence.It is easy to imagine that firms adversely affected by the proposed rules will soon be considering de-registration. The proposed rules cover foreign corporations registered with the S.E.C. Those foreign corporations may soon be considering de-registration. Private corporations that may have been considering going public in the U.S. will now have to re-consider those plans if the proposed rules impose onerous filing requirements (cf.  Sarbanes-Oxley ).The evident absence of balance between the cost of preparing the disclosures required under the proposed rules, and the alleged benefits accruing to shareholders from those required disclosures will need to be addressed by the Commission if it is to meet its legislative mandate.Administrative law in the U.S. is increasingly burdensome. At some point, the attractiveness of U.S. markets to corporations seeking raise risk capital will decline. We may be witnesses to that decline in the coming years.The trend towards  going private , exemplified by Dell Computer, may be given a boost by the proposed rules. At a minimum, as noted earlier, corporations will find it increasingly difficult to recruit qualified candidates for membership on corporate boards of directors, officers and executives.What will the industrial basis of the United States look like in ten, twenty, or fifty years from now? Will manufacturing be outsourced to Asia to the extent that no sizeable manufacturing base is present in the U.S.? To avoid having to report Scope 3 emissions (upstream suppliers  and downstream distribution chains  and customers  emissions), corporations will refrain from making commitments to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Is this a desireable outcome for these proposed rules?This doesn t even address the best/worst part. Since almost anything now can be deemed to be securities fraud, crafty lawyers for climate activists will take advantage of the necessarily sweeping but nebulous disclosure calculations to assert fraud claims against disfavored companies and industries. The nuisance will cost defendants millions to defend. Same as it ever was.In my nearly 40 years of reading SEC disclosures, the only purpose for imposing such nebulous disclosures is to feed the plaintiff s bar--another area for plaintiff lawyers to go after companies with so-called strike suits. Shameful as it is obvious. There will never be sufficient disclosures to satisfy the plaintiff bar because stuff happens, the future is not known and cannot be known. Looking backwards, as these lawsuit do, is a con.This looks like a data grab - not entirely bad if we want evidence based policies. But I figure it ll just be another form of accounting where 2 + 2 = fish. I don t think it ll be good data. Curious. After Raskin withdrew as Biden s Fed nominee over a clash about her climate views. Hayek put it best.  Pretense of knowledge.  SEC regulators can t have all the information necessary to implement this nonsense. Thinking on the margin, how are firms to know the habits of their suppliers and customers? In the real world of unpredictability the disclosures demanded by the SEC introduces more risk into capital markets. The cost of compliance for a hedge fund managing a billion dollars costs around six million dollars a year. the opportunity cost has to be the market rate of return. When implemented, I suspect compliance costs will substantially increase. I am very happy to be retired from my former trade of corporate lawyer. One of my tasks was preparing my clients annual SEC filings. My clients were small public companies. One of them was a chain of 20 to 30 sitdown restaurants in the  casual dinning  sector (not fast food not white table cloth).They probably could have disclosed how much natural gas and how much electricity they purchased every year, but telling you what their emissions were? Good lord, they were chefs not engineers.But the idea of disclosing:  GHG emissions from ... downstream activities in its value chain  is downright funny.  We estimate that the food consumed in our restaurants produced 100,000 pounds of poopoo and 100,000 gallons of peepee. Additionally we sold 50,000 servings of bean chili that produced 10,000 cubic feet of intestinal gas containing 70% methane which is a very potent GHG.Our government is being run by lunatics. It is not a good feeling while the Russians are brandishing nuclear weapons while they murder innocent civilians.The Fed and SEC entering climate policy-making...seems like using a hammer to garden with.I have an idea. If we wish to reduce carbon emissions, let us tax fuel consumption. Preferably in exchange for lower wage taxes...but hey, why reward productive behavior?This seems to mirror the conflict minerals disclosure which seems to be required of all companies, given the number of annual reports with a section that basically says  we don t manufacture anything so don t use minerals. Barron s sees that the SEC is using regulation to dictate climate policy:https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-climate-risk-disclosure-rule-51647880796 SEC Unveils New Rules to Combat Climate Change  By Lauren Foster FollowUpdated March 21, 2022 6:07 pm ET / Original March 21, 2022 12:41 pm ETThw Western world has been going mad for decades, this is just an extension of the self-destructive trend.This really seems like an overreaction to disclosure rules. I would understand such criticisms about a extensive regulation of alleged  climate risks , but this outcry just because companies will be required to disclose their environmental performance is excessive and sounds more like a pretext for anti-climate regulation than a serious point of substance. ESG investing is a real thing, whether you like it or not. And ESG investors need information on environmental performance of companies. What is wrong with giving such investors a sound information basis? This allows better matching of demand and supply. Since when is Mr Cochrane against efficient markets?I lost 7 figures on HQS, a microcap Chinese tilipia farm on AMEX. Total fraud. SEC did nothing. Worthless. CEO, or anyone else didn t even get their wrist slapped. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/857073/000119312510207346/dex991.htmComments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

		<description> p  nbsp; /p  div  br /  /div  div Viewer mail, on Ukraine. I think it was a really good conversation.  a href= https://www.hoover.org/research/viewer-mail-ukraine-edition  target= _blank  Direct Link /a  /div </description>
		<text>John Cochrane s blog While the interview is interesting, the speakers seem to miss a major point. That is how infinitely more important Ukraine for Russia than it is for the West. Just look at the map. I would not be surprised if Russia will fight this war not only until the last Ukrainian soldier, but until the last Russian soldier and the last piece of bread. In contrast, the American public will likely switch their attention away once the war ends and there is some other news. Why could not Ukraine stay a neutral country that is friendly to both the West and Russia? This would have been great for the Ukrainian economy, Ukraine would have kept Crimea and there would have been no war now. Ukrainians want to join the EU, and Russia has not opposed this (e.g., it does not oppose Serbia joining the EU). As for NATO, why to hurry and ignore Russian position? This could have been postponed for, say, 50 years until Putin is gone and Russia becomes more democratic. What a blunder! The West did not act in the best interest of Ukraine, while claiming to be its friend, and even Ukrainian politicians did not, probably because they listened to their Western advisors too much. Why? Because Ukraine is a free and independent nation and has the right to decide for themselves what countries that want to align themselves with. NATO is not an organization that has a history of aggression with its neighbors and is, in fact, founded on the notion of providing a defense against Soviet Union aggression (now Russia), which does in fact not only has a long standing of aggression against its neighbors but continues to have a goal of world-wide hegemony. Ukrainians have been subject to the Russian way of life and they have independently voted to reject it. By what thinking does Putin believe he has the  right  to upend the wishes of more than 40 million people.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

		<text>John Cochrane s blogIf the above embed doesn t work, direct link here at the Hover website, along with podcast for audiophiles. Niall touched on it briefly a bit: the role of desperation.Remember, The Third Reich came to power because Germany had embraced a man who they believed would return them to greatness. Germany was once the home of mystics in Europe and home of the Rational Enlightenment. But the crushing economic obligations placed upon the Germans to prevent the resurgence of a belligerent European power ended up blowing up in their faces. Why? Desperation has a way of pushing people to the edge. Remember, Putin has been quoted as saying,  If there s no Russia, why do we need the world? The other mistake I see, again, comes from lessons in WWII. Letting Adolf run amok in Europe for years led to a very, very, very BAD conflict later on. I m concerned NATO is allowing the same thing with Putin. Regardless of which outcome comes forth, it will be rooted in desperation and avoiding shame. China is certainly taking notes on everything being done on both sides. And, today! Saudi Arabia will accept the Yuan for oil. Bye bye petro dollar?It was a good episode. Mike Gallagher comes across as an impressive person   HR was in his element. I prefer the Goodfellas episodes with someone who has real knowledge about something -- rather than people who are professional yakkers. Thanks for an interesting conversation. Niall Ferguson seemed to be the most informed and closest to the reality, which is to be expected, as a historian he knows the history of the conflict and the history of Ukraine and Russia. I am glad that John seemed to back up on enforcement of a no-fly-zone, and he ruled out bombing Moscow. It would be nice if the conversation discussed the events leading to the war, such as USA arguments, Ukrainian arguments, Russian arguments, NATO expansion, and other major relevant events. Well, I guess this would be out of scope and would take too much time. Great episode - highly recommended!Impression: The U.S. military is becoming less capable, not more capable, according to the participants in this latest Goodfellows segment. H.R. McMillan: Give the Ukrainian forces medium-range surface-to-air and surface-to-ship missiles to create a no-fly zone above Ukraine. N. Fergusson: The conflict in the Ukraine is part of a larger developing conflict; limiting the discussion to theaters, such as the Ukraine, the Middle-East, or Indo-Pacific regions, is an incorrect approach. M. Galligher: The direction that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff are headed is entirely wrong and misguided--focus on the present and near-term needs/risks; the Biden administration s emphasis on climate change is doing great damage to the economy and the ability of the nation to contend with these risks.The discussion was informative. It presented four perspectives and some useful alternatives, but fell short of a consensus on a coherent strategy to be followed due to lack of time.Thanks for posting the video.Comments are welcome.

		<title>Irwin on trade reform</title>
		<description> p  a href= https://sites.dartmouth.edu/dirwin/  target= _blank  Doug Irwin  /a of Dartmouth gave a really informative talk at the Hoover Economic Policy Working Group, based on his paper  a href= https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/pandp-2022-1048-1.pdf  target= _blank  The Trade Reform Wave 1985-1995 /a , AER May 2022. nbsp; nbsp;Embed (hopefully) below, or go to  a href= https://www.hoover.org/events/policy-seminar-douglas-irwin  target= _blank  the link here /a .  nbsp; /p  nbsp; div  br /  /div  div  br /  /div  div Doug opened my eyes, hence this post. I love learning something new. I m a resolute Free Trader. So, naturally, I jump to the answer: Stop protecting industries. Get rid of tariffs. Don t bother with the negotiated mercantilism of trade deals -- the  you can sell to us if our exporters can sell to you  deals. The point of a foreign country s exports is to get dollars, and the point of dollars is for them to buy from the US. Full stop. nbsp; /div  div  br /  /div  div Doug reveals that this story is far too simplistic to understand the closed economies of the 1950s through 1970s, and the great trade liberalization that the world experienced starting in the 1980s -- and which we are very sadly likely to lose in the years ahead. A little reminder of what we gained, and a sad peak: nbsp; /div  div  br /  /div  div class= separator  style= clear: both; text-align: center;   a href= https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhc08U26yJOgDRn5NxJYCdXv4JGKHAD9ZenWn2Yc1lXWltsZKVFEyKRxa5ga1OPuX7iJcsmtrn6rRSCOUFuxOUT8xLshDhmGoMy8W_rX4tMZ7aALNpvBZWoA_EZt7kdsoCW-kQ-SpeECcMz5Z5_hETe68ohzrTeJJ-76gGRQyQRWfQOF5uFh3zUH0c=s2310  style= margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;   img border= 0  height= 233  src= https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhc08U26yJOgDRn5NxJYCdXv4JGKHAD9ZenWn2Yc1lXWltsZKVFEyKRxa5ga1OPuX7iJcsmtrn6rRSCOUFuxOUT8xLshDhmGoMy8W_rX4tMZ7aALNpvBZWoA_EZt7kdsoCW-kQ-SpeECcMz5Z5_hETe68ohzrTeJJ-76gGRQyQRWfQOF5uFh3zUH0c=w400-h233  width= 400  /  /a  /div  br /  div  br /  /div  div  br /  /div  div  div The process of liberalization started with money, not tariffs: Countries first devalued overvalued currency, usually to a floating rate. Then they eliminated quantitative restrictions on imports including import licenses. Then they reduced tariffs. nbsp; /div  /div  div  br /  /div  div In turn, how did they get there, and why did they not reform earlier? The standard story pits domestic industry vs. consumers. Domestic industries have concentrated interest in protection, consumers are diffuse. That accounts for status quo bias, but not why they eventually changed. nbsp; /div  div  br /  /div  div The source of the problem, and reason for the change is different. Countries (especially in the  developing  world) were hit with a  terms of trade  shock -- they exported commodities, say, to import goods; the commodity price went down so they could not buy imports. Many countries were financing imports with foreign aid and borrowing, and those transfers dried up. nbsp; /div  div  br /  /div  div What do they do? They have to choose between deflation, currency depreciation, or import controls.  nbsp;Deflation at the same exchange rate makes foreign goods more expensive. Depreciation does the same, without changing the domestic price level. Or, stop imports by direct controls, and by rationing foreign exchange leading to a black market. In the early postwar view, consistent with Bretton Woods, they chose the latter. (Why is there so much nostalgia for Bretton Woods? It was a rotten system.) nbsp; /div  div  br /  /div  div Naturally, it didn t work. Eventually they gave up and devalued or floated the exchange rate. Now there is no need to ration foreign exchange or to restrict imports by license. (Tariffs are bad, but quantitative restrictions are worse, since you never know what the cost is, and then imports are allocated by political rather than economic reasons. Just paying a tax is more efficient!) They moved to exports in order to generate foreign exchange to buy imports. nbsp; /div  div  br /  /div  div  div class= separator  style= clear: both; text-align: center;   a href= https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhn1W-sFxGS884lqGrqtganTnIfEAzxWfVV5ZypzGEsDZCRSnWQyJ8_U-YjVeNzeJIaqG-aXmNiR2qvzLsrsaLbdT2D6v_g_r7nJCMbY0jv1LEl7083ihkphyypC_YlVigJ97B7Z_0evHHASOuuuTaM6uDeJpMoDtEHa2nVDU8dkkA6wYaBP5AH4is=s1676  style= margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;   img border= 0  height= 290  src= https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhn1W-sFxGS884lqGrqtganTnIfEAzxWfVV5ZypzGEsDZCRSnWQyJ8_U-YjVeNzeJIaqG-aXmNiR2qvzLsrsaLbdT2D6v_g_r7nJCMbY0jv1LEl7083ihkphyypC_YlVigJ97B7Z_0evHHASOuuuTaM6uDeJpMoDtEHa2nVDU8dkkA6wYaBP5AH4is=w400-h290  width= 400  /  /a  /div  br /  br /  /div  div class= separator  style= clear: both; text-align: center;   a href= https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgYq6cg9k7AOWF1JtFesWMo11nffi3fH2xp-ONr_JfFLmfcY0usGboqY0SAmPUfQ559l05RNT9OLkywLHj-xTevcDDLgWFGjHzay-2OvL_CdcKtD1GXuI9czRFeWt__CogzClv8bkvGBWiIBGSWt5N8xdc0XYT8hrnt7ooPqUAFCaCxJt6_hSztG-I=s1548  style= margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;   img border= 0  height= 346  src= https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgYq6cg9k7AOWF1JtFesWMo11nffi3fH2xp-ONr_JfFLmfcY0usGboqY0SAmPUfQ559l05RNT9OLkywLHj-xTevcDDLgWFGjHzay-2OvL_CdcKtD1GXuI9czRFeWt__CogzClv8bkvGBWiIBGSWt5N8xdc0XYT8hrnt7ooPqUAFCaCxJt6_hSztG-I=w400-h346  width= 400  /  /a  /div  br /  div  br /  /div  div So, Doug answers the central question: nbsp; /div  blockquote  div Why no reform in 1970s? “foreign exchange reserves kill the will to reform” nbsp; /div  /blockquote  div Oil and commodity export countries were flush with cash to buy imports.

That also used to be gospel, now under debate. Doug s answer was interesting: In these cases, a free currency market was crucial, but free capital markets less so. Thanks for your -as always- instructive content. Is there any way I can receive your posts in my email automatically? Something like a newsletter?The conversation session captured in the video serves to remind us that the U.S. and most other countries are  open economies  to a greater or lesser degree. As such,  closed-economy  models, such as the three-equation new Keynesian DSGE model, are inapplicable to much of the World s economies. Fiscal policy interacts with monetary policy and balance of payments in open economies, as is well known. In a closed economy, the interaction with the balance of payments is absent (no imports or exports of goods or capital occur in a closed economy). One could argue that taken as a whole, the global economy is a  closed economy  and, as a consequence, the three-equation new Keynesian DSGE model would apply if there was but one fiscal and one monetary authority. That ideal does not exist at present, of course, and the three-equation new Keynesian DSGE model remains a theoretical curiosity for the present. Where does the fiscal theory of the price level fit in an open-economy model? It does fit, but it requires modification to take into consideration balance of payment constraints and international capital flows because the economic system is open. Theoretical thermodynamics, for example, distinguishes between a closed system in which there is no interchange between the system and the environment not in the system, and an open system in which interchange with the surrounding environment is a material part of the system dynamics. Most published papers on the FTPL base their analyses on closed economic system dynamics. Adaptation of the FTPL to open economies would broaden and deepen the applicability of the theory to the practical issues facing modern economies. Thanks for posting the video it was most educational and served as a welcome refresher course for international business and international finance graduate courses taken forty-years ago.Comments are welcome.

		<title>The Biden-Blinken Doctrine</title>
		<description> p Over the weekend, the U.S. declared a no-fly zone off the table.  a href= https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-on-nbc-meet-the-press-with-chuck-todd/  target= _blank  Secretary Blinken on NBC News with Chuck Todd: /a  nbsp; /p  blockquote  p QUESTION:  nbsp;... Why rule out the no-fly zone?  nbsp;Why not make Putin think it’s possible? /p  /blockquote  blockquote  p SECRETARY BLINKEN: ...The President’s been very clear... we’re not going to put the United States in direct conflict with Russia, not have American planes flying against Russian planes or our soldiers on the ground in Ukraine, because for everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the President also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war, with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands even beyond Ukraine to Europe.  nbsp;That’s clearly not our interest.  nbsp;What we’re trying to do is end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one.... nbsp; /p  /blockquote  blockquote  p And by the way, keep in mind what – again, keep in mind what a no-fly zone – just so people understand, too, what a no-fly zone means.  nbsp;It means that if you declare a space no-fly and a Russian plane flies through it, it means we have to shoot it down. /p  /blockquote  p If country A nakedly invades country B, and country A has the ability to expand to a wider war, especially nuclear, then the US will not fight. Not only we do not fight directly, we do not declare a no-fly zone. If country B has an explicit defense treaty with the US, such as NATO, we might, but otherwise, you re on your own. nbsp; span  /span  /p  a name= more   /a  p  /p  p This announcement follows NATO secretary Stoltenberg making the  a href= https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-wont-establish-no-fly-zone-over-ukraine-jens-stoltenberg-says/  target= _blank  same peremptory announcement /a . nbsp;I focus on the US because the wider implications for the US making this pronouncement. nbsp; /p  p I do not wish to argue with this judgment in the instance of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin. The administration, and NATO, are making a judgement that sending weapons and crushing the Russian economy with sanctions are not too  provocative,  but that declaring a no-fly zone is.

		<text>John Cochrane s blogOver the weekend, the U.S. declared a no-fly zone off the table. Secretary Blinken on NBC News with Chuck Todd: QUESTION:  ... Why rule out the no-fly zone?  Why not make Putin think it’s possible?SECRETARY BLINKEN: ...The President’s been very clear... we’re not going to put the United States in direct conflict with Russia, not have American planes flying against Russian planes or our soldiers on the ground in Ukraine, because for everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the President also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war, with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands even beyond Ukraine to Europe.  That’s clearly not our interest.  What we’re trying to do is end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one.... And by the way, keep in mind what – again, keep in mind what a no-fly zone – just so people understand, too, what a no-fly zone means.  It means that if you declare a space no-fly and a Russian plane flies through it, it means we have to shoot it down.If country A nakedly invades country B, and country A has the ability to expand to a wider war, especially nuclear, then the US will not fight. Not only we do not fight directly, we do not declare a no-fly zone. If country B has an explicit defense treaty with the US, such as NATO, we might, but otherwise, you re on your own. This announcement follows NATO secretary Stoltenberg making the same peremptory announcement. I focus on the US because the wider implications for the US making this pronouncement. I do not wish to argue with this judgment in the instance of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin. The administration, and NATO, are making a judgement that sending weapons and crushing the Russian economy with sanctions are not too  provocative,  but that declaring a no-fly zone is. They are making a judgement that Ukraine can survive without it, and that the extra death and destruction in Ukraine is not worth the risk. I hope people are questioning this judgement, but pundits should  defer a little bit to people in charge with lots of information on such judgement calls. But given this decision, why rule it out? Why say it out loud? Why make it a matter of principle, now a doctrine? They could simply not do it, and keep Putin guessing. That achieves the end that a U.S. finger does not pull the trigger on a U.S. weapon that sends a U.S. bullet or missile in the direction of a Russian pilot. They could call Putin and say  We re not putting in a no-fly zone. Don t worry, your attack is safe from the air.  This time. But they did not. Once again, the U.S. declares, publicly, ahead of time -- ahead of the possible collapse of the Ukrainian government -- what we will not do, and elevates it to a matter of principle. Who else is listening? Well, Xi Jinping. And the Iranians. And the South Koreans, Japanese, Saudi Arabians, and more.Suppose, just suppose, China invades Taiwan. How does the same principle not apply? Goodbye strategic ambiguity. A no-fly zone would be a joke in that case -- if the U.S. wishes to save Taiwan it will mean attacks, not just loitering over Taiwan waiting for something to happen. How about responding with an embargo, a no-trade zone? Well, that would risk U.S. warships shooting at a Chinese ship, which would threaten a wider war. Off the table. We have just wrapped Taiwan up and delivered it to China. Message to Iran: test one nuclear weapon. Invade Syria, Iraq, or whatever. The US will not respond. Message to others. Get nukes. Now. This war isn t just about Ukraine. It is about the kind of world we live in for the next generation. Why make these public pronouncements about what we will not do?

But we do not as a matter of principle rule out any action. ***Update:Of course the swiftness and severity of economic sanctions are big news of the last few weeks. How will Xi Jinping read that? I note that much of what s going on now are private, voluntary sanctions; a general refusal to do business with Russia because so many people and corporations are rightly outraged about this invasion.  Now, what will happen if China invades Taiwan? Will people around the world see the same outrage? Even the US officially regards China and Taiwan as one country. Will they be willing to do without the much larger and more crucial amount of Chinese manufactured goods? For how long?  These comments are not aimed at Russia. They are aimed at the local population, who are no longer treated as citizens, but a constituency to be pacified and shielded from any disturbing truths.I would hardly call it  pacifying  to communicate clearly to our soldiers (many of whom, including some of my neighbors, have already had their Eastern European deployments extended indefinitely) that the U.S. does not plan on becoming involved in direct military conflict with Russia, e.g. a no-fly-zone. I m not claiming that s the wisest strategy, and as it happens, I agree with John that this is a circumstance where ambiguity is likely superior.  But given this decision, why rule it out? Why say it out loud? Why make it a matter of principle, now a doctrine? Let s not be cavalier about these decisions: there are thousands of military families out there who would be much more anxious right now if Biden were less ambiguous. John, that s one reason why. Is it enough? Probably not, in my opinion. But it isn t nothing. And it s just my nearly-worthless strategic decision.I appreciate your concern, but the military is expected to operate under ambiguity, which should obviate your argument against leaving the NFZ on the table. While military families might complain about their concerns, they re neither a large nor concentrated constituency to matter in that regard, and the all-volunteer force is free to end their service at the end of every contract. Anxiety is par for the course for military families, and the successful ones learn to live with the uncertainty.How will the market react to news that escalates the war or even keeps it ambiguous? poorly. Haven t they done enough to us the last few years? To be clear, I mean the university intellectual class and politicians and their ridiculous lockdowns. How about we sit this one out so we can afford to save for your generation s very expensive retirement, and maybe even start families of our own. Old grumpy boomers can still indoctrinate the next generation from cozy armchairs in the 2030s, for now, they need to admit they messed up (even if tacitly like Biden is doing) and need to begin accepting their retirement from the world stage.This administration is short its Henry Kissinger in these negotiations. I fear that all these digital world people do not understand that the analog world is not the same as their digital models. In the analog world, your adversary gets a say, too. In terms of Taiwan: it does seem as though the same principle would apply. Therefore the issue would seem to be for the US and other countries to decide *beforehand* whether they are going to support Taiwan and if so have an official presence there so it would be *China* that risks stepping over the line to incite war with a nuclear power (or powers) and that may prevent it from doing so. It seems your frustration is that you d like to be able to see them continue their waffling and be able to be drawn into it at a later date if needed without being blamed for stepping in and perhaps triggering a nuclear war. You acknowledge that despite thinking  MAD was always questionable game theory.   you imply its good that  But at least the rules of the game were clear . So its odd that you are puzzled about the idea of at least partial clarity this time regarding the rules (even if not complete clarity):  Why say it out loud?... They could simply not do it, and keep Putin guessing.  Unfortunately the rules Putin will follow aren t clear. Its not clear whether he will view sanctions that are too harsh or the provision of weapons as a justification for attacking NATO and broadening the war. However its seems clear that any direct conflict like a no-fly zone has always been considered actual involvement in a war so it makes sense to avoid that. I suspect if Nato had troops in Ukraine or Ukraine was part of Nato that this war wouldn t have happened: but frustrated regret in hindsight of what you d have liked to see doesn t justify increasing the risk of nuclear conflict now. I think you miss the entire point of this administration. Your assumption that they actually care about the same things you care about is based on the false premise. Just as one example, an administration that would seek to buy oil from Iran and Venezuela, suppress domestic production, voice opposition to the East Med pipeline that would supply Greece and Cyprus with Israeli Natural gas is not an administration that cares about promoting the economic and strategic health of America and its democratic allies either now or in the future. If one looks at the refusal to change course on these suicidal energy and environmental policies I can not see how one could come to any other conclusion. No one can be that naïve or incompetent. Damage was caused by some of the reckless statements of the previous administration but this damage may be irreparable.I disagree with the deterrence logic from China s perspective. If the U.S. had said  maybe we will fight for Ukraine, maybe we won t , then didn t fight, that would encourage China. Saying outright  we won t fight in Ukraine  still preserves the strategic ambiguity in Taiwan.100%, surprise that we do not have more people seeing that fact, this is not about Ukraine, it is about normal world Vs world in which dictators do what they want... by not getting involved out of fear we virtually guarantee future nuclear war.. Fear is gasoline for dictators, it is drug like drug, sex and everything else.. fear fuels them... Your point on China is a good one and says something deeper about sanctions. A sanction is not a one-way street. The  sanctioner  suffers as does the  sanctionee . If the sanctioner is large with many other alternative trading partners and the sanctionee is small then sanctions can work - to a degree. When the sanctionee is your largest trading partner and a large holder of your country s debt the notion that sanctions are viable is silly on its face. If the US even mentioned sanctions in the case of China, Xi Jingping should just laugh out loud and invite them. Oh - OK, in that case we would like to redeem rather than roll over all the debt we are holding - ok? How would that be for a  sanction ?There is a major global doctrine that should be questioned: the idea that its a war crime to assassinate heads of state like Putin. Admittedly its unlikely to be claimed: but you still have to wonder how many $billions the Ukraine government could raise from global contributors as a bounty for Putin s head in hopes it might turn insiders against him. There are innocent people suffering in the Ukraine, and now collateral economic damage to innocent by standards in Russia and around the world since sanctions hurt both sides. @Anonymous:Where is that written? Yamamoto? One source talking about the general issue and mentioning US prohibitions on it:https://lieber.westpoint.edu/assassination-law-of-war/ ASSASSINATION IN THE LAW OF WAR... In 1977, following revelations of U.S. lethal targeting operations and ensuing Church (Senate) and the Pike (House) Committee hearings, President Gerald Ford issued Executive Order 11,905. The order prohibited Executive Branch personnel from engaging in, or conspiring to engage in, political assassination. Subsequent administrations continued the ban. Four years later, President Regan issued Executive Order 12,333, which, as amended, remains in effect today. It contains the same prohibition, although it limits application to individuals “acting on behalf of” the U.S. government. The only purpose in declaring a  no-fly zone  over the Ukraine is to destroy the aggressor s assets on the ground. At present, the Russian Federation does not control Ukrainian air-space -- it, the air-space, is still contested by the Russians and the Ukrainians. Given that the Ukraine is nearer Russia than it is nearer the U.S., maintaining a  no-fly  zone against Russian air force planes over the Ukraine is logistically challenging--the U.S. air force assets in range are based in the EU and the UK at present. To avoid entangling the EU in the proposed  no-fly  zone, USAF assets would have to re-base in the Ukraine, and this is not practicable.The purpose of the announcement by the U.S. is to assure the European members of NATO that the war will not be brought home to them by USAF assets returning from bombing runs in the Ukraine. Private assurances are not enough.And, it matters not one whit whether the announcement is made privately (in the ears of the European heads of government) or publicly---the position will be known, virtually instantly, in the Kremlin.Game this out for yourself. You re president of the U.S., and your opponent is V. V. Putin, president of the Russian Federation. Your assets are dispersed, not concentrated; his are dispersed and concentrated. You have B-22 bombers; he has SAMs and hypersonic cruise missiles. He has much to gain by subjugating the Ukraine; you have very little to gain by preventing that subjugation. He has little to lose if he fails to overrun the Ukraine; you have much to lose if the war widens and deepens to involve all of Europe, the UK, and eventually North America. The trade analysis needs to be made in a state of sang-froid, not the hot-blooded heat of the moment.I mentioned earlier that the population of the Ukraine is 42 millions, and the adult population between the ages of 18 yrs. and 60 yrs. is roughly 10 millions, and if 10% of those 10 millions will serve in the army to repulse the aggressor, the Ukraine could field 1 million fighters. What is lacking is armaments--small arms and anti-tank weaponry. Given the armaments etc. the man-power ratio would then be 5-to-1 in favour of the Ukrainians. The road from Poland is still open. Make use of it, before you stagger/blunder into a fight that will lead to a wider and longer confrontation with Russia, and possibly China/N. Korea. As president of the United States of America, your first responsibility is to the United States of America, and to fill that role you must harden your heart and engage your brain. The Ukraine must do this for itself. This is their  trial by fire , just as the Revolutionary War and the Civil War were the U.S. s own  trial by fire  struggles. It s worth mentioning that the Soviet Union (when it still existed) spent over 9 years (1979-1989) trying to subjugate the Afghans. And that it is when the Soviets were at the height of their economic and political power.For context, the US Revolutionary War was 7 years long and the US Civil War was 4 years long.I don t see this war going on more than two years with continued worldwide economic sanctions against Russia. The Ruble will become worthless, Russia will be cut off from most (all?) economic markets, and I doubt Putin will live that long.It is idle to speculate on the duration of a conflict such as the Russian Federation s invasion of the Ukraine. The aggressor has specific objectives that he seeks to attain. The defender, likewise, has specific objectives he must realize to remain independent. While the conflict rages and broadens across the Ukraine, the window for compromise becomes narrower and narrower, but the prospects of resolution by the parties increase. When will the conflict end? This year, not later than June or July, if that long.The RUR is freely floating and transactions in the RUR comprise but 1.1% of international transactions. The value of the RUR will be largely tempered by the dependency of the world on commodity exports from both the Russia Federation and the Ukraine.Sanctions will curtail Russian exports somewhat, but as you can plainly see in the case of petroleum and natural gas commodity exports, curtailment is problematical for the EU and europe as a whole. Even for the U.S., banning imports of oil from Russia poses some problems (drives petroleum fuel prices higher). For non-energy commodities, it is notable that both Russia and the Ukraine are exporters of small grains which find demand in the Middle East, and in Africa which is especially dependent on those export sources for much of their imports of foodstuffs. For metals, Russia is a significant source of nickel and aluminum and copper--metals that are used in the fabrication of EV components, for example. Disruption of the flow of any or all of those commodities (energy, food, and metals) is problematic for international trade and global economic growth. Sanctioning food exports from Russia is fraught with collateral problems (destablizing Africa for example). When one considers the source of processed rare-earth elements and the basic commodities, the western countries are not today uniquely endowed or in a position to maintain such sanctions over the long run. Ergo, sanctions are more of a political P.R. issue than a  lever  to be used to bring the conflict to an end. That is especially the case in the U.K. and in Canada today.Count on V. V. Putin being around and in power for quite a bit longer than any of the current roster of democratically elected officials leading the western powers will be. The Fates are fickle that way. MAD was always questionable game theory. If Russia blows up a city in Europe, why would NATO murder tens of millions of Russian civilians in response? Why not? There was no certainty. That s enough. Nobody wanted to accept the risk.Yes, nuclear powers don t fight directly with each other. Yes, everybody get nukes.Ukraine might have been settled by 2014. We will not know. Looks like the chance is gone, and it s not worth a war to fix it.Only current hope is the unexpected incompetence of Russian forces.The word murder does a lot of work in that quote. The answer is not retaliating is surrendering. Tit for Tat is a superior strategy for inducing cooperation. Surrender just invites abuse. Weakness is provocative.  Tit for Tat is a superior strategy for inducing cooperation That s probably true if you are playing a repeating game with multiple rounds. If you are playing the game only once I don t see the superiority of the strategy. Surrender is a superior one in any count (a much more desirable end game ... literally!!)@El emperador desnudo:“You were given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor and you will have war.”Churchill @Fat manA conventional war is a complete different animal. We were talking about MAD, and stragegy that works until it does not.I suppose that s right in the context of a game and threats. But I find US moves very disturbing. Mutual deterrence, another game, works by equivalent threats of execution. Nuclear arms in Ukraine shortens the time to strike Russia. In the same way, that Russian missiles in Cuba threatened US first strike capability. Second, we re now talking about arming Ukrainian civilians, after making clear we re not going to do anything. Not a good thing to set up untrained civilians to fight/die for a superpower s geopolitical interests, especially when it s not fighting for them, or doesn t have that strong an interest. US led Ukraine down the garden path, then dumped them. And 3rd, there are ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine that didn t agree to the government installed after the 2014 coup.Everybody in Washington thinks in binaries. You are all in or all out. There are lots of other possibilities. How about  leasing  some UAVs to Ukraine and painting them Blue and yellow. Some of them can carry missiles. Those missiles may not be able to take out a tank, but taking out a food truck or a fuel truck might be just as good at this stage. If one of them is shot down, there is no pilot for the Russians to torture. Work on the assumption that this is not an idea that has crossed the mind of anyone in the Administration whose job requires Senate Confirmation.Where is the push from the US or the EU or the  International Community  to resolve this conflict? Instead, all the parties who would normally be trying to calm things down are pumping up the violence.It is clear that Russia does not want to occupy the Ukraine. All they want is to make sure that NATO (i.e. US) does not plant offensive weapons on their border. Given how JFK responded to the Cuban situation, Russia s stated aims seem quite reasonable.Why are we not seeing any diplomatic effort to (1) assure Russia that the Ukraine will never be part of NATO, and (2) assure the Ukraine that it can achieve the happy prosperous situation of Finland? Does the lack of a constructive US   Western response have anything to do with the well-established corruption in the Ukraine that reached even to Biden s family?This is not to defend Russia s invasion of the Ukraine. But we need to ask ourselves -- what other options did  Our Guys  give Russia when they repeatedly ignored clearly stated Russian concerns?ExactlyYou re putting too much stock in the premise that other countries believe the US consistently uses force according to set norms or  rules . It s hard to imagine any country taking these no-fly statements as  doctrine  given the chaotic record of US armed forces  interventions. Obtaining nukes has been a goal for Iran and others for decades for their obvious leverage, I have no idea why this changes anything.John, you will never make it as a diplomat or military strategist. You have taken the President at his word. Didn’t he also say he would not invoke SWIFT sanctions?...or a ban on Russian oil/gas? And now he says “nothing is off the table” with regard to a ban on oil/gas. It is all part of his strategic ambiguity; clarity is not to be forthcoming and does not serve our interest. Putin plays chess; Biden plays poker. – What is your next move? What is your next bidding? Let’s go tit-for-tat up that escalation ladder.I think the object is to draw out the war for weeks and months. The longer it goes, the more Putin’s hand is weakened. In a possible confrontation between two nuclear powers, there is no need for America to rachet up the escalation in only the third week of the conflict. We will go step-by-step; we and our NATO partners have a lot more cards to play. Ukrainians have a long struggle ahead of them. Their liberty will be seared in blood, and it will be their sacrifice that proves victorious, and not NATO or America winning the fight for them. Did the French win our Revolution? [Next to our Civil War, the American Revolution was our bloodiest.]You are getting out of your lane again; your economic comments are interesting; your poly sci not so much.How are Blinken s comments about Ukraine the equivalent of a doctrine. They are statements about the level of intervention in Ukraine now.They say nothing about Taiwan other than that which is already known: we would rather not be involved but might in certain circumstances. Even in Ukraine if Russia used tactical nukes, they can have no confidence in what NATO would do even though Ukraine is not a member. The fact US Senators are even advocating for a NFZ in Ukraine now for the first time is evidence that US determination to stay out could chsnge. They are making a judgement that Ukraine can survive without it, and that the extra death and destruction in Ukraine is not worth the risk There is no way of sustaining this judgement from a utilitarian or moral perspective without sustaining that the destruction of Poland or even the US is not worth the riskYou certainly could think that the lives of Ukrainian civilians that are going to be lost in Ukraine are worth less that the lives that could be lost in a nuclear conflict times the risks of the conflict escalating to a nuclear war. And you can arrive at the same position using moral judgement.Now, in the original statement, you change  Ukrainian civilians  for  Polish civilians  or, even, for  American civilians  and nothing should change in your utilitarian calculations (or in your  moral  judgement). So, your conclusion should still be, that saving those Polish or American lives by stablishing a no-fly zone is not worth risking a full nuclear war.The only way of justifying engaging Russia to avoid Polish or American casualties but not engaging Russia to avoid Ukrainian casualties on moral or utilitarian grounds is by placing a higher value in an American or Polish civilian life than in a Ukrainian one.I find this proposition very difficult to defend from both a moral and a utilitarian perspective.Well, if NATO introduces a no-fly zone and starts shooting down Russian jets, then Russia will be shooting down NATO planes and hitting NATO airports (presumably in Poland and Romania). What s next? I guess next we will read a John s blog post asking  Why rule out nuking Moscow? . John, you need to treat all lives -- Americans, Ukrainians (including those who live in Donbass), Russians, Iraqis, Libyans, Afghans, etc -- equally. Basic concepts: 10 lives lost are 10 time more pain and horror than 1 live lost (no matter what the nationalities are), lives of children and women are far more valuable than lives of men, and so on. Hope you do not believe that there are people who are more equal than other people.How sane. Thank you. I would like to see same equal treatment or judiciousness with sanctions. Syrian friends suffering from US sanctions, freezing with 1 hour on/5 hours off electricity. A Russian friend from grad school whose STEM papers are now rejected bc of Ukraine. The sanctions fallout - madness of firing/deleting artists: Anna Netrebko, Gergieve, Dostoevsky, Tschaikovsky... Minor disagreement: Syria invited both Iran and Russia, did not invite US who established base at al Tanf, confiscated oil fields,elsewhere in NE SyriaIf Putin believes the US will impose a no-fly zone and that this will lead to escalation, then Putin might not want to wait until the NFZ is imposed but may instead choose to escalate right now in response to what the US is already doing: sharing intelligence and weapons with Ukraine. If there s such a thing as pre-escalation, declaring the no-fly zone off the table could prevent it.It seems there is a supply/demand partial solution to Russia s aggression. I suspect declining oil prices, now highly inelastic, would make Russia less bellicose. The Soviet economy cratered when oil declined from $75 bbl in 1980 to $22 bbl in 1986. By 1989 when the Soviets left Afghanistan, crude oil averaged about $19 bbl. They were bankrupt. According to the WSJ, 7% of our oil imports come from Russia. Why not increase domestic production so as to lower oil equilibrium prices. NATO and the US cannot and should not enforce a no-fly zone. Blinken as well as NATO stating that is simply common sense, both for NATO servicemen and women as well as to avoid wrong expectations. From a country that invaded other countries without any justification ( weapons-of-mass destruction  anybody?). Decisions about war are rarely about morals obviously (Saddam used to be an esteemed ally of the US as long as his ire was directed at Iran). Back of the envelope strategists can bring their vast experience in nuclear warfare to bear extending beyond Mutually-Assured-Destruction, which I just learned has not worked (because ???).  Message to Iran: test one nuclear weapon. Invade Syria, Iraq, or whatever. The US will not respond. This literally happened and the Obama administration did nothing and most everyone was on board. Except it wasn t just Iran that invaded Syria and threw money and weapons and soldiers there, it was also Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Bahrain. All the while these states had plausible deniability but anyone that says they were not involved in the conflict does not deserve to have their opinion taken seriously.I m kind of looking at everything everyone is doing to Russia right now and wondering  we do this to the entire Middle East in 2015, is the Syrian War over in a week? Hello Professor John Cochrane. Completely wrong analysis. You seem to think that instead of announcing it publicly that U.S. will not enter into direct conflict with Russia, Biden administration should have privately communicated it to Putin. Have you considered the situation that the Biden administration would not be able to deliver on its private assurances, because of rapid geopolitical developments as well as capriciousness of public opinion in reaction to them. This is what a democracy looks like. The days of Dr. Strangelove or John Von Neumann suggesting nuclear strategies based on game theory are long over. So called geniuses doing dumb things. Best approach is to use democratic means to convince both sides -- Ukraine and Russia -- that there is plenty of upside in giving up the war.A principal of negotiation is to not make concessions for free.That said, from what I ve heard from subject area experts, an enforceable no fly zone is not practical. I don t think people are seriously considering this, but a no fly zone is a de facto declaration of war... an enforceable no fly zone is a commitment to a kinetic military engagement with Russian forces.  -- Stanford s Michael Kofmanhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4uHZPFuI1o t=2584sIn that talk, Ward Carroll of the US Naval Institute also makes the point that combat air patrols above Ukraine would be in range of the S400 SAM sites that ring the western border of Russia. Those could be soft killed (whatever that means?), but  the one thing that would be an act of war, if your SAMs are getting soft killed and your only response is now air to air warfare, now you re going to get one of your airplanes shot down and then your next move is to declare war on whatever country it was or NATO...  He continues,  ... it [a no fly zone] is just not practical, and I don t think we re going to have a UN resolution, because you need that, and you need local air superiority to do it, and we don t have either of those things at this point. I’m surprised at the shallowness of your concept of the geopolitical situation with respect to China. The Chinese and Xi aren’t like Putin and his quack cronies. Their understanding of the geopolitical situation isn’t restricted to threat / no threat. They understand the subtleties of economics and appearances much more deeply than the Putin regime and no doubt have a more accurate concept of the relative strengths and weaknesses of their military position. They surely recognize that, in the eyes of the US, Ukraine and Taiwan aren’t remotely comparable. The US has *very* strong historical ties across the Pacific - Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Korea, Viet Nam, Australia, numerous small island nations - and none in Ukraine. The US would be stupid to tie down assets and resources in Ukraine that could otherwise protect Taiwan. China understands that. China would *rather* the US get wrapped up in Ukraine and leave Taiwan exposed. Europe and the US should already be thinking globally. Europe has by far the most substantial strategic interest in protecting Ukraine and the geopolitical position to do so, so it should be Europe that carries the load on Ukraine. In this sense China and/or Russia might recognize that NATO is in some respects a ball and chain for Europe. While the US can act independently in the Pacific, NATO action in Europe must be restricted because it would draw the US into the conflict. But at this point Europe has no prepared means to act as a unit independent of NATO, so there is little chance of a direct military response. I ve determined you know nothing of how the FED works, (from an earlier article) now I know that you know nothing of how the world works. Seems to me you re an over educated leftist (you probably voted for that senile old grifter who currently pretends to occupy the oval office)and in these times when leftist want to destroy the U.S. that sure makes you a traitor. What do we do with traitors during a time of war???MAD is questionable. Of course. But remember, if you make a mistake, if your rational calculus is mistaken, then it is the end. So, please consider nuclear strategy seriously and take a pessimistic outlook. Any NATO intervention and we could be in this nightmare.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

Nonetheless, in doing so they recognize the problem. They, or their successors, may follow with effective strategies. You lost me at the  free  trade and open borders. The Chinese have used  free  trade to steal our intellectual capital and gut our manufacturing. All we have gotten in return is crappy cell phones and the plague. Every cent we made off of  free  trade has been burned to deal with the plague. It wasn t worth it. Free  trade was a great idea for the UK when Britannia ruled the wave and the sun never set on the British Empire, and for the US in the aftermath of the Cold War. But now the world has gotten real again. It is the world of Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Hobbes.Trade is now a tool of foreign policy not part of economic policy. I do think we should remove all trade barriers with those of our allies that are democratic and committed to the rule of law. To me USMCA does not go far enough, and we should have similar agreements with Japan, Australia, the UK and other NATO countries.I would rather be a poor man standing on my own two feet, than a rich man on my knees kowtowing to Xi Jinping.As for your open borders idea. It suffers from many of the same defects as  free  trade. Yes, we need more skilled labor. No, we don t need more illiterate peasants, MS 13 members, drug dealers, or welfare drones. We also need to ensure that every able bodied American citizen has a good job at a living wage. We don t need to import workers so Hollywood executives have cheap nannies and gardeners.The  free  trade open borders economy has made a lot of money for urban elites who profit from investments in China and benefit from cheap domestic servants. It has devastated wide swaths of the country with joblessness, drug addiction, and hopelessness. And, it has poisoned our political and social dialog. Despite all the miracles of modern medicine life expectancies have gone down amongst the excluded classes.This is the real crisis that our idiot leftists want to label as the distribution of wealth. Piketty, like most Frenchmen is recycling the slogans of the Jacobins, 200 years after they lost all relevance. Joel Kotkin is an analyst who has a much better understanding of the nature of the crisis. Good post by John, good rejoinder from Fat Man. A great deal of the two posts is also applicable to Australia, although things aren t as bad here, they are still moving in the wrong direction. I agree with much of  Fat Man s Comment. The US must have the most counterproductive immigration policy in the world. We now have open borders that has allowed 2 million unvetted and unvaccinated illegal aliens into the country along with huge amounts of contraband. Meanwhile we send home Indian Engineers with advanced degrees unless they can win the visa lottery. Allowing a controlled flow of unskilled immigrants is fine to fill the jobs cited by Cochrane. But the current policy is a disaster. Think about the cost that will be incurred by local governments for years to come. On free trade, I could not care less if the US no longer produces low end cheap manufactured products but to cede our expertise in high end manufacturing to the mercantilist CCP is no longer tenable. Some of the problem can be attributed to onerous environmental and other regs that discourages production of rare earth metals and other critical inputs and which can be rectified by reform. It is a difficult path to get it right and industrial policy always becomes political and results in massive misallocation of resources. Somehow a middle path needs to be found that balances free trade efficiencies with national security priorities as we face implacable adversaries in China and Russia.It is often forgotten that the benefits from a move to freer trade are net benefits. There are winners and there are losers, with the winners winning more than the losers lose. That doesn t make the losers happy.Compensate the losers. @Alan K wrote:  I could not care less if the US no longer produces low end cheap manufactured products but to cede our expertise in high end manufacturing to the mercantilist CCP is no longer tenable. I should begin by thanking him for his endorsement. He recognizes that some simple things such as mining rare earths have been shut down by regulatory actions. But, I think the issues are bigger and more complicated than just giving out permits. I think that the following excerpt points out that high end vs low end does not capture the complexity of the problem: So let s talk a bit about the synthesis of Paxlovid (PF-07321332), Pfizer s protease inhibitor drug for the coronavirus. ... Small-molecule drugs are wonderful things ... but they have logistic complications of their own. Let s list some: ... That multistep work means that there are a huge variety of reagents that can be involved in such syntheses, and every new drug arrives with its own list. ... this is one of the absolutely more important parts of drug production on scale: what reagents do you need, how much, and where are you going to get them? What steps of the process are going to be done where, and by whom, and for how much money? A given drug (or its constituents) can go through two, three, half a dozen facilities in completely different countries during this work ... ... if you track almost any drug s production down to the earliest stages, you will almost invariably come to a whole bunch of offshore suppliers. These are mostly Chinese, although there are some Indian ones and other countries in the mix as well. What they tend to have in common are lower labor and capital costs and a higher tolerance for the presence of a large number of smelly, unattractive, and sometimes downright dangerous chemical production facilities. We simply do not have a lot of that capability here in the US any more; it s been declining for decades because it s so much cheaper to have someone else do it. ...  Making Paxlovid  By Derek Lowe • 5 Jan 2022 • https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/making-paxlovid • Derek Lowe has a PhD in organic chemistry and has worked for several major pharmaceutical companies. He writes a blog:  In the Pipeline , which is hosted on the Science Magazine website. I highly recommend it. I have learned from it a great deal about the biological science behind the plague and its treatments.The implications of this situation for national security are frightening. How can we fight a war against a country that can cut off our supplies of medicines? If the Chinese Communists take over Taiwan and cut off the supply of computer chips that run our military equipment how will we resist them?I do not claim that every step of every process must be inside the the US. Some things can be in Central and South America, and others in South or Southeast Asia. But no strategic supply chain should be allowed to go through the China/Russia Axis of Evil. We need the most searching inquiry into all of our supply chains and a policy of protecting ourselves from their vulnerabilities. Trade policy must become the servant of Foreign and Security policy.I see the immigration issue as fairly straightforward: we need more legal skill-based immigration, and less illegal immigration. It s shocking our political class cannot come to this compromise.I might go a step further and disallow immigrants access to our social benefits system for some period of time. This will reduce any misplaced incentives for people to come.Across the spectrum, there are so many win-win compromises that can t be reached because politics is broken. It s a big issue.Really, the private sector would build millions of new housing units along the West Coast if allowed. Much needed.I suspect some sort of federal bonuses for areas that move un-zoned property is needed. Tried that. A lot of them caught fire and were burned to the ground with the green left blaming  global warming .This comment has been removed by the author.https://news.yahoo.com/russian-businessman-places-1m-bounty-231620021.htmlHas the crowd funding site been set up yet?

BiologyFree trade critically relies on the assumption that everyone plays by the rules and no one cheats. That assumption does not hold with China, which cheats and steals at every opportunity. Therefore, we cannot have free trade as long as China--or communist China, at least--is in existence. And firms in the West do not know this, do not put it into their prices, and are otherwise throwing money away, acting like charities.John, you state:  But since 2000, that post-war growth rate has fallen almost by half, to 1.4% per year. And it’s worse in Canada and Europe, where many countries have not grown at all since 2010 on a per capita basis. The following chart from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis  FRED database does not indicate support for your statement (quote above): https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=MDXO .The traces shown in the chart are:Red -- Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure in Constant Prices: Total Gross Domestic Product for Canada/Population, Total for Canada;Green -- Real Gross Domestic Product/Population, Total for United StatesThe abscissa is calendar time spanning from 1962 through 2020 (time increments are annual, end of period). The ordinate is displayed in percentage change year-to-year.There is no significant difference evident between the growth rates of real GDP/capita of the two national series. The traces indicate that the correlation between the two countries is strongly positive. The trend lines in both countries are essentially of the same in magnitude and direction.From this data, the null hypothesis, Ho: there is no difference between the two time series is unlikely to be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, H1: per capita real GDP growth in Canada is worst than per capita real GDP growth in the United States.What is your position on unions in general? Should they be regulated? How?I read your article dated may 12,2020 titled  How the Fed Plans to Pay the Country s Bills  and I have a question... at one point you say the banks can by  flipping an electronic switch. Banks can convert reserves to cash and back at will.  That s not how I understand fed created reserves(money supposedly created when the FED buys treasuries from a primary dealer.)My understanding is those reserves must remain within the FED system, never to be converted to cash. So, what s the real answer... are banks allowed to convert FED created reserves to cash for the purpose of lending?Reserves held at the Federal Reserve Banks can be exchanged for currency at any time when the Federal Reserve Bank in the commercial bank s city or state is open for business. The currency so obtained becomes a  vault reserve , i.e., a reserve held on the premises of the commercial bank. Currency can be exchanged for reserves at the FRB in a reverse transaction. Handling the currency, however, requires physically transporting the currency to/from the FRB from/to the commercial bank s vaults, a costly process usually undertaken for the convenience of the bank s depositors (e.g., individuals and retail businesses that transact in the physical currency).I specified FED created reserves, ie, the FED  buys  treasury debt and credits the selling banks reserve account.I believe those reserves must remain in the system to be swapped when the FED returns the treasuries. Hence, no new money is created. Do you want to change your answer? So, what s the real answer... are banks allowed to convert FED created reserves to cash for the purpose of lending? Sure, by buying back the Treasuries from the Fed and then selling them in the open market (two step process). Really!!! So the real answer is NO. Reserves remain with the FED system and cannot be converted to cash. Only when reserves are no longer reserves can the bank use that cash to  print out of thin air   loans. There, fixed it for you.Mark,You are forgetting something. The Fed pays interest on reserves. Those interest payments can be lent back out. Principle can t be touched as long as it is held in reserve, interest payments can.Interest was never the question. The statement I objected to was that banks have an electronic switch to turn reserves into cash. Clearly, they do not... only when they are no longer reserves can they serve as basis for  lending.  Are you forgetting that those treasuries payed interest??? Are you claiming the FED pays more interest than those banks would receive from the Bonds??? So, NO. No new money is created. Period.No, Mark, I have no intention of changing my comments that appear above. The description of the process of converting FRB reserves to  cash  is correct as stated.John Cochrane s remark is famously opaque and I interpret it to be  throw-away comment  and not one to be accorded any weight whatsoever.In a fractional banking system, the commercial banks regulated by the FRB Board of Governors (delegated) hold reserves in many forms, including but not limited to the banks  accounts with the Federal Reserve Banks around the country.Where does  new money  come from? (1) Commercial bank loans to private borrowers (persons, corporations, municipalities, state and other local governments); and, (2) FOMC quantitative easing ( QE ) programs. In case (2)  base money  is created when the FOMC purchases securities to hold to maturity through the committee s open-market activities. In case (1) M2 increases. In case (2) base money increases, which in turn increases M2. In both cases the money supply increases. If the FOMC decides to sell its holdings of financial assets, then the base money supply would contract, and M2 would likewise contract. A commercial bank that holds a balance with the FRB-NY in excess of its calculated reserve requirements needed to clear its liabilities in the payments system, will rid itself of the excess balance by making loans to other banks, brokers, industrials, and non-financial corporations at various terms to maturity. One might suppose that this is basis of John Cochrane s puzzling remark. And, I tend to think that that is what he was referring to.Can you be for infinite growth on a finite planet, stereotypical economist and still be taken seriously? We seem to be coming to the end of the fossil fuel splurge but even should  a miracle occur with more energy supply the oceans will boil with a few centuries of compound rate of growth. See the Dothemath.com website.Jim and Linda,First, a lot of economic growth comes from new inventions - black and white TV replaces radio, color TV replaces black and white, motorized vehicle replaces horse and buggy etc. Growth is only limited by our own imagination.Second, look beyond this planet. There is a whole universe out there begging to be explored. Men and women have climbed the highest mountain and explored the deepest oceans on this planet.First, the oceans will never  boil  -- surprised some still believe that nonsense. Second, only on  star trek.  We will make do with what we have on this planet, and we will do quite well because evolution is still progressing.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

		<title>The U.S. and NATO must fight</title>
		<description> p style= text-align: center;   b The U.S. and NATO must fight /b  /p  p (Coauthored with Elizabeth Fama) /p  p Why are we — the U.S., NATO, the civilized western world — not fighting for Ukraine? If we do not fight in Ukraine now, we will fight there later, or in the Baltics, Poland, or Taiwan, at much greater cost. If we do not forcefully reverse this invasion, larger ones will follow. /p  p The next few days and weeks are vital. If the government of Ukraine falls, President Zelenskyy and other leaders of the legitimate government will be jailed or murdered. Russia will annex Ukraine, or install a puppet government with a defense treaty. It will declare Ukraine under the Russian nuclear umbrella. Freeing Ukraine after the fact, re-creating a government, will be much harder and riskier. /p  p Sanctions will not save Ukraine. Sanctions were intended as a deterrent. Sanctions are a punishment. Sanctions are not an effective way to fight a war. They will do little to stop Russia from winning in the next month or two. Sanctions will not achieve what must be our goal: Russian withdrawal, Ukrainian sovereignty, a return to the borders we pledged to uphold in 1994. Cuba, Iran, and North Korea withstood sanctions for decades. So will Russia. nbsp; /p  p Now that sanctions have failed to deter Putin, what is the plan? On the current course, if we don’t provide more help, Ukraine loses, the country is destroyed or partitioned, and we settle in for decades of deciding just how much energy Russia sells to Europe, what Europe sells in return, and how much tut-tutting we do about Russia trading with China, Iran, and others. While Putin turns his roving eye to the Baltics. /p  p To save Ukraine, to save its democratically elected government, to save its people, to stop this from happening over and over, allies must  nbsp;fight. /p  p We have the means. Russia does not have the power of the old Soviet Union, or of Nazi Germany. Russia spends $62 billion a year on its military. The US spends $788 billion. Germany and France spend $53 each, and the U.K. $59. NATO as a whole spends about $1.2 trillion a year on defense, almost twenty times what Russia spends. Our armies are larger, better equipped, and better trained than Russia’s. We lack only the will. /p  p News from Ukraine already suggests unexpected Russian weakness: deficiencies in advanced weapons, tactics, training, supplies, and intelligence.

		<text>John Cochrane s blogThe U.S. and NATO must fight(Coauthored with Elizabeth Fama)Why are we — the U.S., NATO, the civilized western world — not fighting for Ukraine? If we do not fight in Ukraine now, we will fight there later, or in the Baltics, Poland, or Taiwan, at much greater cost. If we do not forcefully reverse this invasion, larger ones will follow.The next few days and weeks are vital. If the government of Ukraine falls, President Zelenskyy and other leaders of the legitimate government will be jailed or murdered. Russia will annex Ukraine, or install a puppet government with a defense treaty. It will declare Ukraine under the Russian nuclear umbrella. Freeing Ukraine after the fact, re-creating a government, will be much harder and riskier.Sanctions will not save Ukraine. Sanctions were intended as a deterrent. Sanctions are a punishment. Sanctions are not an effective way to fight a war. They will do little to stop Russia from winning in the next month or two. Sanctions will not achieve what must be our goal: Russian withdrawal, Ukrainian sovereignty, a return to the borders we pledged to uphold in 1994. Cuba, Iran, and North Korea withstood sanctions for decades. So will Russia. Now that sanctions have failed to deter Putin, what is the plan? On the current course, if we don’t provide more help, Ukraine loses, the country is destroyed or partitioned, and we settle in for decades of deciding just how much energy Russia sells to Europe, what Europe sells in return, and how much tut-tutting we do about Russia trading with China, Iran, and others. While Putin turns his roving eye to the Baltics.To save Ukraine, to save its democratically elected government, to save its people, to stop this from happening over and over, allies must  fight.We have the means. Russia does not have the power of the old Soviet Union, or of Nazi Germany. Russia spends $62 billion a year on its military. The US spends $788 billion. Germany and France spend $53 each, and the U.K. $59. NATO as a whole spends about $1.2 trillion a year on defense, almost twenty times what Russia spends. Our armies are larger, better equipped, and better trained than Russia’s. We lack only the will.News from Ukraine already suggests unexpected Russian weakness: deficiencies in advanced weapons, tactics, training, supplies, and intelligence. There is a good chance that Russia needs this to be over quickly. If this is true, it is all the more important for us to help Ukraine to hold on.What can be done in practical terms? NATO can immediately declare a Russian no-fly zone over Ukraine. Denying Russia the skies would critically hamper their invasion. NATO can launch missiles, drones, and airstrikes at Russian army assets. NATO should move invasion forces to the Ukrainian borders. Allies could work closely and directly with the Ukrainian Army, and support their intelligence. The U.S. could unleash our own cyber capabilities. We should protect President Zelenskyy and his government. (The man is a hero.)We cannot fight, many say, because any engagement of NATO and Russian forces could provoke a nuclear escalation.

Do what it takes, calibrate responses, sure, maybe we don t have the right strategy. Maybe big sanctions will do it. Maybe Putin will be overthrown, But letting  Ukraine lose and then settling in for a sanctions negotiation is an unacceptable outcome. Do not let Ukraine lose.  Why are we — the U.S., NATO, the civilized western world — not fighting for Ukraine? Maybe because one too many politicians (with war dog economists and media in tow) have lied about the pretext for the US going to war - see LBJ and the Gulf of Tonkin incident or how about George W. Bush and his weapons of mass destruction? We two are not habitual hawks. Weren t you the one asking for a war with China to justify investment in math and science education?I agree.A no-fly zone would require the US/NATO to shoot down Russian planes. Are you (Professor Cochrane) ready for this escalation?Our founding fathers discouraged foreign intervention/entanglements, and John Quincy Adam said we should not go abroad looking for monsters to destroy. We have more than enough problems in the US including a porous border, escalating violent crime, a tattered K-12 educational system, over $30 trillion in debt, and on and on. Plus, as FRestly aptly points out, we have been lied to one too many times (Vietnam, Iraq, COVID, Afghanistan (it was supposed to be a short war that was our longest war and then our exit was tragic) just to name a few).Why not pressure the Biden administration to open up pipelines, leases, permits, and encourage companies to drill for and create energy?If the US government can pay billions for weak/ineffective COVID vaccines, then surely the US can provide incentives for companies to drill for and create energy not only for the US but so the US can reap the windfall from providing energy for Europe, rather than Putin.Under President Trump the US was energy independent, and the US was the largest exporter of energy, so we can do it again and quickly.BTW, why is the US currently importing 20% of our energy from Russia? Stop this madness and windfall for Putin!US and NATO troops could not defeat Afghanistan.How can they defeat Russia?Russia has already demonstrated their incompetence. And there s an enormous difference between defense and invasion. Could not defeat Afghanistan ... in Afghanistan. That s an argument actually in favor of the ability of defeating Russia in UkraineJohn, I ve always enjoy your thoughts. What do you think of the  realist  position (Mearsheimer s position: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4) and how do you reconcile your thoughts with the tough facts they bring to bear?Before Mearsheimer was a realist, Hans Morgenthau was a realist. What they both lack is the moral foundation any society must rest upon in order to sustain itself. That created the undoing of communism in Russia because it got to the point where the people were not invested in their nation to the degree needed to compete with the West. The same will be true for China – material wealth will bring demands from the people for more political liberty. What will a communist political regime do then? We are not talking about abstract idealism. What do you think is going on in Ukraine right now? The same thing that went on in the East Bloc after communism fell.It is not for Russia, or Russians, to determine what Ukraine, or Ukrainians, should want. If the settlement of the Ukraine situation today were to result in Ukraine becoming neutral militarily but allowed to be democratic and join the EU and  lean  West (like Finland, Austria (especially in the  50s), Switzerland) would Putin accept this?I’m reading several news accounts this week, like Mearsheimer s view, of how the U.S. is to blame for Russia/Putin’s action with Ukraine. They say it started with the U.S. attempt to expand NATO when the Soviet Union collapsed. Oh really?As I recall almost thirty years ago – the mid-1990s – as we were dealing with a newly created Russia and the questioning if NATO was still needed, what shall we do with NATO? Some of the idealistic talk was that if a new free Russia could liberalize it could join with the rest of Europe economically and a cooperative military arrangement could be made that would work with NATO.This talk was not that all idealistic; it was acted on. While Russia was not ready to join the European Union (EU) economically, it was invited and did become a participating member of the G-7, making it the G-8 in 1997. With upgrades to its economy, it could be ready to join the EU.Of the former East Bloc of the Soviet Union, all of those countries started their application to the EU between 1993 and 1996 and got their membership after 2000. Russia never applied or started an initiative to join the EU. In 1999 the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland became members of NATO – none of them border on Russia proper; Poland borders on Kaliningrad which is part of Russia but separate from the main territory because it is wedged between Poland and Lithuania. So no NATO nation was on the Russian border when Putin came to power in August 1999 and became President of Russia in May 2000. The Baltic States and other nations on Russia’s border joined NATO 2004 and after.My point is this: Russia, in the mid-1990s, had two paths to follow. It could liberalize and join Western Europe, or it could remain as it has historically, an East European power. It choose the later, not the former; and when Putin came to power, he doubled down on this. Putin had an opportunity to truly revolutionize Russia’s outlook for the future; but choose otherwise. Germany had a similar opportunity after WWII in the 1950s – to take its traditional role of a Central European power, counter-balancing its interests East and West; or turn to the West and join in an alliance. Konrad Adenauer, the leader of West Germany in 1949, choose a new path for Germany’s future.Russia lost its G-8 membership when it invaded the Crimea in 2014. History has no subjunctive case. Here we are. Now what?I largely agree, though we need to be careful not to so unsettle Putin that he greatly expands the war out of desperation to hold onto power. I do want us to strike now, if we can, as supply lines are stretched and stressed and the Russians are apparently over a barrel. The prospect of watching Russians surrender and/or retreat by the thousands is certainly welcome, as long as we don t push a desperate leader too far.Russia cannot meaningfully compete with the West in the short, or long-run.NATO countries are thugs in a back alley and can only attack weak countries. Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan...These summarize my thoughts as well. It s a grim but inexorable conclusionThere s no need for the US to intervene. The balance of power doesn t shift appreciably in Russia s favor if it wins in Ukraine, and it should be clear by now that the blood price will be substantial. As for the next wars, assuming Russia even has the resources to fight them, Poland will offer even stronger resistance and be defended by Germany, Sweden and probably UK naval and air power. We can t let issues in Europe distract us from the main security theater in the Pacific, where the US needs to unite a disparate coalition of lesser powers against a far more powerful potential hegemon. You have been given the choice between war and dishonor. You have chosen dishonor, and you will have war!  - Winston Churchill to the English Parliament, 1938. After the English Parliament s 1938 appeasement in Czechoslovakia.Fascinating how history repeats itself and how short is our memory. You have been given the choice between war and dishonor. You have chosen dishonor, and you will have war!  - Winston Churchill to the English Parliament, 1938. After the English Parliament s 1938 appeasement in Czechoslovakia. Fascinating how history repeats itself and how short our memory is.Xi makes Putin look like Mr. Sissypants. But America s corporate, financial and media elites do business with China.Putin=Hitler, but Xi=Confucianism.There is no money in the U.S. budget for the war. The U.S. state can no longer maintain bridges and roads on its territory. I must add, I feel uncomfortable supporting war when I am passed the typical age of a soldier and have no children in the service or eligible for service. Sending someone else s kids to die in the name of justified liberty is still hard for me to do.I think one thing worth noting, is that President Putin is not necessarily in the correct state of mind. Thus, in some sense, if NATO chooses to conduct military operations in Ukraine, this may indeed trigger Russian to carry out nuclear missile launches. If one were to assume Putin were rational, this need not be such a concern. However, given the numerous intelligence officers who have stated their position on his state of mind, it may be better to avoid any kind of military involvement in Ukraine, but pledge military involvement if other NATO nations are militarily threatened by Russia.Yes, those who have closely observed an increasingly isolated Putin over the last two years fear that he will not act rationally if his standing is at stake.but what kind of an example would military intervention set for our own corrupt despots? there is a moral hazard here, we cannot let anyone involved in corruption on our side profit from our military actions. let the good name of the clinton family be as sullied among the corrupt as it is already among the honest. then we can at least know whether we are foaming at the mouths for war because we truly believe in it, or is it just because the  legitimate  government of Ukraine has spent a lot on donations to our political leaders...but I dont know...maybe I m just under the thrall of disinformation...maybe the Clintons and the Bidens and the Bush s are all swell people and only Putin is bad.Hi John Cochrane,Even though I agree that we should be doing more, we are sending special ops veteran volunteers and there are numerous countries sending their own volunteers as well. It might not be enough in your eyes, however, with how disorganized the Russians are (they aren t even following proper military communication standards) and how many of them do NOT actually want to fight nor have proper training/strategy in how to do so effectively......I actually think it s more likely we hold Ukraine than lose it. We still hold every major city and we even have Russians surrendering to turn around and fight alongside Ukrainians against Russians now.Does more still need to be done? Yes. However, there is also a lot that has already been done and continues to be done or at least considered. Cyber warfare is being considered by Biden already and an execution of such a strategy was suggested to him on a bigger scale than ever before.This comment has been removed by the author.A few of ideas:First: The US and the NATO countries have not yet implemented a truly sweeping set of sanctions. They must sanction all imports of oil   gas from Russia. Further, we must seize all properties in New York and London that are owned by Russians of any sort. The same goes for bank accounts and other investments. We need to impose the same sanctions on Russia and Russians as we imposed on Germany and Germans during WWII.Second: The bulk of Russian troops are low skill, very young, conscripts on short terms. https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/why-the-russians-are-struggling/ What would happen if we offered any Russian soldier who surrenders peaceably, €10,000 in cash, a clean set of civilian clothes, a visa and a work permit for, and a ticket to the NATO country of his choice. I will wager that we would get a surprising number of takers. We might pay an additional bonus to any officer who delivers a whole unit. We could also pay for any arms and ammo they surrender. €1,000,000 for an MBT would be cheap. Russian MBTs are over $2,500,000 new. Heck, offer €5,000,000. Still cheaper than blowing them up.Third: There are a lot of  contractors  who were employed in Afghanistan and Iraq. They have some very serious skills in the military arts. We could re-up them and subcontract them to the Ukrainian military. they could be in the fight fast.Fourth: Along those lines. How about a squadron of A-10 Warthogs. Lend-lease them to Ukraine. Find  contractors who know how to fly them. Send them to Ukraine. They can really mess up a formation of armored vehicles.John: These are free to all takers. if you like them please pass them along to H. R. McMaster. He could pass them on to his former colleagues who are still on active duty. An extension of my idea 2. We could easily justify paying a tank crew that surrenders an intact MBT peaceably, €1,000,000. The Russian MBTs are priced at €2,000,000+ new off the lot. Late model used vehicles are being sold at like new prices these days, so we could get our money back. Professor Cochrane, I agree with you. I have family in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. The city was attacked on the first night by Russian aircraft and on Saturday night by Russian tanks. The tank attack was successfully repulsed. However, I do not know how long the Ukrainian forces can hold out but I pray that they do. I had a Whatsapp message from my cousin in Mykolaiv a few hours ago saying simply  We will win!  My uncle is returning to Ukraine from Italy to join the fight. Even though I have family there, it is not the only reason why I support you. I support you because it is ultimately in the best interests of the US to defend democracy. My family in Ukraine is grateful to the US, the UK, the EU, Australia and Japan, and many others, for the assistance so far given but now is the time to do even more. I agree.Thanks for the interesting piece. Re  a return to the borders we pledged to uphold in 1994 , I am a bit confused - my reading of the Budapest memorandum (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances#Content) is that the signatories pledged to respect the existing borders, and defend Ukraine in the event of a nuclear attack; but did not commit to defend those borders in the event of an invasion. Can you help me understand if I am missing something?John, You ve said exactly what I ve been thinking. Especially when I see that 40 mile long traffic jam of Russian tanks and armored vehicles. But in conversations I get no support. Everyone is afraid of being at war with Russia And you use an  Anonymous  name because?Remember the  Flying Tigers ? (American volunteers assisting China when Japan s army invaded).Imagine a rogue group of A10 s savaging that 40 mile column.In 2010, the people of Ukraine elected Viktor Yanukovych as President of the Ukraine. In 2014, he was violently ousted from power, leading supporters of that government were killed or imprisoned, and are still imprisoned to this day. Pro-Russia news media and Internet social sites were shut down by the force of the government. Cochrane says the current government is a legitimate, democratically elected government, but arguably that s not true at all. The current government wouldn t be in power if they hadn t recently used violence to kill or imprison their political rivals and crush their news and social media sites.Cochrane is advocating military escalation. That will inflict much more suffering on innocent people. If we shoot down Russian fighter jets, what stops further escalation? Cochrane says that choosing war against Russia now will prevent a future military conflict over Taiwan; will it? It seems entirely plausible that the opposite outcome will happen. A horrible war with Russia might reduce the will in the west to fight an even bigger war with China.Lastly, this isn t an issue of economics. Cochrane is entitled to his opinion, but has no special background or expertise that makes his opinion necessarily better than any other opinion.A good cautionary response.politepete ........ 1. you should read politico.2. you should examine the looting done by Yanukovych.Dear John, thanks a lot for your position. I m from Ukraine, Kyiv School of Economics (VP for economics education). Can i invite you to give a lecture on this in Kyiv (on-line of course)You ve lost your mind. It s sad to see. A no fly zone means US is shooting down Russian planes. You re basically asking to have a nuclear power actively engaging in military conflict with another nuclear power. Seriously. Think about this. The tail risks. What % odds do you put of miscalculation/fog of war/ escalation to general nuclear exchange? 5%? 10%? You should be better than this, and I m assuming this is heat of the moment, excessive twitter use, social desireability bias madness. But I d have expected better and think far less of you for this irresponsible post.Couldn t agree more. A no-fly zone means war with Russia, and yes, a double-digit chance of mushroom clouds in America.And for what? The Russian conventional military has already proven itself pathetic. The odds of them rolling on into NATO territory are miniscule at this point. They know and we know that they would lose if they did. Ukraine will be the farthest west they go, no matter where events go from here.John, thanks for posting this, I could not agree more. Going to war to save Ukraine is a very hard decision, but there are times when hard decisions cannot be avoided, and the logic outlined in your piece is brutally clear. Aggression will not stop until we stop it by force. The risk of nuclear conflict frightens me, but if we signal we are the only ones who fear it, and believe Russia does not, we might as well give them back East Berlin already. Our governments are still debating how much economic discomfort we are willing to bear as we impose sanctions, hoping we can soon go back to business as usual. That ship has sailed. Our way of life is under threat, and if we’re not willing not defend it, then we have already lost it. John, Elizabeth,I am still just stunned at what has transpired here, and it does remind me of Kuwait, when on the dawning day of the start of US actions in the 1st Gulf War, I found it very depressing to think  why did it come to this . At the time I was on temporary assignment in Japan for Intel and my local Japanese engineers were all excited the morning the US attacks began, while I found it very heavy and depressing that it come to that point. That said, your OpEd is spot on in that short term situation with the ongoing daily escalating Russian forces, attacks, and sieges of major Ukrainian population centers is very tense, tenuous, and at fulcrum situationally for very different possible futures. Short term, there is an escalating humanitarian crisis for the Ukrainian population, both in already occupied and under siege population centers across the country. Any action of the allies risks rapidly escalating events locally, regionally, globally, e.g., even just declaring and enforcing a no fly zone over Ukraine for purposes of airlifting food and humanitarian supplies would be a major risk for much greater escalations.It s a quagmire, with Putin apparently locked into the reactionary position that anything less than a captive Russian state version of Ukraine is an existential threat to the Russian state and people, something he has been moving towards relentlessly for the last 20 years of persistently resenting the breakup of the Soviet Union, and increasing alarm of the western  allies-i-zation  of former eastern bloc countries, even to the point he now regrets having supported US leveraging mid Asian states during a mutually interested fight against terrorism after 9/11 in Afghanistan.I have to ask myself, what would other leaders have done here? Biden and Obama before him certainly project weakness, with any commits of real US forces on the ground always the position of last resort, which doesn t work well in the real world or in the playground in the presence of bullies.Any real escalation by the US and western allies would be simultaneous to persistent diplomatic efforts to get Putin to accept losing the war and allowing a free and independent Ukraine, which is going to be extremely challenging. You may be right in that the time to act is here, but the risks for larger multi dimensional escalations and with significant long term deleterious effects on many fronts is also real and very challenging ground.Regards, Mike RodgersWhat does game theory say here? We have ceded the nuclear leverage to Putin. He controls the playing field in Ukraine. Belarusians, Chechens, mercenaries, may enter. Others no. What then for South Koreans and Taiwan if this is our playbook?Game theory would suggest that if Mr. Putin wants to play Wild West shootout, it s time for the  Dead or Alive  posters to be put up:See:https://news.yahoo.com/russian-businessman-places-1m-bounty-231620021.htmlWill any of your children be fighting the Russians for Ukraine?In 2014, Russian attack to Crimea and Donbass was not punished. True, some cocktail parties were cancelled but otherwise the sanctions were just a substitute for words ”not our problem”. This time Biden promised the same recipe: sanctions but definitely NO more (no force). Putin learned the lesson. And the game continues as long as we rules stay the same. See:https://news.yahoo.com/russian-businessman-places-1m-bounty-231620021.htmlHas the crowd funding site been set up yet?Will the world s first trillionaire be the guy that takes out Putin?You are assuming that Putin is rational and will not go nuclear. That s a really bad assumption. We need to reserve taking that risk for an attack on a NATO country.It is so tempting to agree. It seems pretty likely that a NATO enforced no fly zone combined with air attacks on Russian forces would have a devasting effect on the invasion. But that means many more Russian dead at the hands of US and NATO forces. Might that not strengthen Putin? The alternative of leaving the fighting to Ukrainians while providing whatever materiel they can effectively use seems superior-- especially when Russian morale is already so low you see Russian some soldiers abandoning equipment and even pre-emptively surrendering. The cost of this approach is move devastation of cities in Ukraine, but this approach still seems like the best approach in the longer run. First thought is that someone needs to buy John and Elizabeth a couple of plane tickets to Ukraine or the nearest country so they can join the fight, but leave the rest of the world out of it. I am not in favor of risking nuclear holocaust over the Ukrainian dictatorship. It is amazing how the fury of war propaganda can lead otherwise rational individuals to the conclusion that civilizations end is worth risking. While I love the USA, I am not so young as to think US foreign policy isn t belligerent. Must the USA constantly be at war with someone. 20 years in Afghanistan and all the war in between isn t enough? But this time we won t be pushing around little countries, we will be up against a nuclear power. I could go on about the stupidity of NATO expansion; perhaps looking at things from Russia perspective; the years of hating Russia over what turns out to be a hoax. Talk about mass formation psychosis over Russia and Ukraine! I find it hard to fathom how any remotely rational person could be advocating armed conflict between 2 major nuclear powers: especially with questionable and possibly unpredictable leaders in charge. Some suggest Putin has lost his marbles, while other suggest he is merely sowing confusion as a tactic so people don t guess at his real objectives. He has more room to negotiate for what he really wants if people aren t clear what the objectives are and if they think he may go further than is rational in trying to achieve them.At the same time, many are concerned about Biden s mental acuity. Even if we can hope that he defers to competent specialists and is mostly a figurehead: he is still the one officially in control and if he is truly not fully competent might perhaps be driven polls to  look presidential  and  do something  and be too aggressive were he to get the US into this.Its unclear why the US should risk any actual involvement. Its unclear if even too harsh economic sanctions might lead an unpredictable Putin to over react and pull Nato countries into this and force the US or even more minor nuclear powers into this. Great post!Simply put. We should be oppossing Russia in Ukraine, the same way that we know now we should have opposed Nazi Germany invading Poland in 1939.That simpleNot that simple. Do you see any Republicans seeking tax increases to pay for this opposition?https://taxfoundation.org/historical-income-tax-rates-brackets/Tax Rates by year1940 - Bottom 4%, Top 79%1941 (US Enters WWII) - Bottom 10%, Top 81%1942 - Bottom 19%, Top 88%1943 - Bottom 23%, Top 94%1944 - Bottom 23%, Top 94%Instead the federal debt and inflation grows effectively taxing the bottom part of the tax bracket. politepete  is correct. John starts with a wrong postulate, the Ukrainian is democratic, and arrives at a wrong conclusion -- it is worth risking a nuclear war with hundreds of millions dead. Let me add that not only Viktor Yanukovych was ousted, but his agreement with opposition leaders to stop violence and to conduct early elections signed with foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland was broken in couple days. The Minsk agreements were never honored as well. Pro-Russian politician, meaning Ukrainians who are for good relationships with Russia and for mutually beneficial economic ties, were prosecuted and sanctioned (both by the US and by Ukrainian government). Russian language was restricted/banned. High ranked Ukrainian officials openly called Russian people and Russian supporters to be second-class people. This all was in the news (not US news, of course, but it was on BBC news). John, there is absolutely no problem with voicing your opinion in this blog post. However, for your own benefit, you ought to do some basic research instead of just relaying on American mass media:(1) Check on Wikipedia articles about Ukraine-Russia relationships, 2014 war and 2021-2021 conflict (still on-going, unfortunately), Minsk agreements, etc. (2) It might be worthy reading about 2003 Iraqi war on Wiki and comparing the two wars (the timelines, events, casualties, etc).(3) An article on Wikipedia about the Peace Treaty of Versailles and its consequences is worth reading.(3) You might also perhaps find and read an English transcript of Putin s speech dated 02/23, in which he declares the war. Even if you do not believe any single word, wouldn t is be worthy for a prudent researcher to know what the enemy thinks?  politepete  is correct.

The Minsk agreements were never honored as well.

Even if you do not believe his single word, wouldn t is be worthy for a researcher to know what the enemy thinks? First, I deeply respect your opinions on economic and related issues. I am always recommending or quoting your columns to friends and family. Thank you for helping your readers make sense of confusing economic events and policies, especially via the sources you cite. Second, who with a human heart cannot join you in wishing -- demanding! -- an end to the death and destruction that Putin is visiting on Ukraine? Third, I wish for Ukraine to keep its national autonomy and the people their political self-determination. Given all that, I am wondering about your opinion of the Ukrainian election that installed the government that was subsequently overthrown by coup in 2014. Was that election rigged, and what of elections held after the coup?Putin plays chess; Americans play poker. I think Biden has played his cards well, and is still holding. He has been strategically ambiguous, so he has Putin guessing how far to go tit-for-tat up the escalation chain – a strategy that Obama did not want to play.First, as long as it is land armies in battle, Ukraine should be able to hold out, if not outright defeat the Russians. The West needs to supply the Ukraine effort and give whatever other support is needed. It is important that Ukrainians win their battle, and not others win it for them. They can do this.Second, it is important that the Western Alliance hold together along with the rest of the international community. Biden has done a good job on this, not going too fast for some reluctant NATO members who are now fully onboard. Putin really miscalculated on this, as well as a number of American commentators – Victor Davis Hanson for one, as well as some of your other Hoover “experts”.And third, when it comes to Putin’s use of air power and missiles, I think at some point the United States especially, along with other NATO members, will have to militarily intervene.Fourth, the sanctions are working. Because Putin invaded, the U.S. and NATO get to play with all the tools of hybrid warfare; something Obama was too restrained from doing. There is still a lot more on the table that Biden and the Alliance have not used yet; so it is going to be drip-by-drip for a while. Get used to it.And finally, strategically it is important for the West to stay out this militarily if it can and let the Ukrainians handle it and hopefully have a good outcome. Putin has a disrespect for democracies, and thinks authoritarian rule is more stable than “messy” democratic governance. A Ukrainian victory, where the West stays out of it and only resorts to sanctions and other hybrid/unconventional tactics, would be a tremendous blow to Putin’s ego. And you just may get political change in Russia, from within instead of an outside “conqueror”. Mourir pour Danzig?No, and Putin knows it. Everything was fine with the West when Ukraine was part of the Soviet empire, and Putin knows it.There will be some kind of demarche to get some kind of mutually acceptable solution. My question is whether a solution might have been agreed upon before the shooting started. I do not know the answer.How about a buffer state?I do not know whether Putin would accept.This war against Russia can be won without the US firing a single shot. Find a Treasury Secretary willing to kick gold s ass and this war will soon be over.No, anonymous Bitcoin and other digital currencies are not the solution.No, raising interest rates (and associated government interest payments) are not the solution because of the Fisher effect and because of the Ponzi limit.But since we rely solely on war dog economists for policy advice, this is the road we have been led down. This comment has been removed by the author.A no fly zone would require us to take out air defense systems, many of which are located in Russia. Therefore, for us to provide the support you are suggesting, we would essentially need to strike the Russian homeland.Yes. No-fly-zone is a term that is great against an opponent you have beaten. This is not the case with the opponent in Ukraine. It s another term for war.We intellectuals are adept at conducting the war of words.I rarely disagree with your brilliant articles. This one is way off. Challenging a nuclear power like Putin with a no-fly-zone or similar is like poking in the eye a angry bear, with theather and tactical end strategic weapons. There is a good chance he will use them.All for what ? For Ukraine ? a semi-failed state hungry for NATO and EU money with deep historical ties to Russia.haven t we had enough of regime change or Democracy building With excellent results in Libya, Iraq, Afgnanistan and Syria. this was an awful article which reveals serious lack of analytical skills. You are relly advocating the dignificant risk of a nuclear conflict in Europe for a failed and corrupt country like Ukraine, Ukarine that only wants to enter NATO e and the UE to get access to billions of euroes and dollars of free lunches? You must be kidding...Thanks for saying this John, agree completely and appreciate the facts you presentIf we replaced  Ukraine  with  Vietnam , what would the main differences be?The US can do more and should. You are so absolutely right. Other than their nukes, Russia is nothing more than a fading, regional power. Their population is dying off, as is Ukraine s. Their army is struggling to capture positions tens of miles from their borders. Yes, it s horrible what they ve done, but it s not worth America going to war. Go take a look at the German order of battle for the invasion of Poland in 1939. Their invasion force was 15 times the size of what Putin is able to muster to attack Ukraine. Ukraine vs Russia is the international equivalent of bum fights. If NATO wants to intervene so bad, let the Poles and the Germans do it.Finally, it s surreal to worry about Ukraine s borders when our own are totally undefended. Every 3 weeks, more illegals invade our country than Russia has troops attacking Ukraine.Disagree completely. Putin has finally learned that he cannot make agreements with the west (U.S.) because the west (U.S.) NEVER abides by such agreements... just ask any native american about that. For eight years he s been trying to get Ukraine to abide by the minsk accords, to no avail. The expansion of NATO is the sole cause of Putin s actions and every death there is the result of the U.S. pushing for ever more NATO encroachment to the borders of Russia. I guess you missed that bit of history, what.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_agreements#Minsk_Protocolhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATOI don t know who you are, but thank God you re not in charge.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

		<title>Important questions unasked of the Fed</title>
		<description> p This weekend s WSJ essay   a href= https://www.wsj.com/articles/march-2020-how-the-fed-averted-economic-disaster-11645199788  target= _blank  How the Fed Averted Economic Disaster /a    nbsp;by Nick Timiraos finally brings into public discussion the second question we should all be asking of the Fed. What happened in the grandest bailout of all time in the covid crisis, and, more importantly, having done it twice, how are we going to avoid massive bailouts becoming the normal state of affairs? (The first question, of course, is  how did you miss inflation so drastically and when are you going to do something about it? ) nbsp; /p  blockquote  p They were offering nearly unlimited cheap debt to keep the wheels of finance turning, and when that didn’t help, the Fed began purchasing massive quantities of government debt outright. /p  /blockquote  p Translation: When dealer banks weren t buying treasury debt fast enough, the Fed lend the banks money to buy the debt, and quickly bought up the massive amount of debt themselves. nbsp; /p  p The Fed followed by bailing out money market funds, buying state and local government debt, buying exchange-traded funds that held junk corporate debt, and announcing a do whatever it takes pledge to keep corporate bond prices high. It worked /p  p It worked. The Fed’s pledges to backstop an array of lending, announced on Monday, March 23, would unleash a torrent of private borrowing based on the mere promise of central bank action—together with a massive assist by Congress, which authorized hundreds of billions of dollars that would cover any losses. /p  blockquote  p ...Carnival Corp. , the world’s largest cruise-line operator. Its business had collapsed as Covid halted cruises world-wide. Within days of the Fed’s announcement, Carnival was able to borrow nearly $6 billion from large institutional investors...If the hardest-hit companies like Carnival, with its fleet of 104 ships docked indefinitely, could raise money in capital markets, who couldn’t? /p  /blockquote  p Let s be clear who is bailed out here: Creditors. People who lent lots of money to shaky businesses, earned nice high yields in good times, now have the Fed and Treasury bail them out in bad times. nbsp; /p  p It worked. nbsp; /p  blockquote  p Today, nearly two years later, most agree that the Fed’s actions helped to save the economy from going into a pandemic-induced tailspin.  /p  /blockquote  p I agree. A crisis was imminent, a toppling of a vastly over-leveraged house of cards was in the works. As  just in time  supply chains discovered they needed a bit of extra inventory around, just in time debt financing falls apart at the slightest shock, needing a bit of cash inventory and equity buffer. nbsp; /p  blockquote  p The Fed’s initial response in 2020 received mostly high marks—a notable contrast with the populist ire that greeted Wall Street bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis. North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, gave Mr. Powell an “A-plus for 2020,” he said. “On a one-to-10 scale? It was an 11. He gets the highest, highest marks, and deserves them. The Fed as an institution deserves them.” /p  /blockquote  p I also agree, almost. But  nbsp; /p  blockquote  p The question now is what will be the long-term costs and implications of that emergency activism—for the Fed, the financial markets and the wider economy. nbsp; /p  /blockquote  p  i This is the question. Why did the economy get into a nbsp;situation once again, so soon, that the Fed had to engineer this massive bailout? What are you nbsp;going to do to make sure you don t have to do it again and again? nbsp; /i  span style= font-style: italic;   /span  /p  a name= more   /a  p  /p  p Some people have spoken: nbsp; /p  blockquote  p Paul Singer, who runs the hedge-fund firm Elliott Management, warned that the Fed was sowing the seeds of a bigger crisis by absolving markets of any discipline. “Sadly, when people (including those who should know better) do something stupid and reckless and are not punished,” he wrote, “it is human nature that, far from thinking that they were lucky to have gotten away with something, they are encouraged to keep doing the stupid thing.” /p  /blockquote  p I.e., run companies with a lot of debt, buy a lot of high-yield junk debt, knowing that the Fed will do whatever it takes to keep the value of that debt from falling in bad times, even to the extent, now, of buying it directly. nbsp; /p  blockquote  p Reservations about Mr. Powell’s make-people-whole mantra weren’t limited to the free-market libertarian set.  /p  /blockquote  p Guilty as charged. nbsp; /p  blockquote  p The breathtaking speed with which the Fed moved and with which Wall Street rallied after the Fed’s announcements infuriated Dennis Kelleher, a former corporate lawyer and high-ranking Senate aide who runs Better Markets, an advocacy group lobbying for tighter financial regulations. /p  /blockquote  blockquote  p “Literally, not only has no one in finance lost money, but they’ve all made more money than they could have dreamed,” said Mr. Kelleher. “It just can’t be the case that the only thing the Fed can do is open the fire hydrants wide for everybody. This is a ridiculous discussion no matter how heartfelt Powell is about ‘we can’t pick winners and losers’—to which my answer is, ‘So instead you just make them all winners?’” /p  /blockquote  p The last time around, public outrage forced at least some disquiet about  moral hazard,  promises to do something so it wouldn t happen again. No More Bailouts. It produced the misbegotten Dodd-Frank law and it just happened again, on steroids. At least, though, there was the decency to notice. Outside this blog and a few other eccentrics, nobody seems to notice or care. We are now firmly in the system of huge leverage, private gain in good times, public guarantee in bad times. Where are our inequality warriors on the left, and tea party hat types on the right? Or at least, where are our economists who understand moral hazard in the middle? Where is any shame from the Fed that its army of Dodd Frank regulators and stress testers so completely missed the fact that the financial system was ripe for breakdown in the next crisis, so long as it did not exactly repeat the previous one? nbsp; /p  p Timiaros writes nbsp; /p  blockquote  p ...because the pandemic shock was akin to a natural disaster, it allowed Mr. Powell and the Fed to sidestep concerns about moral hazard—that is, the possibility that their policies would encourage people to take greater risks knowing that they were protected against larger losses. If a future crisis is caused instead by greed or carelessness, the Fed would have to take such concerns more seriously. /p  /blockquote  p  i  b This is absolutely wrong. /b  /i  nbsp; (Bold and italic, I m shouting from the rooftops.) The moral hazard is too much debt, both issued and bought, not enough cash lying around ready to pounce on opportunities, not enough balance sheet space to intermediate, all on the expectation that there will be no buying opportunities or danger of loss in the next dip. The  i source /i  of the shock is irrelevant. This fragility was caused by just as much  greed  and  carelessness  as the last one, eternals of human nature when incentives allow them. (I can just see it now.  The Fed diagnoses that the market collapse is due to too much Wall Street greed. Therefore, we re going to let companies go bankrupt and people lose their jobs?  ) nbsp; /p  p Pandemics happen. Wars happen. If you re of that ilk, climate risks happen. Sovereign debt collapses happen. Crises are always unpredicted. If they were predicted, they wouldn t be crises.  nbsp; nbsp; /p  p So, dear Fed, well done. The house was on fire, and you sent the entire fire department and put out the fire. A lot of people made a lot of money, as the federal debt and reserves skyrocketed. And now everyone expects more of the same next time. Not just the large bank bailouts of 2008; everyone expects that in a downturn you will buy corporate and junk bonds, as many as needed to keep prices from falling and anyone from losing money. How are you going to put this genie back in the bottle? /p  p ***** /p  p Question 2: Sarah Bloom Raskin is being questioned over the interesting coincidence that a fintech company got a  master account  at the Fed just after she joined the board. nbsp; /p  p The question here, for the Fed, is  i why did the Fed deny all the  b other /b  fintech companies that applied for master accounts? /i  Why is the Fed still  nbsp;forbidding narrow banks from operating? nbsp; /p  p Explanation: A master account at the Fed is like your bank account. Except it pays daily interest, and most of all allows instant transfer of funds from one financial institution to another. Fintech companies and narrow banks would love to give you interest-paying accounts, pay you interest, and give you much better, faster, and cheaper electronic transactions. Narrow banks would invest your money entirely in those reserves at the Fed. As a result, they can never fail. I mean that -- zero chance of failure, with essentially no regulation required. Zero chance of needing a bailout or the Fed to buy up all the assets to boost their prices, as it just did. nbsp; /p  p Why is the Fed blocking this? What you hear is a lot of fuzzy baloney about  systemic risk.  Once again, as with  climate risk to the financial system,  we pay the price that Dodd-Frank never defined  systemic risk,  allowing the Fed to use it as a catch all for anything it likes. Narrow banks cause zero systemic risk. nbsp; /p  p Narrow banks and fintech companies do pose a threat to traditional banks that pay you no interest, do not serve Americans with lower incomes, and charge big fees on your credit and debit cards.

Sadly, when people (including those who should know better) do something stupid and reckless and are not punished, he wrote, it is human nature that, far from thinking that they were lucky to have gotten away with something, they are encouraged to keep doing the stupid thing.” This is the question. Why did the economy get into a situation once again, so soon, that the Fed had to engineer this massive bailout? What are you going to do to make sure you don t have to do it again and again? Funny, I was just reading about one possible cause of this this morning: Exorbitant Privilege? Quantitative Easing and the Bond Market Subsidy of Prospective Fallen Angels https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1004.pdfThe Fed fails to understand that whenever wealth:gdp is high, the system will be prone to crisis (higher valuations make a flight to cash more attractive). Bailouts reward existing asset owners and creditors at the cost of keeping assets expensive for potential future owners.The American economy seems to thrive on borrowing. Even the creation of new money only occurs when commercial banks lend. The gigantic real estate sector is soaked in debt.Solutions?Make equity dividends tax free? Stimulate macroeconomic growth through money-financed fiscal programs (primarily tax holidays) and not borrowing?I think I agree with the thrust of this column, but you will have to concoct a new method for stimulating macroeconomic growth other than the build up of debt.If I understand matters correctly, there is already a huge amount of  cash on the sidelines. BC, Solutions? It is a misconception that the Federal Government must borrow under any circumstance. This misconception is perpetrated by more than 100 years of war dog economists (J. Yellen included), policy makers, politicians, and media cohorts.It is Constitutionally permitted for the US Treasury to sell equity claims against future tax revenue. Those equity claims should be a public good (as defined by Paul Samuelson) being both non-rivalrous (my claim on future tax revenue does adversely affect the government s financial position) and non-exclusive (equity sold by Treasury is available to any US taxpayer and is sold on demand rather than as a consequence of deficits). Understand that government bonds are a rivalrous good because of the Ponzi limit. It is illegal for the U.S. Treasury to pay bondholder interest payments with the sale of new bonds (Ponzi finance). I think I agree with the thrust of this column, but you will have to concoct a new method for stimulating macroeconomic growth other than the build up of debt. Equity sold by the US Treasury would reduce the federal debt regardless of other spending / taxation programs instituted by the Federal Government.Irving Fisher and a group of economists proposed a similar plan (called the Chicago Plan) calling for equity financed banking and the elimination of the federal reserve as lender of last resort.What I would propose is that since the unified banking system (courtesy of Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Alan Greenspan) refused to convert their outstanding debt into equity shares back during the crisis of 2010-11, the US Treasury should take their place as the seller of equity.Larry Summers and Robert Rubin had the opportunity to institute such a program but instead chose to sell TIPs and inflation indexed bonds instead (modeled after  Linkers  in Great Britain).Linkers, TIPs, and other inflation linked securities suffer the same problem that traditional bonds do - they are a rivalrous good in that the returns on them to individual holders are paid from available tax revenue supplied by all tax payers. During a stagflationary scenario where inflation rises but tax revenue falls, the payments on them can be put at risk.They (TIPs and other inflation indexed bonds) also suffer a political risk in the US. Because the inflation indexed component on them was not legislated into existence by Congress, a future Congress (seeking to cut federal expenditures) can chose to set the inflation component to whatever they feel like (including negative values) to fund government programs.I have outlined all of this in my Blog including an augmented Taylor rule describing both monetary policy and Treasury policy rules.Ben, If I understand matters correctly, there is already a huge amount of cash on the sidelines. You understand correctly. See:https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDDNSThe run up in demand deposits began around 2010.What that should tell you is that capitalism broke around that time and has never been fixed.And so you might ask yourself - stock indexes are near all time highs, why isn t all this money on the sidelines investing in stocks?Two reasons:1. The 9-11 attack revealed a weakness in the consolidation of equity markets centered in New York City. A centralized market works great but also puts up a big target for the nefarious.2. See the Ellsberg Paradox - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradox It is generally taken to be evidence for ambiguity aversion, in which a person tends to prefer choices with quantifiable risks over those with unknown risks. With publicly traded equity stocks there is a level of ambiguity / unknown risk that people may not tolerate - for instance the risk of a bunch of hijackers crippling the markets using airplanes as bombs.With equity sold by the Treasury, the risk is individualized.The best example I can give (as far as government programs) is Social Security. Social Security benefits are a risk asset in that you may end up paying more in taxes than what you receive in benefits.And yet it is a program that has stood the test of time with bi-partisan support despite being illiquid (I can t sell my accrued benefits to my neighbor).John, this is a dangerous way to think. Monetary policy is too blunt an instrument to punish a few bad actors without punishing the entire economy. The Fed must provide us with nominal stability. That s its job, its whole reason to exist. The Fed must do this whether or not any particular company or industry shows good character.Kenneth DudaMenlo Park, CAI m interested to know if you feel a Universal Basic Income is feasible and/or advisable?As at December 2021, some 78.5% of total federal debt is held by the American public, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. It s difficult to see how this proportion of debt held domestically presents a risk of sovereign default.Paul Singer is a speculator in financial markets. This is public knowledge. He would welcome a reduction in the number of competitors he faces daily, wouldn t you say?The Fed s mandate is price stability and full employment. How would a financial collapse help the Fed achieve either or both of those mandates? Paul Singer s operations might be spared, but who is Paul Singer to dictate what the Fed will or won t do in a crisis?From 2019Q4 to 2021Q3, in nominal dollars, the federal debt increased by $5.2 trillion, base money increased by $3 trillion, total reserves increased by $2.5 trillion, M2 increased by $5.4 trillion, and, nominal GDP increased by $2.3 trillion (after decreasing by $2.2 trillion by 2020Q2--a turn-around of $5.5 trillion). Of that $5.2 trillion increase in federal debt during that period, the American public holds $5.1 trillion of it. A little inflation is a small price to pay.The net effect of that debt increase is a redistribution of asset ownership amongst the American public. In the long-term, the federal debt will be repaid by the cohort of Americans who pay the greater share of federal taxes. That cohort is likely to be the largest holder of federal debt, directly or indirectly, as well. What goes around comes around; as Ing. Vilfredo Pareto, the Italian economist of the Laussane School noted in his population studies. This effect would not have been lost on the economists advising the White House in 2020, or the Fed economists advising the FOMC at the time.Finally, an observation: Decisions are made on the basis of information known at the time the decision is rendered. Hindsight is 20:20, it is said. After the fact, we can say whether a decision was right or wrong, and punish the transgressors through word or deed, as Congressional committees often do. But, the criticism is often of an academic character and largely unlikely to shed light on what should have been done based on the situation analysis by the decision-makers at the time in the heat of the moment. The legislation that results is, as you point out, and as I pointed out to colleagues in the investment business at the time, in the case of the Dodd-Frank bill, worse than the condition it was intended to cure. Aside: It continues to astonish this observer that good men and women continue to seek to serve in positions of public trust knowing full well that they will be punished for it whether deserved or not. The Fed s mandate is price stability and full employment. Actually, the only Fed mandate is price stability.See Humphrey Hawkin s Act of 1979.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey%E2%80%93Hawkins_Full_Employment_Act MANDATES the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability. Notice - The direction is given to the Federal Reserve board of governors. This is separate and distinct from the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.Somehow even supposedly well trained economist either don t understand or just ignore the distinction.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governorshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_CommitteeAnd while there is an overlap between the two groups (the 7 board members are also FOMC members), the responsibility for price stability lies with the board.The full employment mandate comes from an older Act of Congress - see:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Act_of_1946Do people read anymore?OEE, In the long-term, the federal debt will be repaid by the cohort of Americans who pay the greater share of federal taxes. That cohort is likely to be the largest holder of federal debt, directly or indirectly, as well. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFRBNThe Federal Reserve banks (as holders of nearly $6 Trillion in government debt) are far and away the largest single cohort. And so they are going to pay the greatest share of taxes?Well, gosh, why the heck are any of the rest of us paying taxes? Just have the Federal reserve banks put a bunch of deposits in the US Treasury account and call them  taxes .On your 2nd post, FRestly, you have overlooked a salient fact -- the FRBs pay 100% of their net income to the U.S. Treasury. In effect, the FRBs  marginal tax rate is 100%.On your 1st post, FRestly, you have read the objectives of the Hawkins-Humphrey act of 1978 too narrowly. Wikipedia (your citation) states: In brief, the Act:o Explicitly states that the federal government will rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve the four goals.o Instructs the government to take reasonable means to balance the budget.o Instructs the government to establish a balance of trade, i.e., to avoid trade surpluses or deficits.o Mandates the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability.o Instructs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to transmit a Monetary Policy Report to the Congress twice a year outlining its monetary policy.o Requires the President to set numerical goals for the economy of the next fiscal year in the Economic Report of the President and to suggest policies that will achieve these goals.o Requires the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to connect the monetary policy with the Presidential economic policy. The fourth and the seventh of these seven bulleted requirements ties the actions of the FRB and FOMC to the requirements placed on the government. The fifth requirement closes the control loop on the FRBs  actions in implementing monetary policy.In other words, fiscal policy and monetary policy are required to act together in harness. The fourth mandate is:o Mandates the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability.To maintain long-run growth, a condition of ‘full employment’ is a requisite, for otherwise monetary policy would be less than optimal as a different monetary policy that gives rise more efficient utilization of the nations resources (including labor) would yield a higher rate of economic growth. The physical feedback loop is personal consumption expenditures -- the unemployed consume less while placing a greater burden on government for social support and spending, ergo higher social transfers which reduce resources for productive economic growth (i.e., higher levels of taxation or government borrowing to fund transfers to the unemployed). Fiscal and monetary policies that achieve productive ‘full employment’ increase social welfare and reduce the tax burden on productive sectors of the economy, thereby reducing the ‘dead hand’ of government. Full employment in this sense is an implicit objective of the 1978 Act. And, it is in this sense, that the twin mandates are understood, a.s.OEE,The problem is when government ignores it s own requirements:1. Explicitly states that the federal government will rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve the four goals.2. Instructs the government to take reasonable means to balance the budget.3. Instructs the government to establish a balance of trade, i.e., to avoid trade surpluses or deficits.My point is that relying JUST on the central bank to accomplish all of these goals makes all of them difficult to achieve - which is why I isolated the explicit directions given to the Fed Board of Governors.With price stability responsibility given to the central bank, the responsibility for the rest falls upon government.If instead we want to rely solely on the central bank to achieve ALL of the goals, then it (the central bank) must get into the business of credit allocation deciding which business investments will lead to lower inflation, reduction in trade balance, reduction in federal budget deficits, etc.If we are going to rely solely on the central bank to achieve all of these goals, then we should grant them the tools to achieve them including:1. Rejecting private loans to companies / individuals that offshore their tax liability or simply dodge any tax liability.2. Rejecting private loans to companies / individuals that speculate on the price of commodities and other raw / intermediate goods.3. Rejecting loans to the federal government itself and any bank / business that purchases bonds issued by the federal government.OEE, On your 2nd post, FRestly, you have overlooked a salient fact -- the FRBs pay 100% of their net income to the U.S. Treasury. In effect, the FRBs  marginal tax rate is 100%. No, I didn t overlook that the FOMC can CHOOSE to either pay the interest payments that they receive from the federal government to banks as interest on reserves or they can CHOOSE to return the interest payments to the Treasury. There is no legal mandate that the FOMC must return interest payments back to the Treasury. The FOMC s marginal tax rate is whatever they want it to be. To maintain long-run growth, a condition of full employment is a requisite, for otherwise monetary policy would be less than optimal as a different monetary policy that gives rise more efficient utilization of the nations resources (including labor) would yield a higher rate of economic growth. The point of my post was this - relying SOLELY on the central bank to achieve multiple economic objectives (for instance balance of trade and budget) is a recipe for trouble.In the somewhat hypothetical, if the federal government set the age at which you begin receiving retirement benefits at age 45 instead of 65, how close do you think you would get to full employment REGARDLESS of what the central bank does?If you are going to rely SOLELY on the central bank to achieve multiple economic goals, then the ONLY way that happens is for the central bank to pick and chose which loans will result in higher employment, lower trade deficit, etc. - aka, credit allocation.Do you have evidence that the federal government is not relying primarily on the private sector to achieve the four goals?I stress again that you are interpreting the language of the Acts too narrowly. You have emphasized that the government is  - relying SOLELY  on the FRB  ...to achieve multiple economic objectives (for instance balance of trade and budget)... .  How do you arrive at that conclusion?Then,  ... if the federal government set the age at which you begin receiving retirement benefits at age 45 instead of 65, how close do you think you would get to full employment REGARDLESS of what the central bank does?  The real world example that fits your hypothetical scenario is Malaysia in the 1990s. The retirement age was set at 55 years of age, and it didn t negatively affect  full employment . Indeed, the government s policy was intended to promote full employment by forcing older workers out of the workforce when they reached the official mandatory retirement age, thereby opening positions to younger workers at a time when the Malaysian demographic statistics were highly skewed to the young. But that is government policy working through the private sector, not the central bank.The concept of full employment does not imply that there will be no unemployment. In any event the term  full employment  does not appear in the 1946 Act or 1978 Act.  Full employment  is just a short-hand way of describing the neutral rate of unemployment -- i.e., the level of unemployment at which the price level neither increases nor decreases, ceteris paribus. You will recognize this as the  Phillips Curve  effect. The parallel concept is the  neutral rate of interest  which is that rate of interest that neither accelerates economic growth and thereby lifting the rate of inflation, nor decelerates it giving rise to deflation. This is a Wicksellian concept, though the term Wicksell used was  the natural rate of interest  and it applied to the private sectors  cost of capital--if the bank rate exceeded the natural rate of interest, recession resulted, but if the bank rate was below the natural rate of interest, economic expansion resulted. At the natural rate of interest, growth was steady and the private sector earned its cost of capital. The concept of inflation was worked into this conceptual model, and employment followed the normal course--rising during economic expansion and falling during recessions.The trade balance depends on private sector competitiveness and government policy (excl. of the central bank, though the bank rate has an impact on the rate of foreign exchange which affects the balance of trade to a degree). A country whose currency serves as the World s reserve currency will inevitably run a trade deficit. Discontinue the USD as the World s reserve currency if you would rather run a trade surplus.Your last point is germane. Since the central bank does not engage in credit allocation decisions in normal economic situations (financial crises being excepted as being non-normal situations), we can infer, on the basis of this criterion, that the FRB is not being relied upon solely as the agent for the government to attain  the four goals .I now punt the ball back into your court.OEE, Do you have evidence that the federal government is not relying primarily on the private sector to achieve the four goals? Government stimulus checks?Have you had your head stuck in the mud all of this time? The retirement age was set at 55 years of age, and it didn t negatively affect full employment. Indeed, the government s policy was intended to promote full employment by forcing older workers out of the workforce when they reached the official mandatory retirement age. If we are going to arbitrarily define full employment as basically whatever age the federal government thinks is appropriate, then why not 22 years old? Problem solved!!! Anyone over the age of 22 that is not working is considered retired. Your last point is germane. Since the central bank does not engage in credit allocation decisions in normal economic situations (financial crises being excepted as being non-normal situations)... Not really. See John s statement above: This is absolutely wrong. (Bold and italic, I m shouting from the rooftops.) The moral hazard is TOO MUCH DEBT, both issued and bought....The source of the shock is irrelevant. When you understand that a government Treasury can sell equity in lieu of debt / bonds, then everything else falls into place including:1. Increasing the natural rate of interest / real economic growth rate2. Reducing trade deficits3. Increasing employment4. Restoring central bank independence focused on price stability. A country whose currency serves as the World s reserve currency will inevitably run a trade deficit. Nope, incorrect. The dollar has been the world s reserve currency since the Bretton Woods agreement. It wasn t until the Nixon shock and later Reaganomics that we developed persistent trade deficits.I have explained this to you more times than I can count.FRestly, a response to your reply:●  Government stimulus checks?  -- I would say that the transfer payments made in 2020 and 2021 are not evidence that the government is not relying on the private sector to achieve the four goals.●  Have you had your head stuck in the mud all of this time?  Your remark is intemperate, and not worthy of your abilities, nor is it conducive to a rational discussion of events and measures taken by the government and private sector in this forum. Save it for the bar room.●  If we are going to arbitrarily define full employment as basically whatever age the federal government thinks is appropriate, then why not 22 years old? Problem solved!!! Anyone over the age of 22 that is not working is considered retired.  If you say so. The example of Malaysia was presented in response to your earlier remark, and not a recommendation for the USA which has the opposite problem--i.e., a population demographic which is increasingly weighted towards the elderly and an insufficient proportion of younger working age adults.●  Not really. See John s statement above:  This is absolutely wrong. (Bold ... .   John Cochrane s statement pertains to  moral hazard , i.e., the negative externality imposed upon society by private sector actors who rely on limited liability to avoid shouldering the consequences of their actions when the market moves against their leveraged positions and the Federal Reserve and the federal government are forced to step in to stop runs on the financial intermediaries that result from those actors  behavior. He is speaking from the perspective of a general tax payer whose future income and wealth will be burdened by government taxes and/or inflation arising from the government s and/or the Federal Reserve s support to the markets. His remark does not speak to credit allocation by the Federal Reserve System, per se.●  When you understand that a government Treasury can sell equity in lieu of debt / bonds, then everything else falls into place  This is your conception of a security that the U.S. Treasury could, theoretically speaking, utilize. For its effectiveness, it relies on the private sector to take up the hypothetical securities, as we ve discussed previously. It is not a security that the Treasury has issued up to the present time.●  Nope, incorrect. The dollar has been the world s reserve currency since the Bretton Woods agreement.  The USD was not the world s reserve currency at the time of the Bretton Woods agreement (July 1944). The Bretton Woods arrangement became functional in 1958. The agreement pegged the value of the USD to gold at $35/troy oz. A currency peg to gold has straight-forward dynamics that require the country pegging to gold to maintain a positive or neutral trade balance. If that country runs a trade deficit, then it must either close the trade deficit and run a trade surplus or it must raise its interest rates to attract gold to it, or lose its gold reserves. The agreement collapsed because the US wasn t prepared to discipline itself to maintain the peg. France which was running a trade surplus with the US at the time demanded gold in exchange for dollars; Nixon then broke the peg because the US had printed more dollars than there was gold in Fort Knox to back those dollars. It took until 1971 for the system to break. Nothing happens overnight.●  I have explained this to you more times than I can count.  Scolding now?OEE, Government stimulus checks? -- I would say that the transfer payments made in 2020 and 2021 are not evidence that the government is not relying on the private sector to achieve the four goals. What in your mind would be evidence? ...and the Federal Reserve and the federal government are forced to step in to stop runs on the financial intermediaries that result from those actors  behavior. No one  forced  Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, etc. to convert bank debt to Treasury debt - who are you trying to kid here? Paulson could have told his investment banking friends to convert their debt liabilities to equity shares (the Chicago Plan) OR he could have begun selling equity shares out of the Treasury and using the funds to pay off banking debt.I have explained this to you more times than I can count. - Scolding now?Pretty much. It took seemingly forever to get you to engage in a discussion of government equity, which I do appreciate when you finally came around. So sometimes I get exasperated. This is your conception of a security that the U.S. Treasury could, theoretically speaking, utilize. For its effectiveness, it relies on the private sector to take up the hypothetical securities, as we ve discussed previously. It is not a security that the Treasury has issued up to the present time. Because? I mean really I don t get it. Has this country been at war for so long that the fields of economics and public policy have become entirely enshrouded in the fog of war?The Chicago Plan was proposed in 1933 by Irving Fisher, et al., and answered in 1935 in the negative. It was resurrected in 1939, and then shelved. It was again resurrected in 2012, with modifications in a working paper published by the IMF, but never gained traction. In 2019, Christine Lagarde dismissed it, saying that she was not convinced  that eliminating the role of private banks in the supply of ‘broad’ money is a good idea . [Wikipedia: Chicago Plan] John Cochrane, in this blog space, has promoted  narrow banking  (essentially, The Chicago Plan of Irving Fisher, et al.) while noting that the FRB has rejected every application for  Narrow Banks . Your  Government Equity  concept is hypothetical in nature. It requires a taxpayer who is willing to purchase forward contracts from the IRS, i.e., pay cash money, to pre-pay a future uncertain tax liability some n years ahead of the liability s due date. It is not the Chicago Plan. It would not raise money in any situation like that which occurred in late 2008 and 2009. The players then were not regulated commercial deposit taking banks, but were unregulated or self-regulated  investment banks , and hedge funds and insurance companies. Contrary to your assertion, the two alternatives facing Paulson and Bernanke at that instant were (1) to provide unlimited access to federal funds (Treasury or FRB) or (2) allow the U.S. financial system to work it out for themselves without federal assistance at the risk of significant damage to the U.S. financial system collectively and to the reputation of U.S. government. Hindsight is 20:20 and you are applying that normative standard here in your remarks.What I stated viz.  Government Equity  ( GE ) was (a) I m not a buyer, and (b) you haven t had any success in convincing the Sec. of the Treasury or the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank System to buy into it and present it to Congress for approval. I pointed out the inherent risks that GE (as first described by you in this blog space) presented to a potential purchaser and why I thought that it would not be an attractive proposition to a business owner. I haven t troubled to follow up on your latest variation on GE, so you may consider my views to be  out of date . Be that as it may be, there is no likelihood that GE will be adopted by the Treasury anytime soon, in my humble opinion.As to the Chicago Plan, forcing commercial banks to reduce their loans outstanding to the level of their book equity plus deposits--i.e., eliminating fractional banking in the U.S.--would lead to an economic depression presaged by widespread bankruptcies and considerable population dislocations. John Cochrane s support for  Narrow Banks  (no fractional banking) is limited specifically to bank charters for new banks (essentially  savings and loan  companies, or  trust companies ) that can only lend up to 100% of their reserves held in the Federal Reserve Bank System or as vault reserves (cash, bullion and species). The point of these new  Narrow Banks  is to access the FRB s federal funds rate or interest on excess reserves ( IOERs ), and not as sources of new loans although that is not necessarily precluded.  Narrow Banks  would not be able to compete against the regulated fractional-banking system banks for loans and deposits (which come with those loans and other services).As to the question,  What in your mind would be evidence? , my reply is that I am not the one challenging the status quo--it is up to the challenger of the status quo to prove the validity of his thesis, or give it up.Seems to me the Fed needs better tools, if they can be engineered. You know the saying - if you re a hammer, everything looks like a nail: pandemics, wars, climate threats, natural disasters. But maybe liquidity is the best hammer/tool in the toolbox. I ve often wondered if 5/5/5 is an economic sweet spot: 5% UNRATE, 5% FFF, and NAIRU = 5%. It worked pretty well through the 1990 s until a bunch of economists thought it was a good idea to fund a bunch of investment bank bailouts and never-ending wars on the cheap.https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFFPowell s job was to control the money stock so as to control inflation. But Powell continues to buy bonds, he removed Reg. D restrictions on savings  withdrawals, and he eliminated reserve requirements. Powell hasn t reversed anything he unleased and inflation is at 40-year highs.The truth is probably closer to, if the fertilizer had been allowed to hit the fan, the economy would briefly have tanked. Pols and voters would have seen that the price of COVID panic was too high and gone back to business as usual. By now the US economy would be back on course with the reversal showing as only a brief dip in the rearview mirror. The doubtless well-meant rescue measures have only succeeded in multiplying the misery, and extending its timescale for decades to come.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

On whale-disturbance grounds. ...In California, environmentalists have used a state law designed to protect fish eggs as a pretext to close the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, the state’s largest source of clean energy, while the California Environmental Quality Act has hobbled efforts to build both high-speed rail and high-voltage transmission lines that the state is counting on to meet its climate commitments.  ..over the last decade, the U.S. hasn’t constructed a single major new transmission line.High speed rail, billions over budget, the prize of the 2009 shovel-ready stimulus programs, has not laid a single mile of track. It will probably be ready at gold-plated cost, just as the last car and truck on I-5 is electric. Electrification is big news. But the electricity has to come from somewhere, over power lines that have to be built. Where I live they just banned gas hookups. For now, we burn gas to make electricity, then send it over nonexistent power lines to turn the electricity into heat, at about half the efficiency of just burning it at home. I guess the idea is that after we ve burned about twice as much gas as we need for a decade, eventually it will all come from those new solar panels that work at night. (In related news, in New Jersey s similar plan to switch from gas to electricity which comes, for now, from gas, The Department of Environmental Protection, which is mulling new regulations for boiler permits, said in a rule proposal unveiled in December that electric boilers would cost between 4.2% and 4.9% more to operate than their gas counterparts. But a correction issued by the agency Tuesday said running electric boilers would cost between 4.2 and 4.9 times more than their fossil fuel equivalents.Whoops!) Nuclear power remains a catastrophe: In Washington, D.C., meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission peremptorily rejected last month the application of the first advanced nuclear reactor developer to seek a license before the commission, to cheers from leading environmental groups.... ...Merely completing an environmental-impact statement for infrastructure projects now takes almost five years on average. The US is still capable of dumping trillions of dollars down ratholes,Though the Biden administration and Democrats currently propose to spend close to a trillion dollars on low-carbon infrastructure and technology, there is little reason to believe the U.S. is capable of building any of it in a timely or cost-effective way.And it s going to get worse (see previous post on how FHWA literally bans new infrastructure )  ...Democrats and environmentalists propose to add still more bureaucratic and regulatory requirements to the already Kafkaesque process of building any major energy or infrastructure project. President Biden’s landmark executive order on environmental justice, for example, has directed every federal agency to screen all new infrastructure and clean-energy spending for disparate racial impact while carving out 40% of all spending for marginalized communities. Congress, meanwhile, has produced complicated formulas to guide its proposed new clean-energy investments in order to encourage the use of union labor and to achieve various other wage and occupational outcomes.Nordhaus has some positive ideas on how to fix this mess: start with an overhaul of the NEPA [National Environmental Policy Act, under which you can sue to stop projects based on the tiniest environmental claim], the ESA [Endangered Species Act], the Jones Act [All shipping between US ports must be on US merchant marine ships. Also the send-it-by-truck act]  and a range of other regulations in order to make them more compatible with the need to dramatically cut emissions. Another priority should be to change the NRC’s mandate so that it balances public safety with the public’s interest in building nuclear power plants to produce clean and affordable energy.And a special nod to California Federal taxpayers should not send billions of dollars to the states every year without a reasonable expectation that the funded infrastructure will be built in a timely and cost-effective way.The Government trying to promote the construction of infrastructure using taxpayer money while government enhanced regulation (by the same  Government ) prevents the construction of this very same infrastructure is a  beautiful  case of public choice theory: in reality governments don t work like their favorite narratives could make you believe they do.In any case this is far from being an exceptionality of the US. In Germany I can t wait to see how the battle between climate activist and conservationist over wind turbines unfold.Once you enter the realm of the  political market  any costly stupidity can happens (a risk that it is only mitigated by the fact that, most of the times, nothing happens given the  veto power  of so many constituencies in this political market)https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/17/germanys-plans-for-wind-power-are-dauntingly-ambitiousEnjoying the coverage of these energy snafus! The root of the opposition to energy / infrastructure at large is an anti-human philosophy, that views human action or impact as being evil as such. Notice how there is ALWAYS a reason for opposition: whether the trees, the butterflies, the bats, the sturgeon - all take priority over human existence and what human existence requires.  For now, we burn gas to make electricity, then send it over nonexistent power lines to turn the electricity into heat, at about half the efficiency of just burning it at home. Heat pumps are a thing FYI. It s usually more efficient to burn gas in a turbine to make electricity to power a heat pump, than burning it in a boiler. And that was if all the electricity were gas, which it obviously wouldn t be.This comment has been removed by the author.This comment has been removed by the author.At this point in time, the  status quo  is ALWAYS the best option. New regulation or any regulatory change would be counterproductive. It has been like that for a long time now.From Reason interviewing Coase:Reason: Can you give us an example of what you consider to be a good regulation and then an example of what you consider to be a not-so-good regulation?Coase: This is a very interesting question because one can’t give an answer to it. When I was editor of The Journal of Law and Economics, we published a whole series of studies of regulation and its effects. Almost all the studies–perhaps all the studies–suggested that the results of regulation had been bad, that the prices were higher, that the product was worse adapted to the needs of consumers, than it otherwise would have been. I was not willing to accept the view that all regulation was bound to produce these results. Therefore, what was my explanation for the results we had? I argued that the most probable explanation was that the government now operates on such a massive scale that it had reached the stage of what economists call negative marginal returns. Anything additional it does, it messes up.The whole interviewhttps://reason.com/1997/01/01/looking-for-results/Just pray fusion works. And if not that, magic and chanting. Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

Isn t the economic driving force, the fact that Americans will pay more for the electricity? I suppose some bureaucrat will get a warm feeling as NY moves closer to their 70% goal, but from the standpoint of carbon emissions, this project is nonsense, because of transmission losses.Couple of potential reasons. IIRC they have a surplus. They want to expand one way or another. New York City is a metropolis that s relatively close to Québec. Aside from the red tape, the national political border doesn t make it further away physically. NYC may be willing to pay more or pay it sooner than the other nearby places the power provider could export to. Someone can correct me if I m off-base here, but would replacing NYC s current  less-than-green  power sources with surplus from a hydropower plant still be nonsense from a carbon emissions standpoint, even with transmission losses?I live in a country with almost all rivers blocked with dams. And we have no migratory fishes anymore. It is a bad trade off, I d take nuclear over that any day. The legal and regulatory Gordian Knot that binds down those who would provide new and expanded infrastructure -- especially for power, water, and transportation -- will have to be dealt with in the same way that Alexander dispatched the legendary original one, except with us voters in the role of Alexander, I think.Comments are welcome.

		<text>John Cochrane s blogWhat rights do we need to guarantee our political freedom. Well, the right to speak freely, of course. The right peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Even in trucks. But without economic freedom you cannot have political freedom. The right to work, which requires the right to hire. If the government, or political pressure groups, can stop you from being hired, you cannot speak, you cannot assemble, you cannot act politically. Communist countries didn t need to put people in jail. They could just stop them from working. And the right to transact, freely and anonymously. If the government can monitor your transactions, freeze your assets,  sanction  you, or freeze your ability to transact, to buy or sell anything, it can quickly silence you, stop your political participation, undermine political movements or even aspiring individual politicians. This is playing out in Canada right now. I have stated the principle before, but now we have a good example before us of just what the danger is. I don t care how you feel about the truckers, but look at the power the government has used to silence their political protest. The government can use the same power to silence individuals. Or protests from the left. Reports that there are bank runs and outages as Canadians try to quickly take money out of banks are an interesting consequence. This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto. If we have arbitrary, cheap, completely anonymous transactions, tax evasion, theft (ransomware), fraud, can go haywire. If we have complete surveillance and control, political  liberty goes out the window. Just found your blog. Interesting reading   great to hear you.Here s how the priorities should work:1. Human rights (right to body)2. Contract rights (right to collaborate)3. Property rights4. Political rights (ability to affect policy toward others)These are implicitly commandments 6-9. You don t have effective property rights unless theft is prosecuted, contract rights unless violation is prohibited, or human rights unless murder is prosecuted. Similarly, if abuse of the political system is permitted, the political system loses its legitimacy and we effectively lose political rights too. Excellent synopsis. Thx. Especially grounding our rights in Scripture. Rational governance is Supra-rationally grounded in the ineffable. Hobbes, like Machiavelli before him, promoted the idea that monitoring really does matter. And, like North, institutions restrict an option set, not by virtue of the probability of being caught, but the certainty of it. The US government shut down railroads strikes in the late 1800 s because rail cars were being used to transport US Mail. So there s a precedent in the US for shutting down protests that interfere with government business and general commerce. I m not sure what the equilibrium will be with digital commerce when it comes to enforcement. With fintech, all transactions can be harvested and flagged based on who writes the algorithms and for what purpose. This makes the MC of fighting corruption potentially very low, but with unknown externalities.  Weapons of Math Destruction  by Cathy O Neil does a great job of exposing how algorithms can be used to punish and restrict economic activity and opportunity. Regarding crypto - I believe the Treasury dept has been laying down some regulations for transactions on Crypto Exchanges as a means to monitor wealth creation. How it could be used to monitor potential criminal activity is another matter. Converting crypto to whatever fiat currency still requires some work, but the lineage of transactions being anonymous presents issues. Surveillance capitalism isn t just on the social media side: it ll find its way into transactions, too. Already recommender engines use transaction logs to suggest more stuff to buy. Can build a preference model of that data, along with search.  You can run, but you cannot hide. John, This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto. If we have arbitrary, cheap, completely anonymous transactions, tax evasion, theft (ransomware), fraud, can go haywire. If we have complete surveillance and control, political liberty goes out the window. It s not really that hard a question to answer. The answer is that you must migrate away from your thinking about transactions in terms of two parties and move toward three party transactions. That third party can be government but does not need to be.In a two party transaction it takes the mutual consent of both parties for the transaction to take place.P1 - No, P2 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes - Transaction happensIn one of four (25%) cases, the transaction takes place.Contrast that with three party transactions:P1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensIn 4 of 8 cases (50%), the transaction happens.Markets are INEFFICIENT because they rely predominantly on two party transactions.Samuelson and Fama are incorrect.No-one is going to want to participate in a system where any two parties can conspire to force a transaction on an unwilling third party, which your example implies.If all three parties have to agree, then the transaction occurs in only 1 in 8 cases (12.5%). But, that s irrelevant: the probabilities of the 8 cases are not equal; they depend on expectations of value creation.Anonymous, But, that s irrelevant: the probabilities of the 8 cases are not equal; they depend on expectations of value creation. The probabilities on the 4 cases in a two party transaction are not equal either; they also depend on expectations of value creation.The point of the exercise was to do an apples to apples comparison of two party and three party transactions. No-one is going to want to participate in a system where any two parties can conspire to force a transaction on an unwilling third party, which your example implies. Do you live in a cave or on some deserted island?See prosecutor (party #1), jury (party #2), and defendant (party #3) in any criminal proceeding.Or see taxation for that matter. Can two parties (elected representatives and other voters) conspire to force me to pay taxes? They most certainly can. I will have a vote in the matter, but as with my three party example, I may get outvoted.John, This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto. If we have arbitrary, cheap, completely anonymous transactions, tax evasion, theft (ransomware), fraud, can go haywire. If we have complete surveillance and control, political liberty goes out the window. It s not really that hard a question to answer. The answer is that you must migrate away from your thinking about transactions in terms of two parties and move toward three party transactions. That third party can be government but does not need to be.In a two party transaction it takes the mutual consent of both parties for the transaction to take place.P1 - No, P2 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes - Transaction happensIn one of four (25%) cases, the transaction takes place.Contrast that with three party transactions:P1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensIn 4 of 8 cases (50%), the transaction happens.Markets are INEFFICIENT because they rely predominantly on two party transactions.Samuelson and Fama are incorrect.FRestly, check your logic. In the two-party transaction example, in 1 of 4 combinations, 25%, a 2-way transaction occurs. In the three-party transaction example, in 1 of 8 combinations, 12.5%, a 3-way transaction occurs. The conclusions expressed in the penultimate and the ultimate sentences bear no relation to the examples given.OEE,Check your reading comprehension skills.In the three party transaction, I am relying on majority rule (2 votes out of 3) for the transaction to take place the same way that I am relying on majority rule in a two party transaction (2 votes out of 2). With three party transactions, that occurs in 50% of possible voting outcomes.The point is that there is a trade off between economic efficiency and economic freedom as illustrated by the example above.Two party transactions provide the most individual freedom but are the least economically efficient.Three party transactions sacrifice some economic freedom (you may vote no on a trade, but be outvoted) but are more economically efficient.Robert Mundell (your fellow Canadian) made a similar observation regarding currency exchanges here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_problemFRestly,My remarks referred to your statement: It s not really that hard a question to answer. The answer is that you must migrate away from your thinking about transactions in terms of two parties and move toward three party transactions. That third party can be government but does not need to be. “…transactions in terms of two parties…” are bi-lateral transactions, in the meaning of that term as it is used in the Wikipedia page cited.“…move toward three party transactions…” are tri-lateral transactions, in the meaning of that term as it is used in the Wikipedia page cited.Your examples all refer to bi-lateral arrangements ( transactions in terms of two parties ). If you are relying on bi-lateral arrangements to make your point in criticism of John Cochrane’s remarks, then my observation serves to point out that you have, in your enumerated examples, ignored “three party transactions”, i.e., A-B-C (tri-lateral) vs. A-B (bi-lateral).The Wikipedia page refers to currency trading pairs (bi-lateral) but notes that Mundell’s observation does not hold for currency trading triples (tri-lateral).I trust that this explanation will serve to clear up any misapprehension.OEE, Your examples all refer to bi-lateral arrangements (transactions in terms of two parties) Again, check your reading comprehension skills.From above:P1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 = Party #1P2 = Party #2P3 = Party #3In 4 of 8 cases (50%) IN THE THREE PARTY VOTING ARRANGEMENT, the transaction happens.Using the above:For two party transactions - 25% of potential trades take placeFor three party transactions - 50% of potential trades take placeIn an n good barter economy:For two party transactions there are n*(n-1)/2 combinations of two goods that can be tradedFor instance with goods A, B, C, and D there are the following combinations:AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD : Total of 6 combinationsFor three party transactions there are n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6 combinations of three goods that can be traded.For instance with goods A, B, C, and D there are the following combinations:ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD : Total of 4 combinationsIf we allow all possible trades to be voted on, then in a barter economy with two party transactions the average quantity of lots of goods that will be traded can be calculated as follows:2 * n*(n-1)/2 * 25% = n*(n-1)/4In a four good barter economy with two party transactions an average of 4*3/4 = 3 lots of goods will be traded.If we allow all possible trades to be voted on, then in a barter economy with three party transactions the average quantity of lots of goods that will be traded can be calculated as follows:3 * n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6 * 50% = n*(n-1)*(n-2)/4In a four good barter economy with three party transactions an average of 4*3*2/4 = 6 lots of goods will be traded.It should be obvious that n*(n-1)*(n-2)/4 is always greater than n*(n-1)/4.John, blocking bridges with trucks is not speech. Is the Canadian government trying to silence people, or are they trying to protect people s freedom to transact from disruptive behavior?Hopefully, if the executive branch abuses its power and silences protected speech, the judiciary will step in. If the Trump era has taught me anything, it s the importance of an independent judiciary, a key protection for political liberty in a world where the government has complete surveillance and control of electronic transactions and everything else.Kenneth DudaMenlo Park, CACanada is a different kettle of fish. I don  think they really have an independent judiciary. Here in teh US most judges are stooges of the Democrat-Progressives. Earl Warren s SCOTUS showed us that judges are mere autocratic bureaucrats in black robes, effectively a second unelected legislature relying on sentimental fools to stay in power. The current judicial  system  in the US reminds me of the last days of the Parlements of France under the Ancient Law of France--which got abolished during the Revolution and replaced with the Code Napoleon. The Restored Bourbons in 1815 kept the Code Napoleon and the revised courts; the old Parlements were premanently gone. Read  The Black Count  to get some feel in passing what the Ancient Law of France was like in practice--one of its Maxims was  There are no slaves in France . The First Republic for a few months even tried to make slavery legal in Revolutionary France!Superb comment, John. Those of us who warned about  soft totalitarianism  on the campuses of the 1990 s are seeing our fears realized. It is important to note the  finer points  of the strategy employed by Mr. Trudeau. His minister is threatening to freeze bank accounts of those connected with the trucker protest, but the minister refuses to specify how many accounts, or what criteria would be employed. Moreover, one article stated that lists would be turned over to banks, and it would be the banks  responsibility to determine who would be frozen. This allows Mr. Trudeau to evade responsibility, while terrorizing anyone who might disagree with him. Cost-conscious bank executives might decide to simply cancel the accounts of anyone on the list. Mr. Trudeau missed a golden opportunity to bring Canadians together by (a) meeting openly with the truckers, and (b) finding a compromise solution. Anyone marginally more competent than our current U.S. President could have done this easily.This comment has been removed by the author.This is the first I ve heard of runs on banks, which I thought would be all over the place after the government promised to  do more.  Either it s not happening much or the news of it is seriously being squelched? (Or I m not reading the right news sources, also a very likely possibility.)Remember, the other reason why governments license businesses and individuals (besides revenues) is this gives them control over your livelihood and the ability for you to provide for your family. This is incredible leverage and just what they want. Maybe so. But the alternative is anarchy, which in its purest form is severe idealism: that people can self-monitor their behavior and the natural by-product is everyone gets along and there are no violations of property or to others. Uh-huh. Maybe it s possible in a 2 person society, but even Adam and Eve had issues.Mark,See above: This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto. If we have arbitrary, cheap, completely anonymous transactions, tax evasion, theft (ransomware), fraud, can go haywire. If we have complete surveillance and control, political liberty goes out the window. Professional licensing provides a level of accountability with the veil of anonymity lifted. Do you really want a doctor using a pseudonym performing surgery on you or a lawyer using a phony name representing you in court?Mykel, Maybe it s possible in a 2 person society, but even Adam and Eve had issues. Adam and Eve had God around (3rd party).If I were a Canadian I would be looking to migrate, quickly. Just where to go?It certainly wouldn t hurt Oz to inherit a few freedom lovers, with a backbone. Ours could use a bit of reinforcing about now.John, I think what you mean in this sentence is “privately”, not “anonymously” :“And the right to transact, freely and anonymously. If the government can monitor your transactions, freeze your assets,  sanction  you, or freeze your ability to transact, to buy or sell anything, it can quickly silence you, stop your political participation, undermine political movements or even aspiring individual politicians.” Anonymity has never been a right. Privacy, or even secrecy, has a much stronger foundation.In digital tech this is a big difference. A big part of the problem with today’s digital structures is anonymity.Digital privacy is an achievable goal but it does require a validation authority. Unless one believes in a world without passports, there needs to be a way to establish identity beyond a reasonable doubt. Creating that value also enables privacy because it enables individuals to encrypt their data with their digital identity.The state has a unique role in strengthening citizen freedom through private validation of identity. That will need to be recreated in the digital realm to deliver the same value in the digital as exists in the physical.This is a very good point. The best I can come up with are private payments processors, backed by treasurys or reserves, that maintain customer privacy. Government can search with a warrant, and immense legal protections. An imperfect middle, to be sure. Maybe this will help crypto go more mainstream. I am Canadian, and while I didn’t donate to the Convoy, I almost did. I have donated to other causes (generally free speech related) that the current uber-woke Canadian government might find ‘offensive.’ So I would like to move my money out of Canadian banks. Crypto is attractive for that reason—but solely for that reason. I do not want to speculate in crypto, and the less I need to learn about it the better. I just want to use it as a medium term store of value that is safe from the Cdn gov’t, ideally with a rate of return that is comparable to what I can earn in standard mutual funds, or a bit lower as the cost of security from government. If someone sets up that institution, there will be a lot of takers. (If it is already possible, please point me in the right direction.)Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

And where could such Fed strong-arm tactics end? “The Federal Reserve does not engage in credit allocation” Sarah Bloom RaskinWrong!

A false premise on which to build an argument.It s interesting to watch pretzel logic contort itself into the Fed s dual mandate. Disorderly price adjustments a fancy way of saying price instability? It s creative on the surface, and while I agree that maintaining the environment is a good thing for long term basic needs stability, the Fed just doesn t have the right tools for this. Thanks John, great post.Best question of the day:  If  markets  aren t  valuing  green investments correctly, isn t it remotely possible that they are valuing them too much? But  central planners of the economy  do not understand their own limited knowledge horizon, and their power assures us their guessing-mistakes will hurt the evolving economy much more severely. The Social Cost becomes gigantic from the illusion of  planning.  Why not just boost the capital requirements of the coddled bankers (with access to the Fed).It s strange how people do not realize how ironic this affirmation is, as you did. How can one not sarcastically propose that the fed is better at evaluating risk than the whole of the financial sector? And if you believe this how can you be against revolving doors? We need those fed magicians working at the banks!Given the point of the Fed is to disrupt the proper functioning of financial markets, perhaps they are best positioned to foresee such risks?One of the ways the Fed adds money into the economy is by losing alpha.John, I should have added: there is no such thing as an orderly price adjustment.

If we had vax rates close to that of Denmark or Portugal, the number of deaths would be much lower. The current number is heartbreaking, as is the suffering of the families left behind. I don t know how diluted the focus on the vaccines has been by policies on masking, testing, etc. Things are not mutually exclusive, so I think the effect has been minimal and vaccines remain front and center of the public health strategy. Of course, the focus on vaccines could be even clearer, but not sure hesitancy would be lower with more aggressive efforts on that front. And at least we do not have people in positions of power at the Federal level questioning the efficacy of the vaccines. That would have been a bigger problem given how effective vaccines remain. Cheers.Seems like every nation ends up losing against Covid-19. Testing, testing, vaccinations, lockdowns, no lockdowns, masks what have you, it all ends up in the same place.If I am doing my math correctly, the latest strains of Omicron are 200 times more infectious than the original virus. And who knows, perhaps even more infectious variants are on the horizon.Covid-19 strikes me as the public health sector s Vietnamistan.Some wars you lose.Ironically, when one clicks on the embedded web page at the start of the blog article, a new web page is generated that displays the following message:Bad RequestError 400Intentional or not, the message is appropriate as either a judgement on the administrations policy, or a warning to the reader seeking information directly from the original source.The top of page correct paywall link to The Wall Street Journal Article,  The High Cost of ‘Free’ Covid Testing Insurance has to pay for it, with no limits.

Sorry to be slow on this. I kept thinking the comments were going to another post and couldn t figure out the problem. Now fixed. Why am I not surprised? It has always been and will remain that someone s need will be someone else s opportunity. You also make clear the point that, in the end, it is the consumer/taxpayer who foots the ultimate bill. If we want cheaper health care, someone s ox will need to be gored. Either consumers will need to accept a lower (less costly) standard of care, or health care providers, pharmaceutical companies, etc., will need to earn less. Without serious federal government action, it seems unlikely that the cost side of health care will fall anytime soon.The pandemic has also made clear that our current health care system operates on a  just in time  service basis. It works as long as the demand is not too high, but in the case of a broad based emergency, that model can quickly break down.Could be time to go with herd immunity. (Trump was right.) With the less deadly viruses, especially. And if unvaccinated folk perish, it was time to cull the herd of stoopid Libertarian Republicans, in any event. In France a PCR test is free for the citizen (you don t even need to bring a payment method) and the lab charges 40euros to the state.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments.

Sure, my libertarian friends, the federal government shouldn t be doing any of this and we should have universal real time tolling..... but I m writing here about the system we have. Elections have consequences. You could even go so far as to say that political parties have utility functions, and describe the utility functions based on policy choices they make. You might even observe that politics is about divying up the pork in the  pork-barrel . Indeed, you could draw on an old aphorism that dates from the Era of Trusts, to observe of today s  progressives ,  If you can t buy [or, brow-beat and bully] a congresswoman, what good is she? The real failing is not on the side of the democratic party senator or representative, but it is on the side of the republican party senator or representative who falls for the con.In the parlimentary model of govenance, to be on the opposition side of the aisle is to oppose the government at each and every instant and instance. The republican form of government seems to abhor such practices, focussing on cooperation, bi-partisanship, and other forms of compromise. The other side of that coin is the practice of wholesale turnover of the bureaucracy whenever there is a change of party in power, in conjunction with partisan political appointees up and down the civil list. You re-start from zero every four years. It s no way to run a railroad.You can do little about the form of governance, but you can do much about who is given the reins of power. The old adage,  Vote early, vote often , has its place in that pantheon.As to federal highway spending, the keys to the citadel have landed in the hands of those who disvalue rural communities, economic efficiency, and republican constituencies. Grin and bear it, for the time being. Your chance will come around, a.s.Dont worry Ill, along with plenty of voters, will vote often and democrat when were dead.Bring back earmarks. The executive branch cannot be trusted to pick good projects. Congressmen know what their constituents want. They should write into the legislation so that they don t get horsed around by bureaucratic dip wads like these.Personal automobiles are the most inefficient (particularly in terms of space) way of moving humans. Weird an economist would push for more of it when historically investment in it has been so lopsided compared to alternatives. Fix what we have, but if you re serious about moving people or goods, the the most rational electric vehicle investment for America would probably have an over head wire and run on steel tracks (trains, subways, trams).My car gets me door to door at any time I want. Public transit does not. Relative to its modal share, we spend far too much in transitBecause parking for private vehicles is severely underpriced. Private automobiles are essential for suburbs, and America s suburbs are the reason that the U.S. is not facing imminent demographic collapse, like Europe, Japan, China, etc. I found the original memo here. (WSJ, why do you not link to sources?) I ve long wondered why they don t. Journalists want us to trust them but I m a little low on trust these days. News reports that were footnoted and sourced would go a long way to enhance credibility. The federal and state governments collect about $40 billion a year in fuel taxes and transportation excise taxes. There are fewer than 180,000 miles of federal highways in the United States. That is more than $220k/year per mile of roadway. If half of that is channeled (diverted?) back to the states for local highways and roadways, that still leaves $110k per mile of federal highway. Reasonable estimates of annual maintenance of multilane highways are in the $25 to $30k per mile per year. That leaves more than $75k/year per mile of existing highway to pay for major repairs or replacement. Where did the money go? As an economist, I hope you reconsider your desire for widening un-priced vehicle travel lanes. You re surely smart enough to know the bulk of literature refutes additional road capacity being a way to  fix  congestion. As you are also smart enough to know, additional road capacity induces greater SOV travel demand, increases per-capita VMT, and harms the environment — which you as economist will understand is an unpriced externality in the current road pricing framework.Yes! I m all for real-time congestion-priced tolling everywhere. Roads are no longer public goods -- goods that you can t charge for. The Economic literature is full of papers offering impracticable suggestions and recommendations to policy makers.  Congestion-priced tolling  has been implemented on interstate highway I-405 that serves the eastern half of greater metropolitan Seattle, in the State of Washington. Policy doesn t enforce congestion pricing in all of the lanes of I-405. The state highway 520 is also tolled, but interstate highway I-90 is not.During the 1990s, Malaysia built a 4-lane tolled highway, and charged 20 Malaysian Ringgit per one-way trip from the International Airport to Kuala Lumpur. A beautifully designed modern roadway, it was hardly used. Instead, the alternative route from the International Airport into Kuala Lumpur was a heavily congested two-lane secondary highway that was the inefficient but untolled alternative that ran through densely built up urban areas. The cost in productive time lost, extra wages paid for time spent behind the wheel of lorries and taxis, and exhaust emissions were a consequence of government policy following the recommendations of the learned economists such as yourself. Those negative externalities were the result of govenment policy, and are referred to as uncompensated governmental negative externalities, you no doubt know. Blind application of economic theorists  theories is poor economic practice. A properly performed benefit-cost analysis would have led to levying the toll on the older highway to reduce externalities, and left the new highway untolled to encourage diversion of traffic from the older route to the newer more economically efficient route.I could not agree more. Elections have consequences. We have seen three elections where men who have not been fully vetted by the voter has succeeded in advancing to the Presidency. These men, each in their own way, reflect the decline of voter faith and trust in the Government to do what is right. The three of them are examples of what happens when the voter is engaged only to appear and cast a vote. Our Congress has failed to take up the fight for Freedom and has settled into counting their pension benefits paid for by you and me. It is a messy time for Democracy. Here s hoping. How do you knowv that yellow plastic crosswalks can be dangerous to bicyclists in the rain?I ride bicycles in the rain. What is the incentive for representatives to care about the national budget? People have debt-like exposure to the government, so nobody wants governments to earn a profit. As for public needs, these are subject to the tragedy of the commons. The obvious solution here is to elect and incent representatives the same way board members are.It s even worse than you say. In Houston, they are blocking a highway project that is fully funded by state money already allocated.It appears Congress failed to write a Conference Report or Legislative History. That failure impairs or obscures the intent of the text of the law which, in turn, leaves the Biden Executive Branch to interpret the law pretty much as they see fit even if it contravenes the understanding of some of the Republican legislators who voted for it.Absurd. Why did Republicans not condition their votes on the writing of a Conference Report?https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/textThis comment has been removed by the author.Hi professor. I think you are wrong here. Current research on the subject is quite clear that more highways don t solve traffic problems. Your third lane one the I-5 will not be a solution.If it were true that we are no better off with more highways, then we are no worse off with less highways. Blow them up. There won t be any more traffic jams! The logical flaw: Even if traffic does not improve, more people go places. You may disparage their desire to do so, but it s important to them. Actually the research is quite flawed -- blog post coming up. Its one of those things that everyone passes around, like you should drink 8 glasses of water a day, but turns out to be very fragile Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

By giving an answer pretty close to the actual yield curve, these forecasters are reporting a number close to the risk-neutral conditional mean, i.e. not \(\sum_s\pi(s)x(s)\) but \(\sum_s u [c(s)]\pi(s)x(s)\). The risk-neutral mean is a better sufficient statistic for decisions. Pay attention not only to how likely events are but how painful it is to lose money in those events. Don t be wrong on the day the firm loses a lot of money. The weather service also tends to overstate wind forecasts. I interpret the forecast of 30 mph winds as  if you go out and capsize your boat in a 30 mph gust, don t blame us.   If you buy bonds and they tank, don t blame us  surely has to be part of a finance industry  forecast.  nbsp; /p  p If the risk-neutral mean equals the market price, do nothing. And do nothing has to be the advice to the average investor. Reporting the forecast implied by the yield curve directly has a certain logic to it. nbsp; /p  p Economists rush too quickly, I think, from surveys where people are asked  what do you expect?  to bemoaning that the answers do not represent true-measure conditional means, and blaming that on stupidity. As if anyone who answers the question has the vaguest idea what the definitions of mean, median, mode, conditional and true vs. risk-neutral measure are. We might have a bit more humility: They re giving us a sensible answer, to a question posed in English, but since we asked the question in a  nbsp;foreign language, it is an answer to a different question. nbsp; /p  p (Teaching is good for you. Most of my students did not understand that  risk  can mean you earn more money than you  expected,  at the beginning of the class. I hope they got it by the end! But they were not wrong. In English,  risk  means downside risk. In portfolio analysis, it means variance. Know what words mean.) nbsp; /p  p But that also means, do not interpret the answers as true-measure conditional means! nbsp; /p  p This graph is particularly challenging since it concerns the 10 year rate only. Similar graphs of short-term rates also show consistent bias toward forecasting higher rates that don t happen. But that is more excusable as a risk-neutral mean, since the yield curve slopes up in the first few years. A rising forecast of 10 year yields corresponds to slope from 10 years to longer maturities, which is typically smaller. Torsten, if you re listening, a comparison to the forecast implied by the forward curve at each date would be really interesting! nbsp; /p  p  br /  /p  p *** /p  p Update: The same students who used the English meaning of  risk  to be  downside risk  also used the English meaning of  expected  to be  what happens if nothing goes wrong,  somewhere in the 90th percentile. The two meanings do make some sense, properly understood, especially in a world with skewed distributions -- the lion gets you or does not, the plan crashes or does not, the bomb explodes or does not. Many important distributions are not normal, so mean and variance aren t appropriate! nbsp; /p  p I don t mean to say that surveys are useless. They are very important data, that can be very useful for forecasting events. If the survey forecast points up, that tells you something. A forecasting regression that includes survey data can be very useful. Just don t interpret it directly as conditional mean and blather about irrationality if it isn t. nbsp; /p  p The variation across people in survey forecasts is the really interesting and under-studied part of all this. The graph is the average forecast across forecasters. But individual forecasters say wildly different things. Even these, who are professional forecasters. Why do survey forecasts vary across people so much, though the people have the same information? Why do trading positions not vary over time or across people anything like the difference between survey forecasts and market prices says they should? I think we re missing the interesting part of surveys -- their heterogeneity, with little heterogeneity of actions. nbsp; /p  p  br /  /p  p  br /  /p  p  nbsp; /p </description>

By giving an answer pretty close to the actual yield curve, these forecasters are reporting a number close to the risk-neutral conditional mean, i.e. not \(\sum_s\pi(s)x(s)\) but \(\sum_s u [c(s)]\pi(s)x(s)\). The risk-neutral mean is a better sufficient statistic for decisions. Pay attention not only to how likely events are but how painful it is to lose money in those events. Don t be wrong on the day the firm loses a lot of money. The weather service also tends to overstate wind forecasts. I interpret the forecast of 30 mph winds as  if you go out and capsize your boat in a 30 mph gust, don t blame us.   If you buy bonds and they tank, don t blame us  surely has to be part of a finance industry  forecast.  If the risk-neutral mean equals the market price, do nothing. And do nothing has to be the advice to the average investor. Reporting the forecast implied by the yield curve directly has a certain logic to it. Economists rush too quickly, I think, from surveys where people are asked  what do you expect?  to bemoaning that the answers do not represent true-measure conditional means, and blaming that on stupidity. As if anyone who answers the question has the vaguest idea what the definitions of mean, median, mode, conditional and true vs. risk-neutral measure are. We might have a bit more humility: They re giving us a sensible answer, to a question posed in English, but since we asked the question in a  foreign language, it is an answer to a different question. (Teaching is good for you. Most of my students did not understand that  risk  can mean you earn more money than you  expected,  at the beginning of the class. I hope they got it by the end! But they were not wrong. In English,  risk  means downside risk. In portfolio analysis, it means variance. Know what words mean.) But that also means, do not interpret the answers as true-measure conditional means! This graph is particularly challenging since it concerns the 10 year rate only. Similar graphs of short-term rates also show consistent bias toward forecasting higher rates that don t happen. But that is more excusable as a risk-neutral mean, since the yield curve slopes up in the first few years. A rising forecast of 10 year yields corresponds to slope from 10 years to longer maturities, which is typically smaller. Torsten, if you re listening, a comparison to the forecast implied by the forward curve at each date would be really interesting! ***Update: The same students who used the English meaning of  risk  to be  downside risk  also used the English meaning of  expected  to be  what happens if nothing goes wrong,  somewhere in the 90th percentile. The two meanings do make some sense, properly understood, especially in a world with skewed distributions -- the lion gets you or does not, the plan crashes or does not, the bomb explodes or does not. Many important distributions are not normal, so mean and variance aren t appropriate! I don t mean to say that surveys are useless. They are very important data, that can be very useful for forecasting events. If the survey forecast points up, that tells you something. A forecasting regression that includes survey data can be very useful. Just don t interpret it directly as conditional mean and blather about irrationality if it isn t. The variation across people in survey forecasts is the really interesting and under-studied part of all this. The graph is the average forecast across forecasters. But individual forecasters say wildly different things. Even these, who are professional forecasters. Why do survey forecasts vary across people so much, though the people have the same information? Why do trading positions not vary over time or across people anything like the difference between survey forecasts and market prices says they should? I think we re missing the interesting part of surveys -- their heterogeneity, with little heterogeneity of actions.  As it was explained to me: forward curves allow you to bet against the consistency of your counterparty s trades, not their accuracyFor the last 40 years, the macroeconomics profession has expected higher rates of inflation, thus higher nominal interest rates. Instead, we saw disinflation and lower rates.The last year has been most welcome in the profession.“The risk-neutral mean is a better sufficient statistic for decisions” is there a resource for a formal theory of sufficient statistics (including risk neutral means) in decision theory? Or are you using sufficient statistic loosely?Would be interesting to see this graph over a long period of rising interest rates. This comment has been removed by the author.The 10 yr bond interest rate forecasts are available for analysis at:https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/tbondThe forecasts of the individual forecast professionals can be downloaded as an Excel file. Mean and median statistics are also available in Excel format but, as summary statistics, these measures are less useful for purposes of analysis of forecasting accuracy, e.g., (expected minus actual)/actual.Forecasts are given by calendar quarter, enabling analysis of dynamic recalibration by individual forecaster. The result is greater  color  in the data available to the data analyst.Torsten Slok s remark is hardly newsworthy. Forecasts are usually taken with a grain of salt. It is not the mean, or the median, forecast that is useful, but the individual forecaster whose forecasting ability has demonstrated a consistent record of accuracy that is worth listening to. Find that individual or handful of individuals and pay attention to their estimates and expressed expectations. The forecast survey data, not the statistical measures, is the critical information.This is a GREAT graph and great post. I have grabbed this chart and shared it with friends on numerous occasions whenever we speak of inflation/rates and they go into...but the market isn t expecting...Broader question - what does a chart say about standard economic theories that depend on correct long-run expectations - should we still be making predictions based on P=E[mX] when  E  can be so screwed up for so long....? Of course we can re-classify the mistake into  the required rate of return  but that seems so unappealing. I think you are missing the point: long run expectations are already embedded in the price, but that price also embeds the cost of risk. You can t distill true expectations unless you have a perfect pricing model that can calculate the price of risk. As a shorthand, media and market participants refer to  market expectations  all the time. Knowingly or not, those are only pseudo expectations, accurate solely in a risk neutral world. Forecasters, intriguingly, seem to do the same thing. Very interesting graph. When I was at Booth I did a paper on market sentiment/forecasters and correlation with the following periods of market movement. It was focused on the short term in commodity markets, but sentiment was generally correlated well with the previous period--recent rally, expect more of the same. The only forecasters with good records were forecasters in markets with positive serial correlation (long trends). This  broken clock syndrome  is interesting in the long run. And I ve had my issues with the wind forecasts from NOAA as well. As a devout windsurfer, I grew frustrated with the forecasts always well above the measured windspeeds. I even did an unscientific study and contacted NOAA about the perils of crying wolf. No reply, but forecasts today are much more accurate than in the past. https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/media/Lehrstuehle/vwl/Adam/AdamMatveevNagel_JME.pdfThis JME paper shows quite convincingly that your explanation of risk-neutral or pessimistically-tilted expectations cannot be correct.

The right answer would seem to be, if you are not vaccinated, health insurance will adjust your premiums, as they do for smokers. Why must higher premiums for unvaccinated people be illegal? Good points. I m particularly I m favor of vaccines and got all the required shoots. However, I don t really blame the average Joe if he doesn t want to take the vaccine because he doesn t trust the public health  experts . I mean, come on, besides all the points you talked about we still had: WHO being against masks, WHO saying that in cooperation with Chinese officers they found no evidence of human to human transmission (I even have print screens from their tweets), hundreds (HUNDREDS!) of epidemiologists signing a letter saying that BLM protests, in the most critical moment of the pandemic, were necessary and presented no significant risk of transmission.Those are all valid reasons for being angry with public health officials and thinking the CDC and the WHO need radical overhauls. They are not reasons for refusing to take the vaccine. The germ theory of disease is real. The disease is likely to be transmitted through the air - in which case masks and social distancing are prudent. At this point there have been so many hundreds of millions of vaccine doses given that the safety and efficacy should be readily apparent whether or not you would trust the CDC or the WHO to tell you the time of day. It makes no sense to say  the CDC lied to me at the start when they downplayed the seriousness so they must be lying and exaggerating the seriousness now.  COVID vaccines: The COVID vaccines have killed tens of thousands of people and injured hundreds of thousands of people (https://openvaers.com/covid-data). More people have died from the COVID vaccines than from all of the other vaccines combined since 1997. And the vaccinated are not protected from getting or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and dying from COVID (see Belgium, Israel, UK, Iceland, Ireland, Singapore, Gibralter, etc., all highly vaccinated countries), so what is he point of the vaccines especially if they weaken our immune systems and make us more likely to have complications and die from COVID?https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/new-big-data-study-of-145-countries - New big data study of 145 countries show COVID vaccines makes things worse (cases and deaths). The study found that the COVID vaccines cause more COVID cases per million (+38% in US) and more deaths per million associated with COVID (+31% in US).https://popularrationalism.substack.com/p/in-the-united-states-vaccination - James Lyons-Weiler recently showed that the US state data shows that the more we vaccinate, the higher the # of COVID cases.https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19843315.covid-scotland-case-rates-lowest-unvaccinated-double-jabbed-elderly-drive-rise-hospital-admissions/ - COVID Scotland: Case rates lowest in unvaccinated as double-jabbed elderly drive rise in hospital admissions.According to Dr. Robert Malone: A statement out of Israel reports a nosocomial outbreak involving 16 healthcare workers, 23 exposed patients and two family members. The source was a fully vaccinated COVID-19 patient. The vaccination rate was 96.2% among all 248 exposed individuals (151 healthcare workers and 97 patients). Out of the 248 people, fourteen fully vaccinated patients became severely ill or died, and two unvaccinated patients developed mild diseaseMasks: The COVID-19 virus is tiny and most masks are ineffective at stopping the virus because the diameter of coronavirus — is 0.13 microns (a micron is 1,000 times smaller than a millimeter). The best N95 standard mask only filters down to 0.3 microns, therefore the masks are ineffective in stopping transmission of COVID. Wearing a mask is like putting up a chain link fence to stop mosquitos. I think most people know that masks are useless for stopping COVID and masks are harmful for socializing, learning, breathing, peer interaction, and masks are devastating for autistic and deaf children. Masks can also cause bacterial and fungal infections, etc. Even the CDC and former FDA director Scott Gottlieb said masks do not stop coronaviruses.And, according to a study by Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University (https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2031), young children showed a 22-point drop in IQ (IQ dropped from 100 to 78 - therefore children went from average intelligence (100 IQ) to retarded (78 IQ). The 22-point drop in IQ in young children is because the masks, lockdowns, and social distancing, etc., cause a lack of stimulation from peers, parents, grandparents, etc.Solution: There are over 213 million people in Nigeria but less than 3,200 COVID deaths. Could the Nigerians have a low death rate (.0001) from COVID because they take hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) daily to prevent malaria? Could therapeutics/medications (combination of ivermectin, Fluvoxamine, and Methylprednisolone along with HCQ/Quercetin, zinc, vitamin D3 and C, as well as monoclonal antibodies) be the answer to treating/curing COVID?No one needs to die from COVID if we use medications and therapeutics like the ones listed above for prevention and early treatment, and if we encourage people to keep their weight in check, exercise, and eat and sleep well.Aye, Aye!I am unhappy with the quality of most public health guidance and believe they should have been better. On the other hand there seem to be legions of bad faith actors perfectly happy to seize on anything they can to get their own piece of the public attention. Some of those bad faith actors are in politics and some are in the media and some are trying to establish followings on social media. To say that immunity acquired by having had Covid gives better protection than getting the vaccine is meaningless, or worse, if you are 1,000 times more likely to die from having Covid than from getting the vaccine. When you have been deluded it s really hard to accept reality. Good luck with that.COVID has a 99% survival rate for those under age 70, and not recognizing natural immunity and early treatment has let to disastrous outcomes and deaths.Drs Ioannidis   Axfors at Stanford - survival rate for COVID Age Infection Survival Rate0-19 99.9973%20-29 99.986%30-39 99.969%40-49 99.918%50-59 99.73%60-69 99.41%70+ 97.6% (non-inst.)70+ 94.5% (all)https://brownstone.org/articles/natural-immunity-and-covid-19-twenty-nine-scientific-studies-to-share-with-employers-health-officials-and-politicians/ - 30 peer reviewed scientific studies showing the protection and longevity of natural immunityIf, per Fauci, everyone will get omicron/COVID, regardless of vaccination status, masks, social distancing, etc., then we can abolish all COVID restrictions and stop the vaccine mandates?89% of Covid-19 deaths in the UK are among the fully vaccinated, which proves this is a ‘pandemic of the fully vaccinated’ and suggests the vaccinated are more likely to die. The fully vaxed are the ones filling up hospitals in the US and in other countries.The COVID vaccines do not prevent the vaccinated from getting and/or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and/or dying from COVID? Why mandate ineffective vaccines when there are highly effective therapeutics/medications (Ivermectin, nitazoxanide, proxalutamide, Fluvoxamine, azithromycin, Methylprednisolone, spironolactone, dutasteride, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Quercetin/HCQ, and zinc) as well as Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody therapy to treat COVID and prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and/or death. Because the CDC thinks we re morons and can t understand that, so it must suppress evidence of natural immunity to scare people into vaccination. The CDC can protect itself by pointing to numbers of vaccinations. Natural immunity does nothing for the CDC. It s all quite rational.What bothers me personally is only their brazenness. Excellent blogging. The war on Covid-19 has become the public health sector s Vietnamistan.The issue aren t false beliefs like anti vax that go against  expert  or  elite  opinion. The FAR more worrisome issue are the patently false beliefs of the elite and  experts  themselves, on issues such as sexual identity, race, criminology, psychometrics, etc. These drive actual policy impacting almost every aspect of governance from education, immigration, welfare, taxation, police enforcement, sentencing, etc. And they repeatedly get it wrong and double down on insanity. I ll gladly take some populistic dumb takes over that. There is a good point here. Every lie undermines every truth. When public health authorities ration vaccines to  redress historic inequities,  as they did in California, then people use that information when deciding whether their current advice has scientific merit. And people don t necessarily appreciate the fine lines between bureaucracies as we do. Every bit of fantastical spin by Washington politicians and bureaucrats undermines trust in the occasional quite reasonable pronouncement by other Washington politicians or bureaucrats. After the boy cried wolf too many times, they also ignore the girl who cries wolf when the real wolf appears. I agree. Whether they like it or not, all  experts  are part of a meta-guild of  experts . Their credibility is held jointly. If they had a code of ethics, one of the rules would be  Nothing false . Anyone in any field who undermines trust does so across the board. It s not fair or logical; it s the way people respond. As it becomes clear that vaccines do not stop transmission  Could you please qualify this statement to make clear that vaccines do not *fully* stop transmission, but they reduce transmission, both through preventing many infections altogether and by reducing viral load among those who do get infected despite vaccination.Oh like the US Naval vessel that was quarantined last week? Everyone on board was fully vaccinated but 236 plus crew members came down with the Wuhan.This comment has been removed by the author. I tried to get a booster in September and ran in to forbidden. Before it became mandatory. I could tell the same story, except that my brother is an experienced pulmonary physician. He coached me on the magic words to use to get around the bureaucratic barrier.Not to put too fine a point on it, but, I lied and got my booster. I don t feel bad about it.In the referenced study cited at the WSJ, do the authors control for hospitalization of previously infected people? Ex-ante, I am not surprised that previously infected people have lower chances of being hospitalized because they have proved to have good immunity to survive the first time they were exposed to the virus. Also, even if they control for previously hospitalizations, my assumption is that these people would be more careful after coming out of the hospital, so even if they get re-infected perhaps the viral load is low because they have been more careful. Am I missing something? I agree that vaccination remains the safest public health strategy. We are ok there. We may also agree that, current lies or not, vaccination remains the most important or a key part of the strategy, so I am ok to accept the noise (lies, mishaps, miscommunication, etc). While data on reinfection rates and more transparency (now, in the past and future) should be expected, the focus on vaccination may be more effective than a plethora of measures that may muddy the waters, especially for the average folk  doing their research . So, while the overall approach of government agencies should feature more transparency regarding data, the public policy strategy should focus on the most effective tools, or tool in this case.  Get vaccinated and wear a mask when indoors  is not much of an ask frankly, and it is a clear line. Whether  the CDC  thinks we re morons is a bit besides the point frankly. Most of us have cognitive/information processing limitations (kids  homework, bills to pay, other health issues, etc) and a simple line that is adjusted in line with the preponderance of evidence is called for; do the vaccines remain the best tool? Yes. Any reason not to wear better masks indoor? No. Recalibrate type of mask in public communication. Boosters needed? Add that  Get vaxxed, get boosted . Rinse and repeat. Mistakes will be made. Has the focus on vaccines waned? No. Good then. Again, regardless of whether  the CDC  thinks we are morons. We should continue to review the experience, including in 2020 to learn and incorporate lessons going forward. Same with natural immunity. But only add to broader public policy strategy if there is a clear message with positive payoffs. The fact that 15 thousand people are expected to die over the next week when vaccines are widely available, indicates that there are morons out there. I wager that they are not  doing their own research  on the cost and benefits of natural immunity - instead they watch a certain set of TV channels and worship a few personalities (there are data on that, don t take my word for it). And nothing wrong with that, this is a free country. I hope the unvaccinated stay safe, don t get sick, and wish they would join smokers in my health insurance plans. But none of the above change the fact that public policy is largely appropriate as it continues to focus on the the best available tool to reduce hosp/mortality: vaccines. If there is confusion about masks and boosters, no need to add new guidance or recommendations focused on natural immunity. More, not less, of a KISS approach is needed here. Parsimony and common sense should not be underrated. Cheers. Our hospitals would not have to treat anyone with COVID, whether vaxxed or not, if the medical community would emphasize early treatment with therapeutics/medications (Ivermectin, nitazoxanide, proxalutamide, Fluvoxamine, azithromycin, Methylprednisolone, spironolactone, dutasteride, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Quercetin/HCQ, and zinc) as well as Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody therapy to treat COVID and prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and/or death.Why have we lost our collective minds and constitutional rights over a virus that has a 99% plus survival rate for those under age 70? Why would anyone require proof of vaccination when the vaccines do not prevent the vaccinated from getting and/or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and/or dying from COVID? https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/new-big-data-study-of-145-countries - New big data study of 145 countries show COVID vaccines makes things worse (cases and deaths).

This approach is only warranted when: 1. You actually know what s best 2. The population could never comprehend the truth. Neither is true here.This highlights why there needs to be a division between topic-expertise can policy formation. The best doctors will fail to formulate optimal policy when they don t get economics or statistics, or have incentive to balance the various needs of the population. I agree that the CDC should be more open with its data and that many public experts have done a terrible job. However, I doubt this is responsible for much of the vaccine hesitancy we are seeing. The posts I see my family post on facebook about the vaccine are about autism or the naive belief that because vaccines don t prevent infection they don t work at all. These people wouldn t take the vaccine even if the CDC had been more transparent. I d also argue that refusing to treat the unvaccinated is inhumane if there aren t enough resources to go around. If there s one hospital bed and two people -- one who reduced the risk of Covid and the other who chose not to -- the former should be the one to get it in my view. I d agree that unvax premiums should be legal though :)It is the vaxxed who are ending up in the hospitals sick and dying from COVIDhttps://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/new-big-data-study-of-145-countries - New big data study of 145 countries show COVID vaccines makes things worse (cases and deaths).

Why mandate ineffective vaccines when there are highly effective therapeutics/medications (Ivermectin, nitazoxanide, proxalutamide, Fluvoxamine, azithromycin, Methylprednisolone, spironolactone, dutasteride, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Quercetin/HCQ, and zinc) as well as Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody therapy to treat COVID and prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and/or death.Another egregious example is the Proximal Origins paper in Nature Communications in which several prominent virologists argued that “we do not believe that any type of laboratory based scenario is plausible,” even though FOIAed emails reveal that several of them had privately expressed the view that a natural original was unlikely only days before writing the paper: eg Garry said “I just can’t figure out how this [gain of function] gets accomplished in nature.” Fauci was in on those emails. The Proximal Origins paper apepars to have been written under pressure from Fauci and Collins. The 11 January letter from the Oversight Committee has details. We’ll start trusting the experts when they start being trustworthy. I won’t be holding my breath: apparently Fauci was on the radio just this week saying a lab leak is very unlikely. It’s really just insane behaviour — they seem to be actively doing their best to destroy trust in science.https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Letter-Re.-Feb-1-Emails-011122.pdfThis comment has been removed by the author.It is my understanding that vaccines reduce your odds of infection and also reduce the amount of time that you are infectious. Also, they do both of these reductions better if you get 2 doses rather than 1 one. Also, better if you get 3 doses rather than 2.The public discourse is too often in boolean statements when probabilities statements would be more accurate. This certainly undermines the trust of the public.Adjustment of health insurance premiums is the sensible response in the US, but obviously isn t possible in countries with a public health system, i.e., most of them. In principle, the same thing could be achieved via a surcharge or tax, but this would be administratively cumbersome and of doubtful effectiveness. In such circumstances, some kind of quantity rationing in health may be the only feasible response. Far from  inhuman , that would seem to be a far kinder, and more directly consequential, policy than depriving people of their careers, social circles, and ability to access all kinds of services. Inflation!Why isn t anyone listening? Why do so many Americans believe crazy things? Maybe not  crazy,  but beliefs that wildly get wrong factual costs and benefits, such as those of vaccines? It does not help that they have been lied to, over and over again. Why should they believe anything now? Our elites, and in particular our public health bureaucrats, though invoking the holy name of  science,  have been trying to massage public psychology via deliberate obfuscation for a few years now. There is little science of managing public psychology, and if there is, epidemiologists don t have it. There is some good ancient wisdom, as codified in the story of the boy who cried wolf. We do know that when lies are exposed, when elites are shown to be disparaging and trying to manipulate average people, trust erodes.Anxieties regarding the  management  of the public has been around a good long time. Plato s The Republic is a lamentation about the end of idealism. His position that the philosophers (the elite) should run the city-state was rooted in a severe mistrust of the public. Machiavelli  modernized  his position and it became about how to manipulate the public as so to prevent instability/chaos.Point is, there has been a long history of distrust of the public, for it s the belief that they cannot manage their affairs properly, and thus, it needs to be chosen for them. Remember that  The Prince  was rewritten by Hobbes in  The Leviathan,  and Locke would later rewrite it for his cultural epoch during the Rationalist Enlightenment, which heavily influenced the Founding Fathers. Even Jefferson had a severe mistrust of the public.This is nothing new, but it wrestles with the problem that in the end, people just don t like being told what to do. Freedom only exists in a confined, pre-determined structure. Michel Foucault s  Madness and Civilization  isn t really about mental health: it s about how society has a built in immune system to remove and isolate those that do not fit into recognizable society or refuse to adhere to  established norms. I suppose this goes to the idea of  useful myths.  The problem arises when the veil is pierced and there s a swamp of contradictory data and opinions lurking beneath. I am fully-vaccinated and boostered based on my personal situation and risk assessment. I consider the broad resistance to all vaccines a tragedy but it should be obvious that shame, insults and coercion build resentment and make the problem of vaccine resistance worse. Sure, if sweet reason would work that is preferable. If appeals to the common good would work, that would be preferable. In my case, I have a couple of young adult children who were vaccine hesitant until the British Columbia government said:  if you want to go to a bar or restaurant then you need to vaccinated ; at which point they got vaccinated. But the aggressive anti-vaxxers who seize on any quibble or nuance and treat it as a complete rebuttal are not susceptible to reason so we are left with:  get vaccinated or stay away from us . We are at a point where soon we will start lifting more restrictions but that is just because the number of unvaccinated has declined to the point where the hospitals and morgues will be able to handle the extra cases. Common good —- interesting. Whose common good? You NEVER sacrifice personal liberty and freedom for the collective good —- that is the mantra of communism. I will not take this vaccine and not because I’m an anti-vaxxer. By the designers’ own admission, it’s not a vaccine. Vaccines PREVENT acquisition of said disease. This SHOT guarantees nothing, except a less severe case of a disease with over a 99% survival rate. Also, numerous scientific reports show that 4 times as many spores were present in vaccinated people. Here is the foundational problem of lying and misleading humans: in order to maintain your illusion you have to censor all opposition or vilify any expert whose data contradicts your lie Another problem with dishonesty is that once your illusion in shown to be fiction you have two options: come clean or continue the narrative. World leaders, both medical and political, opted for the latter. Problem: the veil has been lifted. Too many reports, from over 149 countries including the US, show the VACCINATED ARE DYING AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE UNVACCINATED. Healthy young men dying of Myocarditis, women delivering stillborn children or miscarrying, extremely fit professional athletes dying of cardiac arrests —/ all after vaccination. These are not isolated nor unrelated. If we are saying science is driving the vaccine, then why aren’t these side effects from a “safe” vaccine being widely reported and investigated? None of the MSM has reported on this —- their job is to continue the narrative and they have the majority of the population as their viewing audience. All this aside, I find your rationale both disconcerting and cruel at best, and manipulative and hateful at its worse. If you research behaviors associated with Hitler’s brown shirts, you will find you share much of the bravado that made them a lethal medicine to Nazi opponents, and ultimately to the great nation of Germany. Their goal was also the COMMON GOOD of German people. Their tactics: first, propaganda. Next, coercion. Then, intimidation. Then, violence. Then, use of fellow Germans to isolate and betray their fellow man, and finally, death to any opposition. Forcing compliance for Common Good, however pure your paint your motives, eventually eradicates freedom and liberty for your opposition, and ultimately—- you. We ARE morons.Unfortunately, the WSJ article you cite is behind a paywall, but that s OK as I stopped reading their OpEds long ago.I suspect the CDC research they refer to is dated 1/19/22 and be reached at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm.Several thoughts struck me as I read the summary of findings on this study: 1) we knew nothing about Covid 19 and how to treat it when it first appeared. 2) our understanding of Covid 19, how it affects people and how to treat it, has constantly evolved since, especially as new variants have emerged, and 3) numerous mistakes by politicians and scientific communities along the way have only made things worse. Two years into the pandemic, its easy to claim that masks and lockdowns haven t made any difference, but that s a position impossible to defend as we simply don t know what the outcome would have been had we not taken these measures.The CDC article cited above does make clear that so-called  natural  immunity may, in fact, be stronger than that conferred through vaccination. However, and this cannot be underscored enough, natural immunity can only obtained through actually contracting the virus, which may lead to serious illness, hospitalization or death. Being vaccinated on the other hand, reduces the likelihood of being infected in the first place and if infected, can reduce the severity and mortality of being infected.The WSJ s article may suggest that natural immunity is better than that conveyed through vaccination, but the CDC s conclusion remains the same:  Initial infection among unvaccinated persons increases risk for serious illness, hospitalization, long-term sequelae, and death.....Thus, vaccination remains the safest and primary strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections, associated complications, and onward transmission.  However, and this cannot be underscored enough, natural immunity can only obtained through actually contracting the virus, which may lead to serious illness, hospitalization or death. Oh look - its our old friend selection bias. More specifically, survivorship bias. A reoccurring issue in the mutual fund performance literature. Thierry are six questions I have asked since the vaccine “push” began:1) Vaccine development and approval is a 7-10 year project —- based on all previous vaccines. How did this vaccine go from inception to injection in under a year??2) THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY— SCIENCE —- has always said natural immunity is the best. Yet before they,d even isolated the COVID 19 germ or developed a VALID, ACCURATE test, these “experts” were saying a vaccine was better than natural immunity. When did our immune systems stop doing their designated job of producing antibodies to disease? 3) I’ve never had vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough because many “boomers” had these diseases. only children that hadn’t had the disease received the vaccination and then 99.9% of them never got the disease and didn’t need a “booster” to maintain the immunity the vaccine provided. The COVID vaccine doesn’t prevent the disease. How can it be called a vaccine if it doesn’t prevent the disease it’s targeting?4) EVERY SARS VACCINE trial ended at ferret trials (COVID is. SARS variant.). A ferret’s immune system is most similar to a human’s. There were two side effects as each vaccine went through these trials: death and immune system response disorder, which usually resulted in death from another infection due to a compromised immune system. Why were ferret trials skipped and this vaccine rushed to humans?5) Once 10 deaths are tied to a vaccine it is pulled. Over 250 professional athletes have DIED from cardiovascular episodes shortly after receiving their vaccine. The information is out there. We’ve lost over 100 boys under age 17 with myocarditis—- 100 young men —- dead —- who are not even high risk. Hundreds of women have miscarried or their children were stillborn. All of them vaccinated. Why are these vaccines still being administered? 6) Whole populations, in this case, the world, have never been expected to be guinea pigs for experimental products, ie vaccines. Why is the world’s population being used as “ferrets” to test this experimental vaccine? And a final question, why did the Emergency Covid Act excuse Big Pharma from any financial responsibility due to injury or death from their products???Food for thought: these three Pharmaceutical Giants are expected to net trillions of dollars from their “vaccines”. Which begs one more question: Why would any government allow experimentation on their citizens, remove all liability from producer of said product, unless there was something for them?I’ve always believed you follow the money. If you think logically about the last two years and the lies and misinformation, a conclusion is very easy to draw. YOU CANT CLAIM SCIENCE IS YOUR IMPETUS FOR DECISIONS WHEN YOU DISPARAGE SCIENCE THAT PROVES YOUR HYPOTHESIS WAS WRONG AT ITS FOUNDATION AND CONTINUE TO MISINFORM THE PUBLIC WITHOUT EXPECTATION OF SOMETHING AT THE BACKSIDE OF THE CIRCUS OF FEAR YOU SET INTO MOTION.  How did this vaccine go from inception to injection in under a year?? For the same reason that the United States was able to go from virtually nothing to building 60,000 aircraft per year and large numbers of aircraft carriers after WWII started. The United States (and the world generally) has enormous intellectual, financial and industrial resources available to apply to an urgent problem. Brilliant!  You NEVER sacrifice personal liberty and freedom for the collective good  If Australians understood this point, life here would be a whole lot more bearable.niceComments are welcome.

		<text>John Cochrane s blog Not as bad as you might think. If that is the case, then a long-term investor really has not suffered any decline in long-run purchasing power. If your plan was to hold stocks for a long time, and effectively live off the dividends (including all cash flows), then nothing has changed. Sure, it would be better if you had gotten off your butt and sold ahead of the decline. But effectively market timing is difficult as a consistent strategy.

Maybe the Fed s forecasts are right that inflation will largely die out this year. Maybe not. Place your bets. Also, if you sell, you have to have the courage to jump back in just when it looks bleakest. Effectively market timing is difficult as a consistent strategy. Is this story right?

A long-term investor is not hurt. The value you get from selling all your stocks declines, but the cost of reestablishing the portfolio and living on it just declined too. Similarly, if the value of all houses falls, you really do not care to first order, since the value of the house you want to buy fell just as much as the value of the house you want to sell. Indeed, you save on property and capital gains taxes.  Just rephrasing your logic (which I find intuitive), long-term investors should care about cash flow news, but not really care about discount rate news. Here s an interesting extension to your analysis (well, interesting from my perspective): how should long-term investors care about their exposures to market neutral investment strategies (like value, momentum, etc.)? It s less obvious how the returns to these strategies break down into their  cash flow  and  discount rate  components. I think a Campbell   Vuolteenaho (2004) style decomposition would be helpful in understanding the recent moves in these strategies, and help long-term investors think about their exposures to these strategies (either implicitly or explicitly). I should have said  it s less obvious how _recent returns_ to these strategies break down into their... . Anyway, you get the idea. Long term investors should care about discount rates. Even in the, very theoretical, case that future cash-flows remain the same they would be  paying  a diferent price for exercicing the  flexibility  of moving these cash-flows around that markets of liquid assets provide.Let s imaging that I am a long term investor that has perfectly matched my future liabilities with the future dividend payments from my portfolio. Then unexpected liabilites come due (afterall live is what really happens while you are making wrong forecasts). I prefer to face those unexpected liabilities in the  December discount rate enviroment  rather than in the  last Monday discount rate enviroment , to be perfectly honest.Brilliant post. Thanks for sharing. Also,How should long term investors structure their liabilities relative to their assets?Note: We can t all be bankers, borrowing short to invest long. Prices being somewhat sticky, higher nominal interest rates will mean a higher real interest rate... Hmmm, if prices were so  sticky  then they should be sticky in both directions - up and down. So why did supposedly  sticky  prices rise to begin with?Frank, my thoughts on why  sticky  prices rose. Large scale asset purchases by the FED. (9 trillion now on its balance sheet). Real interest rates were zero or negative. How does this affect CAPM or 3 factor models? Low nominal rates pushed investors searching for yield into risky assets. With a rise in rates, markets decline. As an exercise, play with interest rates in a Dividend Discount Model (DDM). It gives an insight to this discussion. It is not clear that the Fed will raise interest rates so quickly. The time to be frugal is before borrowing before you spend it all on poker chips. Once the game is lost, and the debt is owed, frugality eats into utility much more severely. Mechanically, because of declining marginal utility to wealth, being frugal before borrowing is less painful than afterwards, unless you invested wisely rather than consuming. The US has found that it s  investment  in bailouts did not earn much in terms of long-run productivity. What should it do now? Our borrowing gambler has two choices: eat into wealth in a way that was more painful than before he borrowed, or defaulting. If the political will to be frugal or investing prowess was not present before borrowing, it is unlikely to be there afterwards.Thus, our gambler will almost certainly end up defaulting. The most painless way to default is via inflation, and that is most likely how this will go down. My guess is that the US tried to avoid inflation in 1929-1930 to avoid the mistakes of Germany a few years prior. What the US didn t realize is that massive defaults on debt generates more political instability than inflation. My vote would be the same here: Default on the debt via inflation. In the long run, the only way to avoid inflation is by avoiding a budget deficit. As long as you have a deficit, it s just a matter of when. Obviously, the advice to the US would be to run the Federal government profitably, but that is politically impossible given the incentives of voters and representatives.Clueless.As the sage said:  in the short run, the market is a voting machine, in the long run, the market is a weighing machine.  (attributed to Benjamin Graham)Unless you are a  professional voter  best to stick to the weighing machine strategies. Today s markets were fascinating from an intellectual standpoint. They went down at the start of the trading day, and continued in read only to recover and end up in green by the end of the day. Amazing. To me, this is a discount rate mechanism, which is what John (I believe) is suggesting in his post. But the come back we have seen at the end of the trading day seems to me more related to important players trying to cover their losses. Now, there are many news going on that are difficult to reconcile and that could potentially lead to cashflow story behind markets today (e.g., Ukraine-Russia war?). This comment has been removed by the author.I remember Larry Summers making a related point: that the increase in wealth in recent years has been accompanied by declining expected returns, leaving those with such wealth in pretty much the same place as they were before.Nice post. Some thoughts. Long term buy and hold tends to outperform actively managed portfolios. As an aside, my alpha as a hedge fund trader and manager was zero. Where on the long term horizon is the investor? If they are are 25, they have 40 years to build wealth with portfolios invested 100% in market ETF s. At age 65, they will have likely moved their holdings to about 60% cash. If some investors are truly rational, they will have bought in a declining market with a strategy such as, for every 5% market decline, they buy with 1% of their cash position. A 65 year old 60% in cash is seriously underestimating the risk that he might live to 90.People are over reacting to volatility. Since 1950 the S P 500 has spent ~50% of the time down more than 5% from the previous all time high and has averaged being down ~10% from the previous all time high. Anyone who is going to panic at a 10% drop has stumbled into the wrong bar. On a 10-12 years horizon, what the Fed does or doesn t do will have little influence on the stock market performance. Returns have been front loaded and the probability of positive real total return into 2032 are very low. I have written an article demonstrating why here:https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damiencleusix_uk-equity-markets-valuation-activity-6890281727840129024-QMc2/Comments are welcome.

		<text>John Cochrane s blog Portfolios for long-term investors  is published, Review of Finance 26(1), 1-42. (2022). This standard link works if you have institutional or individual access. I am not allowed to post a free access link here, but I am allowed to post one on my webpage where you will find it. The theme: How do we account for the vast gulf between portfolio practice and portfolio theory? How do we make portfolio theory useful given that the world has time-varying expected returns and time-varying returns and correlations? I argue for a view more focuses on prices and payouts, as a long-term bond investor should buy an indexed perpetuity and ignore one-period returns. I advise one to think about the market and equilibrium. The average investor must hold the market portfolio. Anything else is a zero sum game. So figure out why you are different than average. (If you think you re smarter than average, note that they think they re smarter than you.) The result encapsulates some ancient advice: Buy stocks for the dividends, broadly interpreted. Take risk you are well-positioned to take. If stocks have great value to other investors for reasons either technical (liquidity, short-sales constraints, etc.) or behavioral, avoid them. The paper grows out of the summary I used to give for MBA and PhD students. There aren t any equations, but there are lots of suggestions about how academic portfolio theory might be done better, and connect better to its intended audience. Thanks especially to Monika Piazzesi and Luis Viceira, who invited me to give the talk on which it is based, and Alex Edmans who shepherded it to publication. ******Update: I just found that the NBER has posted the original lecture videoThis is an important paper for RIA s looking to better justify their fees. So important, in fact, that I wrote a distilled version of the original keynote speech for RIAs (no, few read long papers or listen to long presentations): https://alphaarchitect.com/2021/07/08/leading-emh-economist-john-cochrane-advocates-for-advisor-fees/Sadly, the dynamics of the industry favor those with asset gathering skills rather than the ability to help smooth consumption. Most individual investors want to pay alms to their false prophets and in return be told how safe they are before they doze off to sleep. Those few willing to read and capable to understand John s blasphemy don t bother hiring advisors. Especially now that the Dimensional Fund Advisors  barn gates are open. Still, I m glad John is trying and happy to lend a hand. I should note, John certainly doesn t imply  fees are justified  and I admit as much (I had hoped) by calling my title click bait in the opening sentence. Very few advisors follow his advice and thus justify their fees.For the average individual, the following are likely to be the largest purchases over a lifetime:1. Primary residence2. Transporatation (personal vehicles)3. Energy4. Higher education5. Medical careDo any of these fall into the  long term asset portfolio  for investors?If you don t confine your assets to  financial assets  that have some promise to pay cash flows (and I think John does), you end of investing in NFTs and Crypto (or maybe Jackson Pollock paintings...not saying you can t eventually sell anything higher in the future). Plus, these non-financial assets on your list cover a liability (a place to live, need to get somewhere, live comfortably, converse intelligently, and avoid sickness) so can live outside of your portfolio. Not that you were really serious, but as John points out, all these assets are dwarfed by your own human capital (i.e., your ability to make your own cash flow). That asset is what needs the most tending to and arguably while value stocks that do poorly in a recession offer a risk premium. John, The paper grows out of the summary I used to give for MBA and PhD students. Do you tell those students they are wasting their (or their parents) money pursuing a higher education (MBA or PhD degree) and should instead be plowing that money into the stock / bond markets? Buy stocks for the dividends . What? Stock returns come from value appreciation, not dividends. If you own a $100 share of stock, and then there s a $5 dividend, then you own a $95 share of stock and $5 cash.This is a common and important fallacy. Short-run stock returns do come from value appreciation (or depreciation!) But the title is  for the long-run investor.  Value appreciation can only go so far. The price/earnings, or price/dividend ratio can only grow so far. Eventually, when price/earnings or price/dividend ratios run out of steam, the long-run return is completely dominated by the growth in dividends (including all cash payouts to investors.) Thanks for the response, but I disagree. I feel like you re neglecting share buybacks. Also, there s nothing stopping a company growing for hundreds of years, making profits and reinvesting them (or share buybacks if there are not growth opportunities).And again, dividends only come from value appreciation. A company can t give a $5 dividend unless they actually appreciated in value the $5 first. Dividends are merely a mechanism for transferring cash from the company to shareholders and dividends are not the only such mechanism.Jacob, you are correct there is nothing stopping a company growing for hundreds of years and reinvesting all its profits and/or buying its shares back. And yes, buybacks are equivalent to dividends in terms of transferring cash to shareholders (and arguably, much more tax efficient). But John s point is that even then, after hundreds of years, there is a limit to growth and a finite number of shares to buy back. Perhap in this future world, this fantasy company has swallowed up all other companies and all but one of its shareholders. Even then, that single remaining shareholder would demand some reward for sticking around. 1) If a company grows at the same rate (or less) as the economy/whatever, then the company has not  swallowed up all other companies  even after arbitrary time has passed.2) There are a finite and unbounded number of shares that can exist. Imagine that every time the share price reaches $100, there is a 2-for-1 split. Running out of shares for share buybacks is not an issue.Perhaps you should first imagine a simpler scenario where a company provides long-term value without ever paying a dividend AND NO GROWTH. Imagine a company that every year makes exactly $50K in profit and spends that $50K on share buybacks. Every time the share price reaches $100, there s a 2-for-1 split. This goes on for as long as you wish. There you go; a very modest company providing long term value for investors without a single dividend and no growth.You can add growth to the picture. Every year the economy grows as 2% and the company s profits grow at 1% (this goes on for quite some time until we saturate the observable universe with the most economically efficient arrangement of matter and energy). The company reinvests some of its profits and spends the rest on share buybacks. Shares are splits as needed. Over time the company is a smaller proportion of the overall economy despite growing every year.sory, correction to my first reply. I did say a  finite number of shares...  at first. That was wrong. I should have said  finite number of shareholders... Why would number of shareholders dwindle over time? That is not necessarily so.Even if there is only one remaining shareholder, that is no obstacle to share buybacks allowing the company to deliver cash flows to that single shareholder.Your objections are very puzzling to me.I think we both agree that everything else being equal, over any discrete time period, shareholders are indifferent if the company pays dividends, buys back stock, reinvests in more factories or stock piles cash. It s pure Modigliani-Miller. But....1) Who do you expect to eventually buy the company that is growing (or not) to become a trivial part of the economy with no promise of a payout? Not that the  great fool theory  isn t alive and well in NFT and Crypto space, but stops any interesting discussion of finance.2) I said shareholders, not shares. Eventually, the sold remaining shareholder needs to find a  rational  (see note 1) counterparty whether they own 1 share or a million. I do agree it helps to create real but simplified worlds (aka models) to help explain our much messier reality. In fact, I did so a few years ago in this article on buybacks: https://alphaarchitect.com/2018/08/30/buybacks-why-they-dont-matter-why-they-do-and-why-you-should-care-yet-still-relax/No promise of a payout? There are share buybacks. The company is willing to offer cash for your shares. No fool of any type is needed to turn your shares into cash flows.Jon Seed, I don t know you very well, but you seem to have a very strange quirk of treating share buybacks very differently than dividends. Why is it that you gave dividends a free pass to all your concerns but are so skeptical of share buybacks? Dividends and share buybacks are both mechanisms for a company to deliver cash to shareholders (aka give a  payout  as you are concerned about).I will agree, a firm can always buy everyone out and take the company private. A buyout is a  payout  my last remaining shareholder will rationally accept. Jon, I didn t say anything about buying everyone out (completely) and going private. I talked about normal share buybacks where  100% of outstanding shares are bought by the company, specifically about the situation of one shareholder that you seem concerned about. Share buybacks can go on for arbitrarily long amounts of time without completely buying everyone out and going private.I know. I just think we exhausted this conversation. For the record, though, I agree in the equivalence of buyback and dividends (I linked to my article earlier) and I m sure John is as well. I also agree then can go on for  arbitrarily long amounts of time . I disagree that buybacks can go on forever. I tried to use the natural end point (one last remaining shareholder) to illustrate why a firm has to eventually make a  payout , but obviously I failed. We can try one last time: why do you think that the situation of one shareholder and share buybacks can t go on forever? A sole shareholder can receive cash flows from the company via share buybacks forever (much like dividends).It seems your mom has a hunch about non ergodicity. Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

The utter failure of NASA s heavy-lift relative to Space-X seems like useful caution. They suggest  pull mechanisms,  like prizes. But the deeper question is, why do agencies not use pull mechanisms. The share of US GDP for farming is 0.9 percent and all agriculture is ~5 percent. Iowa with the highest share is ~10 percent and more GDP comes from Iowa s research labs than ag. I do an occasional survey with students, colleagues, friends and family and every single one says the share of CA ag gdp is ~ 50 percent and that of Indiana is 60 percent etc. (2.5   5 percents respectively). There is no red or blue bias here! All are way off! So during the next primaries, instead of pandering to farmers in Iowa (only 900K independent farmers left in the US and Archer Daniels Midlands type ag companies run 70 percent of farms now), maybe our pols should says how valuable an H1B visa is and how incredibly lucky the US is that it can corner the market of innovative and productive people into its geographic sphere. And just ask any student applying for MIT if they would take up a job or raise a family in Beijing. China or even the US can never replicate the US of the late 20-early 21st century. But the US can maintain the market for innovation and productivity by continuing to do what is does right now i.e. attract global talent.Sclerosis. Does not look good. Of course the source of the problem is in interest groups and the bureaucracy. Or us! The Reagan revolution has been all but forgotten. Even something as fundamental as the Thatcher revolution in Britain soon petered out.A peaceful revolution has the best chance of starting and winning here.  Total factor productivity  is not a meaningful metric. If F(K,L) is the production function for the economy, total factor productivity is F(K,L)/(K)/(L) = A(K,L). Total factor productivity growth is dA(K,L)/A(K,L)dt = d(ln(A(K,L))/dt = d(ln(F(K,L)-ln(K)-ln(L))/dt. Suppose F(K,L) = a K^b L^c, then dA(K,L)/A(K,L)dt = da(t)/a(t)dt + (b-1)dK(t)/K(t)dt + (c-1)dL(t)/L(t)dt = g(t), in the most general case. And, K = K1 + K2 + ... + Kn + ..., and, L = L1 + L2 + ... + Ln + ... if K and L are linear combinations of Ki and Li, i = 1, 2, ... , n, ... . But, if capital Ki and Li are not separable, in this sense, then F(K,L) = F1(K1,L1) + F2(K2,L2) + ... etc., and for a society that produces intermediate and primary products in addition to final products, and uses inputs from overseas (imports factor inputs) in addition to domestic inputs, the interrelationships between capital and labor become difficult to untangle. The automobile manufacturing industry is a case in point. It is said that inputs of intermediate products that make up the final product will cross the Canada-US border several times before becoming integrated in the final product in the US. Disentangling the inputs into such intermediate products is difficult, and the  total factor productivity  for such factor inputs is consequently difficult to define. The economist doesn t try to do so--she makes an estimate (a best guess, in most instances) and plugs a number into her spreadsheet model that then crunches the data and presto-magico out pops a number referred to as  TFP . The production environment has become considerably more complex than ever it was in the 1970s. In addition, much of the production is subcontracted overseas while the so-called  high value-added  work is performed domestically (without producing physical product, e.g.,  widgets ). Most of the semiconductor chips are designed in  fab-less  design centers while the chips themselves are produced overseas in  fabs  (Taiwan Semi, etc.) The drive is towards zero labor factor inputs onshore, and the transfer of capital intensive production to offshore centers where labor inputs are less expensive. GDP is an imperfect measure in those cases. GNP may capture more of total national output, but imperfectly as well.The control engineers would say, with some justification,  If you can t measure it, you can t control it.  But, if you re going to measure it, you may as well understand what it is you are measuring because it could be the wrong measure, a.s.Suppose one could accurately measure  TFP , precisely. Would that be a sufficient condition, or simply a necessary condition (perhaps one of many necessary conditions). Suppose this new  think tank  staff thought it was a sufficient condition, when it was only a necessary condition, and then went ahead and published its findings and drew up a list of recommended societal changes (actions) based on those (incorrect) findings. What damage or mischief might come of out of that? Enthusiasm is one thing (necessary, perhaps, but never sufficient), and  Web 3.0  is generating enthusiasm in some quarters, as an example, yet I can t help but think that there are too many  big-picture thinkers  these days, (too many chiefs) relative to worker bees.OEE, The control engineers would say, with some justification, If you can t measure it, you can t control it. But, if you re going to measure it, you may as well understand what it is you are measuring because it could be the wrong measure, a.s. Absolutely. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity The word total suggests all inputs have been measured. Official statisticians tend to use the term multifactor productivity (MFP) instead of TFP because some inputs such as energy are usually not included.  External costs including attributes of the workforce, public infrastructure such as highways and environmental sustainability costs such as mineral depletion and pollution are not traditionally included.  On the basis of dimensional analysis, TFP has been criticized as lacking meaningful units of measurement. The units of the quantities in the Cobb–Douglas equation are:A: (widgets * yearα + β – 1)/(caphrα * manhrβ), a balancing quantity, which is TFP In this construction the units of A would not have a simple economic interpretation, and the concept of TFP appear to be a modeling artifact. A  better  measure of productivity would simply be Real GDP / Total Credit Market Debt Outstanding. The units are widgets per nominal dollar of debt and both Real GDP and total debt outstanding are measurable quantities.Further, regarding your control engineer notation, a government (in particular a Treasury) CAN regulate the amount of debt that it issues irregardless of the wishes of the Legislature.See John s opening statements above: We need to be reminded occasionally that nothing matters but long-run growth, and long-run growth all comes from productivity, better knowledge of how to better serve human needs and desires. Not exactly.Productivity is a ratio (similar to efficiency in mechanical / electrical systems).With either TFP or Real GDP / TCMDO, maximizing productivity does not in and of itself maximize real growth, in the same way that maximizing the mechanical / electrical efficiency of a system does not necessarily maximize the total output of that system.Productivity is important because improvements in productivity are non-rivalrous - meaning I don t need to compete with my neighbor for scarce real resources to improve the amount of output that I am generating using what is already available to me.See Non-Rivalrous goods:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics) A good is considered non-rivalrous or non-rival if, for any level of production, the cost of providing it to a marginal (additional) individual is zero. Economist Paul Samuelson made the distinction between private and public goods in 1954 by introducing the concept of nonrival consumption. Economist Richard Musgrave followed on and added rivalry and excludability as criteria for defining consumption goods in 1959 and 1969. Country A has an endowment of 1000 tons of iron ore uses that ore to produce 1000 motorized vehicles (1 car per ton).Country B has an endowment of 5000 tons of iron ore and uses that ore to produce 3000 equivalent motorized vehicles (0.6 cars per ton).Even though country B has produced more cars (more real output), country A has a more productive society (more output for a given level of input).Wars are started when countries focus on maximizing output (using goods obtained in conquest) rather than maximizing productivity. Productivity  = output per unit of factor inputs. If Y equals the output of a Cobb-Douglas production function, F(K,L; A, a, b) = A.K^a.L^b, A 0, a  0, b  0, then, total factor productivity is given by F/(K^a.L^b) = A. Thus,  total factor productivity  equals the constant of proportionality, A. This is a tautology, i.e.,  a statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form  (Oxford Dictionary). Productivity growth  is then (dA(t)/dt)/A(t) and this can be written in terms of factor inputs K and L. Hence, dA(t)/A(t) = dY(t)/Y(t) - a.dK(t)/K(t) - b.dL(t)/L(t), using the chain-rule of differentiation. Productivity growth is non-dimensional. Suppose the labor supply is growing at the rate of dL(t)/L(t) = n(t). Further, suppose economic growth is given by g(t) = dY(t)/Y(t). Then, productivity growth is given by dA(t)/A(t) = g(t) - b.n(t) - a.dK(t)/K(t). Suppose dK(t) = -m.K(t).dt + Y(t).dt - C(t).dt, where C(t) is total consumption, all quantities expressed in units of the output commondity for consistency. Then, productivity growth is given by dA(t)/A(t) = g(t) -b.n(t) - a.m + Y(t)/K(t) - C(t)/K(t). Let, y(t) = Y(t)/L(t), c(t) = Y(t)/L(t), and k(t) = K(t)/L(t). Total factor productivity growth can be expressed as follows, dA(t)/A(t) = g(t) -b.n(t) -a.m +[y(t) - c(t)].k(t) (1)In words, {TFP growth} = {economic growth rate, g} minus [{share of labor, b} x {labor growth rate, n}] minus [{share of capital, a} x {capital depreciation rate, m}] + [{net capital investment per unit of labor, y - c} x {capital:labor ration, k}].Any estimation of TFP growth must include the specification of the production function assumed in constructing the regression model.Note, in the Cobb-Douglas production function specification, that TFP has units of the output commodity divided by the product of {units of capital}^a and {units of labor}^b, in order to be consistent with the assumed form of the production function. The Wikipedia author s criticism is nonsensical.This simple model (incorrectly stated in my original comment posted above) belies the actual complexity of a modern open economy (exports and imports omitted), as noted in that comment.Because the definition of total factor productivity is a tautology, it is not uniquely defined, but depends on the mathematical model of the assumed production function. Labor productivity, per se, is only valid for a specific level of capital employed. It is a universal metric but its usefulness is limited. Likewise with capital productivity.The marginal product of capital is (r + m) on the optimal growth trajectory; likewise, the marginal product of labor is w on the optimal growth trajectory. Off the optimal growth trajectory, marginal products are lower (by definition)Determining which of Society A and Society B is  more productive  is more complicated than illustrated in your example. Consider: A BMW Isetta uses less steel per vehicle than does a Suburban, but the Suburban can carry more cargo and passengers per trip-mile than an Isetta can. Which is the  more productive  depends on the nature of the product (passenger trip-miles per unit time per vehicle, for example). It may be  more productive  for Society A and Society B to export their iron ore resources to Society C which has scale economies in the production of  cars , and import such mixes of  cars  as best suits their individual social welfare utility functions. Simple statistics are rarely, if ever, conclusive in determining the winner of  more productive  comparisons. Determining which of Society A and Society B is more productive is more complicated than illustrated in your example. Consider: A BMW Isetta uses less steel per vehicle than does a Suburban, but the Suburban can carry more cargo and passengers per trip-mile than an Isetta can. I presume that in calculations of Real GDP (widgets), the Suburban counts as more widgets than does an Isetta via hedonic adjustment?See my orginal postulation -  Country B has an endowment of 5000 tons of iron ore and uses that ore to produce 3000 EQUIVALENT motorized vehicles (0.6 cars per ton). My example was written to illustrate the point out that maximizing real economic growth (Real GDP) and maximizing productivity (ratio of Real GDP and inputs) are not the same thing.If Russia does invade the Ukraine and re-absorb it, Russian national Real GDP will likely rise (more workers, more resources, more output). Net Russian productivity may not rise with it.If your example  was written to illustrate the point out that maximizing real economic growth (Real GDP) and maximizing productivity (ratio of Real GDP and inputs) are not the same thing , it didn t achieve that end. To wit,Economic growth is dY(t)/Y(t)/dt. Productivity is Y(t)/[K(t)^a L(t)^b]= A(t). The former is the time rate of change of economic activity per unit of economic activity. The latter is the ratio of economic activity to the factor inputs utilized to generate that activity (e.g., your example) at a specific instant in time. The time rate of change of productivity, (i.e., productivity growth) dA(t)/A(t)/dt, is the quantity that is of interest to economists. Suppose that in period t = 0, productivity is A(0) and output is Y(0) = F(K(0),L(0)) = A(0).[K(0)^a.L(0)^b], where, a + b = 1 (i.e., constant economies of scale). Now, suppose that you have a brilliant idea on a means to improve productivity in period t = 1, and suppose you are correct and your idea is put to practice resulting in improved productivity, i.e., A(1)   A(0). Suppose that capital, K, and labor, L, in period t =1 is unchanged from period t =0, i.e., K(1) = K(0), and L(1) = L(0). What happens to output in period t = 1? Output should increase, i.e., Y(1)   Y(0) in the ratio A(1)/A(0), ceteris paribus. In this example, productivity growth, ln(A(1)) - ln(A(0)), to a first approximation, leads to output growth, ln(Y(1)) - ln(Y(0)), in equal measure, ceteris paribus.Suppose that your goal is not to increase output, but to reduce factor inputs. How would you achieve that purpose? Ans. -- reduce K, and L is proportion to the increase in A. Note that the sum of the exponents is equal to 1, in the assumption at the beginning of this comment. One such evolution, that achieves your goal, is given by Y(1) = Y(0), A(1)   A(0), K(1)   K(0), and L(1)   L(0) such that K(1)/K(0) = [A(0)/A(1)]^(1/a) and L(1)/L(0) = [A(0)/A(1)]^(1/b). You might pursue that goal if your output with the productivity improvement exceeds the demand for your output in the goods or services marketplace in period t = 1, for example. Typically, though, the economists prefer to view productivity growth as a driver for societal welfare improvement, especially when net popuation growth is positive, whether by natural increase or a combination of natural increase and increase in net immigration.We need to be reminded that what matters most is equanimity, understanding at the experiential level the transient nature of existence – particles arising and passing away with great rapidity, nothing to cling to, no “I, me, mine,” giving us the ability to face every moment with a peaceful mind.My other comment not withstanding, I generally agree with your article. About 30 years ago I surveyed a wide range of econometric studies on the optimal level of government for GDP growth: almost all studies found 22% optimal, none was far from that. My experience as a government economic policy adviser in the UK and Australia suggests that governments are increasingly intrusive, and public servants increasingly obstructive. The best governments here - under Hawke (ALP) and Howard (Liberal)- had ministers with wide experience of life, an openness to ideas and a genuine interest in public welfare. Now we have mainly careerists. The situation in many/most Australian universities is also dire, with woke left-wing ideas dominant.Michael, The best governments here - under Hawke (ALP) and Howard (Liberal)- had ministers with wide experience of life, an openness to ideas and a genuine interest in public welfare. Is our education system designed to provide that  wide experience of life  or has it become a toxic mix of specialization and career advancement through affiliation (political party, race, sexual orientation, or other)?Current Wealth comes being FIRST in line for the WAVE of CASH being printed! Democrats are currently showering THEIR STATES with Trillions.It is sad seeing the veritable financial Rape of the next generation. Every Child Born Today has $100,000 of Federal DEBT. We are Rapidly copying the centrally planned and centrally controlled economy of the USSR.Want to get rich be the son or daughter of Biden and Pelosi et al...where they MAKE millions for the simple action of being the child of an Important Democrat who can arrange meetings.Wall Street barely functions to create real jobs...just gamble on High Speed Financial Speculation of Speculation with a FED that offers Unlimited Backing of Speculation for the  right groups ! Or do a renewable tax credit FLIP deal...so a Fortune 500 company can pay ZERO income Tax on multi-billion dollar profits!John, Political Economy. How can we reform the US regulatory and administrative state to remove all those veto points, roadblocks, and stifling red tape? To reduce the veto points you simply shift to an autocracy (king / queen) instead of the representative Democracy that we live under today.That way when the king / queen decides to try, convict, and imprison you for no good reason, there won t be anyone to veto his / her decision.John, So it perhaps shouldn’t be a surprise that the federal government that went to the moon in 1969 botched production of simple diagnostic tests during a once-in-a-century pandemic. The same government went to war in Vietnam in 1965.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incidenthttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=LbN7If you want to improve GDP you will have to improve labor productivity -- we have been in a downward trendline for almost twenty years. We have the most educated laborforce in history, and the availability of labor worldwide; we are not utilizing a resource that is right before us.We are more of a service sector economy now so maybe we need to reorganize our business structures -- maybe try going back to hierarchical organizations with an international/national reach -- and also expand the tech capabilities in the service sectors.https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=LbN7This measure of productivity is a farce.If government pays people not to work then hours worked fall and productivity  improves  through fewer hours worked. Inflation rises because income increases while real output stagnates.I mean hell, if increasing output PER hour is the secret sauce to improving national productivity, then just pay people to sit at home doing nothing and import everything.Hours worked falls to zero and productivity shoots off to infinity.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

		<text>John Cochrane s blogA Project Syndicate Essay. Before it moves on to climate change, inequality, and racial issues, the Fed should have to think just a little bit about the evident failure of its existing financial regulation. Why Isn t the Fed Doing its Job?The nomination of new members to the US Federal Reserve Board offers an opportunity for Americans – and Congress – to reflect on the world’s most important central bank and where it is going. The obvious question to ask first is how the Fed blew its main mandate, which is to ensure price stability.

We need more capital, not many more thousands of pages of rules. Capital provides a buffer against all shocks, and it does not require regulators to be clairvoyant. The Fed has scandalously blocked narrow-banking enterprises and payments providers that could help serve many Americans’ financial needs. Before turning to healing the planet and righting injustice, the Fed should be held to account for how badly it is doing on the basic task of protecting the financial system. Why is price stability the Fed s main mandate? Certainly it s an important but so is managing unemployment. If the Fed wants to get into social engineering, I propose the Fed outlaw banking in those states that do not outlaw property zoning.The cost of housing in America is ruinous, and it stems in large part from property zoning and scarce supply.I beg to differ. Housing costs have skyrocketed because of the cost of building a house (replacement costs)When the cost of a permit to replace a wall heater is greater than the cost of the heater, this rather basic event indicates how building regulations and codes are out of control and consequently raise the price of building a new house.There s plenty of land so zoning is not an issue. The cost of developing the land due to government regulations is the problemSure, many regs make a mess, but in some cities, such as L.A., 70% of land is zoned single-family detached. What the West Coast needs is forests of 60-story condo towers, right where people want to live. You can build 60-story condo tower outside Palmdale. There is plenty of land. Mr. Cole, you vastly overestimate the attractiveness of living in one of a  forest  of 60-story condo towers. Not everyone is single without children and looking for a cave to hide in.It s not just the zoning - in many cities with highest home price appreciation water and sewer capacity is very limited. This capacity is very expensive and cannot be added in small increments - and many of those cities are in such dire financial straits it would be very challenging economically and politically to sell bonds to pay for services for new development.The Fed is not, should not, and cannot be responsible for local zoning laws or failure to upgrade local infrastructure. California has ample tax income to fund any and all necessary infrastructure; it simply chooses not to fund it. As for Fed policy, debt reduces flexibility. Massive debt eliminates flexibility. As John states, humans and human institutions, including the Fed, are not clairvoyant. So building fragile structures is a failed strategy. Will we ever learn? No, probably not. In the USA, political expediency reigns supreme. Weimar, here we come.  ... the Fed should be held to account for how badly it is doing on the basic task of protecting the financial system.  While I am sympathetic to the general thrust of this essay, I have to conclude with the observation that the Scotch verdict  Not proved  applies in this case.The Federal Reserve itself says there are 4 major areas of responsibility, none of which is to influence climate change or social policies. The first is:  Conducting the nation s monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of full employment and stable prices. I am archiving their current FAQ for posterity because in the future, their stated mission likely will include climate change and social policies. Great column. One question: the left wants more regulation, but the answer is more capital. Touche. What does the right want?sadly the richest don t get tired of wealth accumulation unlike times past where people like Carnegie, Rockefeller, etc actually built business...then set about helping others. Henry Ford paid his employees to make sure they could afford his car.Today s wall street...the recipient of MORE THAN $9 trillion of FED Lagress...is unlimitedly glutenous with a raw hatred of most of America and actually little interest in business and its success! Government today isn t to help people and businesses...it is to enrich select cronies and itself using unlimited power and DEBT! Sadly I believe the next downturn with be a once in 100 year Event!--  Henry Ford paid his employees to make sure they could afford his car. Sorry to say, but that s an apocryphal story. Ford had 100% daily labor turnover at the pay rate originally offered. He had to raise pay for the extremely boring assembly line work. Ford paid his employees to stop quitting. The end result was they could afford to buy his car.The last three downturns were 100 year events (as measured relying on Gaussian statistics)--no reason the next downturn won t be. Cheers.The difficulty for the Fed going forward in an environment of higher inflation, higher interest rates, and probably higher growth rates, is the balancing act it will have to do between tapping the breaks on our domestic economy if inflation rates climb versus the financial funding accommodation the international markets will need to keep functioning. Don’t forget that before the pandemic hit, in the Autumn of 2019, our Fed had to intervene when the financial intermediaries (banks) could not meet the run for cash/cash equivalents. With actors pulling at both ends of the monetary policy rope for tightening and loosening, the Fed will have a delicate tap dance satisfying its impetuous players.Currently inflation is the illness. Interest rates the castor oil. Any delay taking the medicine prolongs the illness. Worry about other things when circumstances improve.The Fed getting into areas where they have no business scares the bejeebers out of me. Perhaps they are moving into these areas because they can t cover their main task (price stability) and want to feel good about themselves? Pitiful.Plain manila Taylor rules put current interest rate targets over 8 percent. Not surprised we have inflation when interest rates are purposefully held so much lower than required.Pete BiasAnonymous / Pete Bias,8% interest rates x $28.43 trillion in federal debt = $2.27 trillion in interest payments on that debt.

Again, thanks Mr. President, we can now have a straightforward discussion. Thanks for your excellent summary. These people are not our best and brightest.Thanks for your excellent summary. These people are not our best and brightest.I give John credit for tight walking through a nasty minefield. Because any disagreement, even in the mildest form, could be misconstrued. Perhaps that s the point.I will be less artful. One can and should question the motivations behind these specific choices without it impugning women, women of color, or their qualifications in the field of economics. I ll go ahead and say it more cleanly. This smells of virtue signaling in the worst way.As a former FRBNY officer, some thoughts:1. Classically, the horizon for climate change would normally allow the repricing of contracts to reflect the risk (absent some very tail probability like the collapse of the ice shelf and the reversal of the Gulf Stream.2. Climate change is a classic externality, one that is global in scope. The collective governments have agreed to address by committing to carbon reduction goals.3. In the best of all worlds, this would be done transparently through legislation.4. We all know that we do not live in such a world.5. By nominating Raskin, I don t think you can say it is  beyond what the Administration is willing to do. 6. I would prefer to directly raise the cost of carbon (either through exchanges or taxes), but this may be a  next best  solution.7. Do not let the best be the enemy of the good.8. Prepare for the 2nd order consequences of this action.I think the natural retort would be:This feels like a overreach of the feds stated powers. The whole reason the Fed avoids checks and balances of traditional government is because it has a limited and transparent scope of power. The FED is also supposed to be apolitical, but it sure doesn t feel that way.Politics and economics go together like peanut butter and jelly, but often don t have the same taste every time. There s no escaping or separating these two critical functions of society. To me this isn t about the Fed picking winners or losers per se. It s inevitable there s toe smashing in the attempt to have the illusion of stability, with as little variation as possible. Utopia, yes?This comment has been removed by the author.Your critique of Dr. Cook needs some work. First you say her record is too thin - and then you say she s doing too much and that you re bewildered by how much she s doing. So, which is it? You cherry picked her research to avoid mentioning all she s done that is clearly in line with the Fed s mandate. Do you think Milton Friedman made a mistake by backing her research? Or, did that fact not fit with your fairy tale. I can t find anything she s written about mandating DEI and ESG at banks. Your implication that her work  might mean  she supports those things is utterly silly. As for this notion you led with that some journalists called you and asked for your views on Dr. Cook - well, why not name them? What an odd and truly weird hack job. May your feet never touch the ground, John. John obviously struck a nerve... I have a lot of complaints about the Fed; usually its been too tight.The Fed has a thousand economists, but there is never a clear discussion of whether a larger balance sheet is inflationary, or actually anti-inflationary in that it increases investor confidence in the federal government ability to meet debts.I might even wonder if it is better to create money through money-financed fiscal programs, rather than through greater government borrowing or more commercial bank lending.And yet even I think these three choices for the Federal Reserve board are absolutely crummy, for the reasons suggested in this excellent blog.Hell, it s the commanding heights! Been there, done that.May the Lord have mercy on our souls.What is Spacial Racism ? Is it discrimination against Martians ? The Fed doesn t do well what it should be doing. Can we hope that it will do at least as well what it shouldn t be doing? Hi Dr. Cochrane - I hope all is well. I had your Investments course at the GSB in  97 (or  98?). It was a great class. I wanted to ask about the comment, above,  The idea of climate risk to the financial system is, in my view...farcical . I know it s certainly the case that climate change can affect companies and industries so I wanted to ask, what are the criteria for something to have a material, adverse risk to the stability of the whole system. Is it the potential for some x% change in liquidity or prices across the U.S. market (that quickly  infects  world markets), or the world market in general, that persists for a certain time? How quickly does it have to happen? As an example, would it have to be something like the crisis in 2008 but that was precipitated by a climate disaster? It would be helpful to get a sense for what the magnitudes would have to be for people to agree it was due to  climate change  (whether that s a mega-disaster or series of disasters or some quantifiable trend).Thanks, Matt Click on the energy or environment links. I went on and on over the last few months on the topic of climate financial risks. On its own, this is too brusque a sentence, you are right, but there is a lot behind it. Thanks - I ll check it out. (This was my first foray to the Grumpy Economist blog!) The idea of climate risk to the financial system is, in my view (and my reading of the scientific literature) so farcical that I called this out as a subterfuge.  You are a theoretical economist, I wouldn t expect you to understand the scientific literature of climate change well enough to derive its risk to financial system (which also requires empirical grounding, something you seem to lack). I do have one addition here. The FT, as no doubt others, notes the critical lack of banks in minority communities. The Chicago Fed has fsimilar finding in its study of Detroit. Without banking services and loans, local business in minority communities find it difficult to scale their businesses and build wealth. At the time I read this the Chicago Fed asked for local community representatives to serve on an advisory board. I immediately thought of the North Lawndale community which is in partnership with Old St Pat s RC church. Speaking with Rodney Brown, a top official in North Lawndale s comprehensive community organization, they even have a Chamber of Commerce and a banking committee, I learn that North Lawndale just got its first bank in 20 years! Wintrust located in the neighborhood this past April. For these reasons, as well as others, Lisa Cook brings an important perspective to the Fed - that of ample financial services in minority communities to support local businesses, hence growth and wealth building. ...thinktank essays listed under publications  lol.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

Cochrane /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span From its inflection point in February 2021 to November 2021, the CPI rose 6 percent (278.88/263.161), an 8 percent annualized rate.  nbsp;Why? nbsp; /p  p Starting in March 2020, in response to the disruptions of Covid-19, the U.S. government created about $3 trillion of new bank reserves, equivalent to cash, and sent checks to people and businesses. (Mechanically, the Treasury issued $3 trillion of new debt, which the Fed quickly bought in return for $3 trillion of new reserves. The Treasury sent out checks, transferring the reserves to people’s banks. See Table 1.)  nbsp;The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so, and sent more checks. Overall federal debt rose nearly 30 percent. Is it at all a surprise that a year later inflation breaks out?  nbsp;It is hard to ask for a clearer demonstration of fiscal inflation, an immense fiscal helicopter drop, exhibit A for the fiscal theory of the price level (Cochrane 2022a, 2022b).  nbsp; /p  div class= separator  style= clear: both; text-align: center;   a href= https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgdmCeNx46KottVgXGPrYA9B5SnObNXp8knXHaZTW6wDW7Lo0h9yuwRTFvFJ3KspEKRNRIWoXI777jnUICWU10h47lWefPtfn9Oh-Mta-Esxuoh_Bl-YndGLbPZZC17Kz4Uu_0XIdlnEIvAJ3LFRiG9s8cinkibXvqWPrL2wK9LFFnvWMPDtc8tflg=s1744  style= margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;   img border= 0  height= 285  src= https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgdmCeNx46KottVgXGPrYA9B5SnObNXp8knXHaZTW6wDW7Lo0h9yuwRTFvFJ3KspEKRNRIWoXI777jnUICWU10h47lWefPtfn9Oh-Mta-Esxuoh_Bl-YndGLbPZZC17Kz4Uu_0XIdlnEIvAJ3LFRiG9s8cinkibXvqWPrL2wK9LFFnvWMPDtc8tflg=w640-h285  width= 640  /  /a  /div  p  b What Dropped from the Helicopter? nbsp; /b  /p  p From December 2019 to September 2021, the M2 money stock also increased by $5.6 trillion.  nbsp;This looks like a monetary, not a fiscal intervention, Milton Friedman’s (1969) classic tale that if you want inflation, drop money from helicopters. But is it monetary or fiscal policy? Ask yourself: Suppose the expansion of M2 had been entirely financed by purchasing Treasury securities. Imagine Treasury debt had declined $5 trillion while M2 and reserves rose $5 trillion. Imagine that there had been no deficit at all, or even a surplus during this period. The monetary theory of inflation, MV=PY, states that we would see the same inflation. Really?  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Similarly, ask yourself: Suppose that the Federal Reserve had refused to go along. Suppose that the Treasury had sent people Treasury bills directly, accounts at Treasury.gov, along with directions how to sell them if people wished to do so. Better, suppose that the Treasury had created new mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and sent people mutual fund shares. (I write mutual fund as money market funds are counted in M2.) The monetary theory of inflation says again that this would have had no effect. These would be a debt issue, causing no inflation, not a monetary expansion. Really? nbsp; span  /span  /p  a name= more   /a  p  /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Clearly, overall debt matters, not the split of government debt between interest-paying reserves or monetary base and Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve itself is nothing more than an immense money-market fund, offering shares that are pegged at $1 each, pay interest, and are backed by a portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. (Plus, an army of regulators and a huge staff of economists who are supposed to help forecast inflation.) nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Milton Friedman’s (1969) helicopter drop is a powerful parable. But a helicopter drop is a fiscal policy, not a monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve may not legally drop money from helicopters; it may not write checks to voters. The Fed may even less vacuum up money; it may not tax people. Helicopter drops and money vacuums are fiscal operations. The Fed may only lend money, or buy and sell assets. To accomplish a helicopter drop in the United States, the Treasury must issue debt, the Fed must buy it with newly printed money, and then the Treasury must drop that money from helicopters, writing it down as a transfer payment. And that is pretty much exactly what happened. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Ask yourself: If, as Friedman’s helicopter is dropping $1,000 on each household, the Fed sends burglars who remove $1,000 of Treasury securities from the same households, would we still see inflation? That’s monetary policy. If Friedman’s helicopter were followed by the Treasury secretary with a bullhorn, shouting “Enjoy your $1,000 in helicopter money. Taxes are going up $1,000 tomorrow,” would we still see inflation? nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Friedman’s helicopters are not a monetary change, a substitution of money for debt, an increase in the liquidity of a given set of household assets. They are a “wealth effect” of government debt. Dropping debt from helicopters is a brilliant psychological device for convincing people that the government debt raining down on them will not be repaid by future taxes or spending restraint. It will be left outstanding, so they had better spend it now. nbsp; /p  p Indeed, we just witnessed a “helicopter drop.” But a helicopter drop is fiscal policy. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Why did fiscal inflation not happen sooner? The government has been borrowing money like the proverbial drunken sailor, for decades. The Fed has been buying Treasury securities and turning the debt into reserves for a decade. Why now? /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Inflation comes when government debt increases, relative to people’s expectations of what the government will repay. If the Treasury borrows, but everyone understands it will later raise tax revenues or cut spending to repay the debt, that debt does not cause inflation. It is a good investment, and people are happy to hold on to it. If the Fed prints up a lot of money, buys Treasury debt, and the Treasury hands out the money, as happened, but everyone understands the Treasury will pay back the debt with future surpluses, the extra money causes no inflation. The Fed can always soak up the money by selling its Treasury securities, and the Treasury repays those securities with surpluses (i.e., taxes less spending). nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span The 2020–2021 borrowing and money episode was distinctive because, evidently, it came without a corresponding increase in expectations that the government would, someday, raise surpluses by $5 trillion in present value to repay the debt.  nbsp;Looking in to people’s heads is hard, but why? We can at least find some plausible speculations. nbsp; /p  p One may look to politicians’ statements. Even in the Obama-era “stimulus” spending, the administration emphasized promises of eventual debt reduction. One may chuckle and sneer at promises to repay debts decades after an administration leaves office, but at least they went through the motions to make that promise! Nobody went through any motions about long-run fiscal planning, long-run deficit reduction, and entitlement and tax reform, in 2020–2021.  nbsp;It was the era of modern monetary theory (MMT), of costless “fiscal expansion” made possible, or so it was claimed, by the manna-from-heaven that interest rates would stay low forever. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span The manner of fiscal expansion matters too. When the Treasury borrows in the usual manner, it borrows from established long-term investors, who view Treasury debt as debt that will be repaid and not defaulted or inflated. They view it as a savings or investment vehicle, not as cash to be spent. They save, or invest, based on long and so-far mostly successful experience. This time, following canary-in-the-coal mine disruptions in Treasury markets during March 2020, the Federal Reserve immediately bought new Treasury debt with newly created money, before it even touched these investor’s portfolios. The effect of the operation was to print new money and send people checks, so the debt issue is now held as bank deposits flowing into reserves, rather than as Treasury securities. People holding this new money are likely to spend it rather than regard it as a long-term investment.  nbsp;In our simplest economic models, it does not matter who holds the debt. But in just a little more nuanced view, who holds the debt matters. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span In our simplest economic models, interest-paying reserves and Treasuries are equivalent securities. But people likely do see a difference between reserves and short-run Treasuries. Treasuries may well carry a reputation that they will be repaid, while people assume reserves will not be repaid by larger surpluses. Then issuing lots of reserves rather than Treasuries is inflationary, but not because the reserves are ``money,’’ but rather because they convey a different set of fiscal expectations, just as dropping money or debt from helicopters sends a different signal about repayment than issuing debt at a Treasury auction. /p  p Most of the previous operations financed government spending or government worker salaries, counting on higher incomes to slowly filter through the economy. This one sent checks directly to people.  nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Finally, this fiscal stimulus was enormous, and carried out on a deep misdiagnosis of the state of the economy. Even in simplistic hydraulic Keynesian terms, $5 trillion times any multiplier is much larger than any plausible GDP gap. And the Covid recession was not due to a demand deficiency in the first place. A pandemic is, to the economy, like a huge snowstorm. Sending people money will not get them to go out to closed bars, restaurants, airlines, and businesses. nbsp; /p  p “Stimulus,” “accommodation,” “easing” was the point. This method finally worked, where previous stimulus efforts failed. One can see several suggestive differences, which amount to important economic lessons. /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span What about “supply shocks?” What about a shift of demand from services to durables? Much analysis misses the difference between relative prices and inflation, in which all prices and wages rise together. A supply shock makes one good more expensive than others. Only demand makes all goods rise together. There wouldn’t be “supply chain” problems if people were not trying to buy things like mad! A shift in demand from services to durables can make durable prices go up. But it would make services prices go down. And let us not even go down the ridiculous path of blaming inflation on a sudden contagious outbreak of “greed” and “collusion” by businesses from oil companies to turkey farmers, needing the administration to send the FTC out to investigate. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span It is telling that inflation was a complete surprise to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve’s job is supposed to be to monitor the supply capacity of the economy and to make sure demand does not outstrip it.  nbsp;The Fed failed twice. First, the economy did not need demand-side stimulus. Insurance was wise, and forestalling a financial crisis was necessary. But sending money to every citizen to stoke demand was not. Second, the Fed being surprised by supply shocks is as excusable as the Army losing a battle because its leaders are surprised that the enemy might attack.  nbsp;As we see by the outcome, the Fed’s understanding of supply, largely based on statistical analysis of labor markets, is rudimentary. nbsp; /p  p  b  nbsp; WilI Inflation Continue? nbsp; /b  /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span If the government borrows or prints $5 trillion, with no change in its plan to repay debt, on top of $17 trillion outstanding debt, then the price level will rise a cumulative 30 percent, so that the $22 trillion of debt is worth in real terms what the $17 trillion was before. In essence, absent a credible increase in future surpluses, the deficit is financed by defaulting on $5 trillion of outstanding debt, via inflation. By this calculation, the 6 percent or so cumulative inflation we have seen so far leaves a way to go.  nbsp;But people may think some of the debt will be repaid. If they think half will eventually be repaid, then the price level need only rise 15 percent overall. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span But then it stops. A one-time unbacked debt increase leads to a one-time price-level increase, not continuing inflation. Whether inflation continues or not depends on future  nbsp;monetary policy, future fiscal policy, and whether people change their minds about overall debt repayment.  nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Fiscal policy may not be done with us yet. If unbacked fiscal expansions continue—that is, borrowing when people do not expect additional repayment—then additional bouts of fiscal inflation will occur. Untold trillions of spending, including new entitlements, with no realistic hope of raising tax revenues commensurately to cover them are certainly high on the Biden administration’s agenda. (Higher tax rates do not necessarily mean higher revenues, if economic growth falters; and even so the proposed taxes do not cover the proposed spending increases even with static scoring.) The mentality that borrowed money need never be repaid, because the MMT fairy or r lt;g magic makes debt free, remains strong in Washington.  nbsp;But the failure of the so-called “Build Back Better” plan may augur well for budget seriousness and a limit to ill-constructed social policies with strong supply disincentives. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span The most troublesome question remains: Do people, having decided that at least some of our government’s new debt will not be repaid, so they should spend it now and inflate it away, now think that the government is less likely to repay its existing debts, or less likely to repay future borrowing? If so, even more inflation can break out, seemingly (as always) out of nowhere. nbsp; /p  p  b Fiscal Constraints on Monetary Policy nbsp; /b  /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Fiscal and monetary policies are always intertwined in causing or curing inflation. Even in a pure fiscal theory of the price level, monetary policy (setting interest rates) can control the path of expected future inflation. Thus, whether inflation continues or not also depends on how monetary policy reacts to this fiscal shock and its consequences. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Whether the Fed will do something about it is an obvious concern. The Fed’s habits and new operating procedures, formed before 2019 in a Maginot Line against perpetual below-target inflation, look remarkably like the Fed of about 1971: Let inflation blow hot to march down the Phillips curve to greater employment, wait for inflation to exceed target for a while before doing anything about it, talk about “transitory” and “supply” shocks to excuse each error. The Fed understands “expectations” now, unlike in 1971, but seems to view them as a third force amenable to management by “forward guidance” speeches rather than formed by a hardy and skeptical experience with the Fed’s concrete actions. The Fed likes to say it has “the tools” to contain inflation, but never dares to say just what those tools are.  nbsp;In recent U.S. historical experience, the Fed’s tool is to replay 1980: 20 percent interest rates, a bruising recession hurting the disadvantaged especially, and the medicine applied for as long as it takes. Will our Fed really do that? Will our Congress let our Fed do that? Can you deter an enemy without revealing what’s in your arsenal and whether you will use it? /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span If the Fed needs to fight inflation, fiscal constraints on monetary policy will play a large and unexpected role. In 1980, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 25 percent. Today it is 100 percent, and rising swiftly. Fiscal constraints on monetary policy are four times larger today, and counting. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span  For a rise in interest rates to lower inflation, fiscal policy must tighten as well. Without that fiscal cooperation, monetary policy cannot lower inflation. There are two important channels of this interconnection. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span First, the rise in interest rates raises interest costs on the debt. The government must  nbsp;pay those higher interest costs, by raising tax revenues and cutting spending, or by credibly promising to do so in the future. At 100 percent debt to GDP, 5 percentage points higher interest rates mean an additional deficit of 5 percent of GDP or $1 trillion, for every year that high interest rates continue. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span This consideration is especially relevant if the underlying cause of the inflation is fiscal policy. If we are having inflation because people don’t believe that the government can pay off the deficits it is running to send people checks, and it will not reform the looming larger entitlement promises, then people will not believe that the government can pay off an additional $1 trillion deficit to pay interest costs on the debt.  nbsp;In a fiscally driven inflation, it can happen that the central bank raises rates to fight inflation, which raises the deficit via interest costs, and thereby only makes inflation worse. This has, for example, been an analysis of several episodes in Brazil. /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Second, if monetary policy lowers inflation, then bondholders earn a real windfall. Fiscal policy must tighten to pay this windfall.  nbsp;People who bought 10-year Treasury bonds in September of 1981 got a 15.84 percent yield, as markets expected inflation to continue. From September 1981 to September 1991, the CPI grew at a 3.9 percent average rate. By this back of the envelope calculation, those bondholders got an amazing 12 percent annual real return. That return came completely and entirely courtesy of U.S. taxpayers.  nbsp;The 1986 tax reform and deregulation, which allowed the United States to grow strongly for 20 years, eventually did produce fiscal surpluses that nearly repaid U.S. federal debt. At 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio, each 5 percentage point reduction in the price level requires another 5 percent of GDP fiscal surplus. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Ask yourself, if inflation gets built into bond yields, and the Fed tries to lower inflation, will our Congress really raise tax revenues or cut spending in order to finance an unexpected (by definition) and undeserved (it will surely be argued) windfall profit to wealthy investors, foreign central bankers, and fat-cats on Wall Street?  nbsp;If it does not do so, the monetary attempt at disinflation fails. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span We state too casually that that the United States will always repay its debts, and prioritize that repayment over all else. We should not take such probity for granted. For example, in the 2021 debt ceiling discussion, it stated as fact by all concerned, from the Treasury to Congress to the White House, that hitting the debt ceiling must trigger a formal default. That is untrue. The United States could easily prioritize its tax revenues to repaying interest and principal on outstanding debt, by cutting other spending instead. Painful, yes. Impossible, no. That the U.S. contingency plan for a binding debt ceiling is formal default tells you that the spirit of Alexander Hamilton, preaching the sanctity of debt repayment to build reputation so we can borrow in the future, is truly dead. And with inflation, we are not even talking about formal default. The question is, will the United States undertake a sharp fiscal austerity to support monetary policy in the fight against inflation, by paying higher interest costs on the debt and by repaying bondholders in more valuable money?  nbsp;Or will the government just repay as promised, but in dollars that are worth more than expected? If the government does the latter, monetary policy fails. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span There is a third troublesome requirement for higher nominal interest rates to produce lower inflation. One needs an economic model in which this is true, that model needs to be correct, and its preconditions need to be met.  nbsp;It’s not as easy as it sounds, because in the long run, when real interest rates settle down, higher nominal interest rates must come with higher, not lower inflation. So you need an understanding of how and when things work the other direction in the short run. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span In standard new-Keynesian models, used by all central banks, for example, higher interest rates only produce lower inflation if the higher interest rate is unexpected—that is, a “shock” to the economy—and if there is a sharp contemporaneous fiscal contraction, for the above reasons.  nbsp; A widely expected rise in nominal interest rates raises inflation.  nbsp;A rise in interest rates without the corresponding ``austerity’’ raises inflation.  nbsp;Both preconditions are questionable today. span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span More complex ingredients, such as long-term debt or financial frictions, can allow a higher nominal rate to temporarily lower inflation. But reliance on more complex ingredients and frictions is also dangerous. nbsp; /p  p  b The Future /b  /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span The future is not hopeless. Inflation control simply requires our government, including the central bank, to understand classic lessons of history. Forestalling inflation is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Stabilizing inflation once it gets out of control is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Expectations are “anchored” if people believe such policy is in place, and politicians and Fed officials are ready to act if needed. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span I add “micro-economic,” as it is perhaps the most frequently overlooked adjective. Fiscal surpluses do not result from sharply higher tax rates, especially of a tax system so riven with economic distortions as ours. Fiscal surpluses can come from spending restraint, but that too is difficult. The best road to fiscal surpluses is strong economic growth, which increases the tax base and lowers the need for social spending.  nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span In the conundrum between taxes and spending, there is a way out: raise long-term economic growth. And there is only one way to do that: to increase the supply-side capacity of the economy. That is, however, just as politically controversial as the first two options. Most of the job is to get out of the way. Most economic regulation is designed to transfer incomes, to protect various interests, or to push on the scales of bilateral negotiation, to undo the harsh siren of economic incentives, in a way that stifles economic growth. Many interests hate pro-growth legislation and regulation just as much as they hate taxes and spending cuts. The r lt;g crowd has a point, but increasing g is the answer. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span Much of the “supply shocks” of 2021 come down to the “great resignation”—that is,  nbsp;the puzzling decline in labor force participation despite a labor shortage. The work disincentives of social programs—paying people not to work, bluntly—are laid bare. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span All successful inflation stabilizations have combined monetary, fiscal, and micro-economic reforms. I emphasize reforms. In most cases the tax system is reformed to provide more revenue with less distortion. The structure of spending programs is reformed to help people in need more efficiently without work disincentives. Regulations are reformed, though they hurt the profits of incumbents, to increase entry, competition and innovation.  nbsp;The policy regime is changed, durably. Reversible decisions and pie-crust promises do not do much to change the present value of surpluses, to raise the government’s ability to pledge a long stream of surpluses to support debt. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span 1980 did not succeed in the United States from monetary toughness only.  nbsp;1980 included supply-side deregulation, and was quickly followed by the 1982 and 1986 tax reforms. The economy took off, so by the late 1990s economists were seriously writing papers about what to do when the federal debt had all been repaid. Many monetary stabilizations have been tried without fiscal and microeconomic reform. They typically fail after a year or two. The history of Latin America is littered with them (Kehoe and Nicolini 2021).  nbsp;The high interest rates of the early 1980s likely represented a fear that the United States would suffer the same fate. The 1970s were not just a failure of monetary policy. The deficits of the great society and Vietnam War contributed, while the supply “shocks” and productivity slowdown did their part. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span These points are especially important if the 2021 inflation turns in to a sustained 2020s inflation, as the 1971 inflation turned in to a sustained 1970s inflation. For this time, the roots of inflation will most likely be fiscal, a broad change of view that our government really will not eventually reform and repay its debt. The only fundamental answer to that question will be, to reform and set in place a durable structure that will repay debt. Monetary machination will be pointless. nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span A small bout of inflation may be useful to our body politic. Inflation is where dreams of costless fiscal expansion, flooding the country with borrowed money to address every perceived problem, hit a hard brick wall of reality.  nbsp;A small bout of inflation and debt problems may reteach our politicians, officials, and commentariat the classic lessons that  nbsp;there are fiscal limits, fiscal and monetary policy are intertwined, and that a country with solid long-term institutions can borrow, but a country without them is in trouble, and one must allow the golden goose to thrive if one wants to tax her eggs. A small bout of inflation may reteach the same classes that supply matters, incentives matter, and sand in the gears matter.  nbsp;The 1980s reforms only happened because the 1970s were so painful.  nbsp; /p  p  span class= Apple-tab-span  style= white-space: pre;  	 /span In the meantime, however, there is one technical thing the Fed and Treasury can do to forestall a larger crisis: borrow long.  nbsp;Interest costs feed into the budget as debt rolls over. U.S. debt is shockingly short maturity, rolled over on average about every two years. If the United States borrows long-term, then higher interest rates do not raise interest costs on existing debt at all. Shifting to long-term debt would remove one of the main fiscal constraints on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has not helped this fiscal constraint, by transforming a fifth of the federal debt to overnight, floating-rate debt. The 30-year Treasury rate is, as I write 2 percent, about negative 1 percent in real terms. Okay, the 1-year rate is 0.13 percent. As long as this lasts, the government seems to pay lower interest costs.  nbsp;But a 1.87 percent insurance premium to wipe out the danger of a sovereign debt crisis and to buy huge fiscal space to fight inflation seems like a pretty cheap insurance policy. The window of opportunity will not last long, however, as interest rates are already creeping up. nbsp; /p  p  b References /b  /p  p Cochrane, J. H.

This is a longer and more academic piece underlying  The ghost of Christmas inflation.  Video of the conference presentation. This essay in pdf form. FISCAL INFLATION John H. Cochrane From its inflection point in February 2021 to November 2021, the CPI rose 6 percent (278.88/263.161), an 8 percent annualized rate.  Why? Starting in March 2020, in response to the disruptions of Covid-19, the U.S. government created about $3 trillion of new bank reserves, equivalent to cash, and sent checks to people and businesses. (Mechanically, the Treasury issued $3 trillion of new debt, which the Fed quickly bought in return for $3 trillion of new reserves. The Treasury sent out checks, transferring the reserves to people’s banks. See Table 1.)  The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so, and sent more checks. Overall federal debt rose nearly 30 percent. Is it at all a surprise that a year later inflation breaks out?  It is hard to ask for a clearer demonstration of fiscal inflation, an immense fiscal helicopter drop, exhibit A for the fiscal theory of the price level (Cochrane 2022a, 2022b).  What Dropped from the Helicopter? From December 2019 to September 2021, the M2 money stock also increased by $5.6 trillion.  This looks like a monetary, not a fiscal intervention, Milton Friedman’s (1969) classic tale that if you want inflation, drop money from helicopters. But is it monetary or fiscal policy? Ask yourself: Suppose the expansion of M2 had been entirely financed by purchasing Treasury securities. Imagine Treasury debt had declined $5 trillion while M2 and reserves rose $5 trillion. Imagine that there had been no deficit at all, or even a surplus during this period. The monetary theory of inflation, MV=PY, states that we would see the same inflation. Really? Similarly, ask yourself: Suppose that the Federal Reserve had refused to go along. Suppose that the Treasury had sent people Treasury bills directly, accounts at Treasury.gov, along with directions how to sell them if people wished to do so. Better, suppose that the Treasury had created new mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and sent people mutual fund shares. (I write mutual fund as money market funds are counted in M2.) The monetary theory of inflation says again that this would have had no effect. These would be a debt issue, causing no inflation, not a monetary expansion. Really?  Clearly, overall debt matters, not the split of government debt between interest-paying reserves or monetary base and Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve itself is nothing more than an immense money-market fund, offering shares that are pegged at $1 each, pay interest, and are backed by a portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. (Plus, an army of regulators and a huge staff of economists who are supposed to help forecast inflation.)  Milton Friedman’s (1969) helicopter drop is a powerful parable. But a helicopter drop is a fiscal policy, not a monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve may not legally drop money from helicopters; it may not write checks to voters. The Fed may even less vacuum up money; it may not tax people. Helicopter drops and money vacuums are fiscal operations. The Fed may only lend money, or buy and sell assets. To accomplish a helicopter drop in the United States, the Treasury must issue debt, the Fed must buy it with newly printed money, and then the Treasury must drop that money from helicopters, writing it down as a transfer payment. And that is pretty much exactly what happened.  Ask yourself: If, as Friedman’s helicopter is dropping $1,000 on each household, the Fed sends burglars who remove $1,000 of Treasury securities from the same households, would we still see inflation? That’s monetary policy. If Friedman’s helicopter were followed by the Treasury secretary with a bullhorn, shouting “Enjoy your $1,000 in helicopter money. Taxes are going up $1,000 tomorrow,” would we still see inflation?  Friedman’s helicopters are not a monetary change, a substitution of money for debt, an increase in the liquidity of a given set of household assets. They are a “wealth effect” of government debt. Dropping debt from helicopters is a brilliant psychological device for convincing people that the government debt raining down on them will not be repaid by future taxes or spending restraint. It will be left outstanding, so they had better spend it now. Indeed, we just witnessed a “helicopter drop.” But a helicopter drop is fiscal policy.  Why did fiscal inflation not happen sooner? The government has been borrowing money like the proverbial drunken sailor, for decades. The Fed has been buying Treasury securities and turning the debt into reserves for a decade. Why now? Inflation comes when government debt increases, relative to people’s expectations of what the government will repay. If the Treasury borrows, but everyone understands it will later raise tax revenues or cut spending to repay the debt, that debt does not cause inflation. It is a good investment, and people are happy to hold on to it. If the Fed prints up a lot of money, buys Treasury debt, and the Treasury hands out the money, as happened, but everyone understands the Treasury will pay back the debt with future surpluses, the extra money causes no inflation. The Fed can always soak up the money by selling its Treasury securities, and the Treasury repays those securities with surpluses (i.e., taxes less spending).  The 2020–2021 borrowing and money episode was distinctive because, evidently, it came without a corresponding increase in expectations that the government would, someday, raise surpluses by $5 trillion in present value to repay the debt.  Looking in to people’s heads is hard, but why? We can at least find some plausible speculations. One may look to politicians’ statements. Even in the Obama-era “stimulus” spending, the administration emphasized promises of eventual debt reduction. One may chuckle and sneer at promises to repay debts decades after an administration leaves office, but at least they went through the motions to make that promise! Nobody went through any motions about long-run fiscal planning, long-run deficit reduction, and entitlement and tax reform, in 2020–2021.  It was the era of modern monetary theory (MMT), of costless “fiscal expansion” made possible, or so it was claimed, by the manna-from-heaven that interest rates would stay low forever.  The manner of fiscal expansion matters too. When the Treasury borrows in the usual manner, it borrows from established long-term investors, who view Treasury debt as debt that will be repaid and not defaulted or inflated. They view it as a savings or investment vehicle, not as cash to be spent. They save, or invest, based on long and so-far mostly successful experience. This time, following canary-in-the-coal mine disruptions in Treasury markets during March 2020, the Federal Reserve immediately bought new Treasury debt with newly created money, before it even touched these investor’s portfolios. The effect of the operation was to print new money and send people checks, so the debt issue is now held as bank deposits flowing into reserves, rather than as Treasury securities. People holding this new money are likely to spend it rather than regard it as a long-term investment.  In our simplest economic models, it does not matter who holds the debt. But in just a little more nuanced view, who holds the debt matters.  In our simplest economic models, interest-paying reserves and Treasuries are equivalent securities. But people likely do see a difference between reserves and short-run Treasuries. Treasuries may well carry a reputation that they will be repaid, while people assume reserves will not be repaid by larger surpluses. Then issuing lots of reserves rather than Treasuries is inflationary, but not because the reserves are ``money,’’ but rather because they convey a different set of fiscal expectations, just as dropping money or debt from helicopters sends a different signal about repayment than issuing debt at a Treasury auction.Most of the previous operations financed government spending or government worker salaries, counting on higher incomes to slowly filter through the economy. This one sent checks directly to people.   Finally, this fiscal stimulus was enormous, and carried out on a deep misdiagnosis of the state of the economy. Even in simplistic hydraulic Keynesian terms, $5 trillion times any multiplier is much larger than any plausible GDP gap. And the Covid recession was not due to a demand deficiency in the first place. A pandemic is, to the economy, like a huge snowstorm. Sending people money will not get them to go out to closed bars, restaurants, airlines, and businesses. “Stimulus,” “accommodation,” “easing” was the point. This method finally worked, where previous stimulus efforts failed. One can see several suggestive differences, which amount to important economic lessons. What about “supply shocks?” What about a shift of demand from services to durables? Much analysis misses the difference between relative prices and inflation, in which all prices and wages rise together. A supply shock makes one good more expensive than others. Only demand makes all goods rise together. There wouldn’t be “supply chain” problems if people were not trying to buy things like mad! A shift in demand from services to durables can make durable prices go up. But it would make services prices go down. And let us not even go down the ridiculous path of blaming inflation on a sudden contagious outbreak of “greed” and “collusion” by businesses from oil companies to turkey farmers, needing the administration to send the FTC out to investigate.  It is telling that inflation was a complete surprise to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve’s job is supposed to be to monitor the supply capacity of the economy and to make sure demand does not outstrip it.  The Fed failed twice. First, the economy did not need demand-side stimulus. Insurance was wise, and forestalling a financial crisis was necessary. But sending money to every citizen to stoke demand was not. Second, the Fed being surprised by supply shocks is as excusable as the Army losing a battle because its leaders are surprised that the enemy might attack.  As we see by the outcome, the Fed’s understanding of supply, largely based on statistical analysis of labor markets, is rudimentary.   WilI Inflation Continue?  If the government borrows or prints $5 trillion, with no change in its plan to repay debt, on top of $17 trillion outstanding debt, then the price level will rise a cumulative 30 percent, so that the $22 trillion of debt is worth in real terms what the $17 trillion was before. In essence, absent a credible increase in future surpluses, the deficit is financed by defaulting on $5 trillion of outstanding debt, via inflation. By this calculation, the 6 percent or so cumulative inflation we have seen so far leaves a way to go.  But people may think some of the debt will be repaid. If they think half will eventually be repaid, then the price level need only rise 15 percent overall.  But then it stops. A one-time unbacked debt increase leads to a one-time price-level increase, not continuing inflation. Whether inflation continues or not depends on future  monetary policy, future fiscal policy, and whether people change their minds about overall debt repayment.   Fiscal policy may not be done with us yet. If unbacked fiscal expansions continue—that is, borrowing when people do not expect additional repayment—then additional bouts of fiscal inflation will occur. Untold trillions of spending, including new entitlements, with no realistic hope of raising tax revenues commensurately to cover them are certainly high on the Biden administration’s agenda. (Higher tax rates do not necessarily mean higher revenues, if economic growth falters; and even so the proposed taxes do not cover the proposed spending increases even with static scoring.)

If so, even more inflation can break out, seemingly (as always) out of nowhere. Fiscal Constraints on Monetary Policy  Fiscal and monetary policies are always intertwined in causing or curing inflation. Even in a pure fiscal theory of the price level, monetary policy (setting interest rates) can control the path of expected future inflation. Thus, whether inflation continues or not also depends on how monetary policy reacts to this fiscal shock and its consequences.  Whether the Fed will do something about it is an obvious concern. The Fed’s habits and new operating procedures, formed before 2019 in a Maginot Line against perpetual below-target inflation, look remarkably like the Fed of about 1971: Let inflation blow hot to march down the Phillips curve to greater employment, wait for inflation to exceed target for a while before doing anything about it, talk about “transitory” and “supply” shocks to excuse each error. The Fed understands “expectations” now, unlike in 1971, but seems to view them as a third force amenable to management by “forward guidance” speeches rather than formed by a hardy and skeptical experience with the Fed’s concrete actions. The Fed likes to say it has “the tools” to contain inflation, but never dares to say just what those tools are.  In recent U.S. historical experience, the Fed’s tool is to replay 1980: 20 percent interest rates, a bruising recession hurting the disadvantaged especially, and the medicine applied for as long as it takes. Will our Fed really do that? Will our Congress let our Fed do that? Can you deter an enemy without revealing what’s in your arsenal and whether you will use it? If the Fed needs to fight inflation, fiscal constraints on monetary policy will play a large and unexpected role. In 1980, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 25 percent. Today it is 100 percent, and rising swiftly. Fiscal constraints on monetary policy are four times larger today, and counting.  For a rise in interest rates to lower inflation, fiscal policy must tighten as well. Without that fiscal cooperation, monetary policy cannot lower inflation. There are two important channels of this interconnection.  First, the rise in interest rates raises interest costs on the debt. The government must  pay those higher interest costs, by raising tax revenues and cutting spending, or by credibly promising to do so in the future. At 100 percent debt to GDP, 5 percentage points higher interest rates mean an additional deficit of 5 percent of GDP or $1 trillion, for every year that high interest rates continue.  This consideration is especially relevant if the underlying cause of the inflation is fiscal policy. If we are having inflation because people don’t believe that the government can pay off the deficits it is running to send people checks, and it will not reform the looming larger entitlement promises, then people will not believe that the government can pay off an additional $1 trillion deficit to pay interest costs on the debt.  In a fiscally driven inflation, it can happen that the central bank raises rates to fight inflation, which raises the deficit via interest costs, and thereby only makes inflation worse. This has, for example, been an analysis of several episodes in Brazil. Second, if monetary policy lowers inflation, then bondholders earn a real windfall. Fiscal policy must tighten to pay this windfall.  People who bought 10-year Treasury bonds in September of 1981 got a 15.84 percent yield, as markets expected inflation to continue. From September 1981 to September 1991, the CPI grew at a 3.9 percent average rate. By this back of the envelope calculation, those bondholders got an amazing 12 percent annual real return. That return came completely and entirely courtesy of U.S. taxpayers.  The 1986 tax reform and deregulation, which allowed the United States to grow strongly for 20 years, eventually did produce fiscal surpluses that nearly repaid U.S. federal debt. At 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio, each 5 percentage point reduction in the price level requires another 5 percent of GDP fiscal surplus.  Ask yourself, if inflation gets built into bond yields, and the Fed tries to lower inflation, will our Congress really raise tax revenues or cut spending in order to finance an unexpected (by definition) and undeserved (it will surely be argued) windfall profit to wealthy investors, foreign central bankers, and fat-cats on Wall Street?  If it does not do so, the monetary attempt at disinflation fails.  We state too casually that that the United States will always repay its debts, and prioritize that repayment over all else. We should not take such probity for granted. For example, in the 2021 debt ceiling discussion, it stated as fact by all concerned, from the Treasury to Congress to the White House, that hitting the debt ceiling must trigger a formal default. That is untrue. The United States could easily prioritize its tax revenues to repaying interest and principal on outstanding debt, by cutting other spending instead. Painful, yes. Impossible, no. That the U.S. contingency plan for a binding debt ceiling is formal default tells you that the spirit of Alexander Hamilton, preaching the sanctity of debt repayment to build reputation so we can borrow in the future, is truly dead. And with inflation, we are not even talking about formal default. The question is, will the United States undertake a sharp fiscal austerity to support monetary policy in the fight against inflation, by paying higher interest costs on the debt and by repaying bondholders in more valuable money?  Or will the government just repay as promised, but in dollars that are worth more than expected? If the government does the latter, monetary policy fails.  There is a third troublesome requirement for higher nominal interest rates to produce lower inflation. One needs an economic model in which this is true, that model needs to be correct, and its preconditions need to be met.  It’s not as easy as it sounds, because in the long run, when real interest rates settle down, higher nominal interest rates must come with higher, not lower inflation. So you need an understanding of how and when things work the other direction in the short run.  In standard new-Keynesian models, used by all central banks, for example, higher interest rates only produce lower inflation if the higher interest rate is unexpected—that is, a “shock” to the economy—and if there is a sharp contemporaneous fiscal contraction, for the above reasons.   A widely expected rise in nominal interest rates raises inflation.  A rise in interest rates without the corresponding ``austerity’’ raises inflation.  Both preconditions are questionable today. More complex ingredients, such as long-term debt or financial frictions, can allow a higher nominal rate to temporarily lower inflation. But reliance on more complex ingredients and frictions is also dangerous. The Future The future is not hopeless. Inflation control simply requires our government, including the central bank, to understand classic lessons of history. Forestalling inflation is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Stabilizing inflation once it gets out of control is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Expectations are “anchored” if people believe such policy is in place, and politicians and Fed officials are ready to act if needed.  I add “micro-economic,” as it is perhaps the most frequently overlooked adjective. Fiscal surpluses do not result from sharply higher tax rates, especially of a tax system so riven with economic distortions as ours. Fiscal surpluses can come from spending restraint, but that too is difficult. The best road to fiscal surpluses is strong economic growth, which increases the tax base and lowers the need for social spending.   In the conundrum between taxes and spending, there is a way out: raise long-term economic growth. And there is only one way to do that: to increase the supply-side capacity of the economy. That is, however, just as politically controversial as the first two options. Most of the job is to get out of the way. Most economic regulation is designed to transfer incomes, to protect various interests, or to push on the scales of bilateral negotiation, to undo the harsh siren of economic incentives, in a way that stifles economic growth. Many interests hate pro-growth legislation and regulation just as much as they hate taxes and spending cuts. The r g crowd has a point, but increasing g is the answer.  Much of the “supply shocks” of 2021 come down to the “great resignation”—that is,  the puzzling decline in labor force participation despite a labor shortage. The work disincentives of social programs—paying people not to work, bluntly—are laid bare.  All successful inflation stabilizations have combined monetary, fiscal, and micro-economic reforms. I emphasize reforms. In most cases the tax system is reformed to provide more revenue with less distortion. The structure of spending programs is reformed to help people in need more efficiently without work disincentives. Regulations are reformed, though they hurt the profits of incumbents, to increase entry, competition and innovation.  The policy regime is changed, durably. Reversible decisions and pie-crust promises do not do much to change the present value of surpluses, to raise the government’s ability to pledge a long stream of surpluses to support debt.  1980 did not succeed in the United States from monetary toughness only.  1980 included supply-side deregulation, and was quickly followed by the 1982 and 1986 tax reforms. The economy took off, so by the late 1990s economists were seriously writing papers about what to do when the federal debt had all been repaid. Many monetary stabilizations have been tried without fiscal and microeconomic reform. They typically fail after a year or two. The history of Latin America is littered with them (Kehoe and Nicolini 2021).  The high interest rates of the early 1980s likely represented a fear that the United States would suffer the same fate. The 1970s were not just a failure of monetary policy. The deficits of the great society and Vietnam War contributed, while the supply “shocks” and productivity slowdown did their part.  These points are especially important if the 2021 inflation turns in to a sustained 2020s inflation, as the 1971 inflation turned in to a sustained 1970s inflation. For this time, the roots of inflation will most likely be fiscal, a broad change of view that our government really will not eventually reform and repay its debt. The only fundamental answer to that question will be, to reform and set in place a durable structure that will repay debt. Monetary machination will be pointless.  A small bout of inflation may be useful to our body politic. Inflation is where dreams of costless fiscal expansion, flooding the country with borrowed money to address every perceived problem, hit a hard brick wall of reality.  A small bout of inflation and debt problems may reteach our politicians, officials, and commentariat the classic lessons that  there are fiscal limits, fiscal and monetary policy are intertwined, and that a country with solid long-term institutions can borrow, but a country without them is in trouble, and one must allow the golden goose to thrive if one wants to tax her eggs. A small bout of inflation may reteach the same classes that supply matters, incentives matter, and sand in the gears matter.  The 1980s reforms only happened because the 1970s were so painful.   In the meantime, however, there is one technical thing the Fed and Treasury can do to forestall a larger crisis: borrow long.  Interest costs feed into the budget as debt rolls over. U.S. debt is shockingly short maturity, rolled over on average about every two years. If the United States borrows long-term, then higher interest rates do not raise interest costs on existing debt at all. Shifting to long-term debt would remove one of the main fiscal constraints on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has not helped this fiscal constraint, by transforming a fifth of the federal debt to overnight, floating-rate debt. The 30-year Treasury rate is, as I write 2 percent, about negative 1 percent in real terms. Okay, the 1-year rate is 0.13 percent. As long as this lasts, the government seems to pay lower interest costs.  But a 1.87 percent insurance premium to wipe out the danger of a sovereign debt crisis and to buy huge fiscal space to fight inflation seems like a pretty cheap insurance policy. The window of opportunity will not last long, however, as interest rates are already creeping up. ReferencesCochrane, J. H.

Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.Issue 30, 50 and 100 year bonds, This comment has been removed by the author.Increase the duration of the debt is the answer. I thought Greenspan was wrong when he went focused on lowering duration and concentrating on 10 year notes rather than 30 yr bonds. Issue 30, 50, and 100 year bonds. America might be the only country that could get that done at low interest rates. Greenspan wasn t Treasury Secretary at that time.You can lay the responsibility for that choice at the feet of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy Larry Summers.No, issue perpetuities! And fixed-for-floating swaps!  Clearly, overall debt matters, not the split of government debt between interest-paying reserves or monetary base and Treasury securities. Apparently not since perpetuities would count toward the overall debt level. To accomplish a helicopter drop in the United States, the Treasury must issue debt, the Fed must buy it with newly printed money, and then the Treasury must drop that money from helicopters, writing it down as a transfer payment. And that is pretty much exactly what happened. And how do perpetuities or 100 year bonds prevent the Fed from buying them with newly printed money? Perhaps Treasury should sell something (for instance equity) that the Fed can t legally purchase? One may look to politicians’ statements. Even in the Obama-era stimulus spending, the administration emphasized promises of eventual debt reduction. No it didn t. The Obama administration s  stimulus  was primarily a debt swap (private banking debt for public Treasury debt). You can see it in TCMDO here:Change units to year over year percentage growth. Total debt (public and private) grew at 10.5% y/y in fourth quarter of 2007 and then stayed between 2% and 4% for all of Obama s administration (2008-2016).This comment has been removed by the author.That s what the government is already doing: issuing perpetuities. Since, as you said in your post, nobody is expecting the government paying back the debt ever, it is issuing perpetuities.True, the perpetuities the government is issuing now include a  feature : they have  liquidity windows  on which the government will attempt, on a best effort basis, to find other investors that provide the liquidity the bonds you hold today. Since the risk is all on the hands of the present investors (they have no collateral to claim and no assets will be seized if the government fails to find new suckers in those liquidity windows) this feature is, mostly, irrelevant and does not make a big difference with actual perpetuities.El Emperador,True perpetuities have no roll over or redemption date.The petpetuities that the central bank is issuing are the FRN s that they use to purchase the Treasury bonds.I think that if the US tries to place perpetuities right now it would fail. No one will take that duration risk in a new thin market (well maybe Goldman would stuff it into their customer s portfolios). It may be seen as a sign that an adult is in charge at Treasury, or seen as a sign that the Government is finally seeing the problems above and preparing for a crisis.  JC - The 1980s reforms only happened because the 1970s were so painful. The other  reform  that happened in the 1990 s was that Bob Rubin and Larry Summers while at the Treasury decided to shorten the term structure of the Federal debt to help reduce interest expenditures and bring federal expenditures (including interest payments) in line with federal receipts. JC - In the meantime, however, there is one technical thing the Fed and Treasury can do to forestall a larger crisis: borrow long. So the plan is for the Treasury to borrow long until the necessary  reforms  are enacted by a future Congress and Treasury and one of those  reforms  is for a future Treasury to reduce the term structure of the federal debt? The 1986 tax reform and deregulation, which allowed the United States to grow strongly for 20 years, eventually did produce fiscal surpluses that nearly repaid U.S. federal debt. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986 The act lowered federal income tax rates, decreasing the number of tax brackets and reducing the top tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1993 The act increased the top federal income tax rate from 31% to 39.6%, increased the corporate income tax rate, raised fuel taxes, and raised various other taxes. If by eventually, you mean that the top marginal tax rate was  eventually  raised from 28% up to 39.6%, after being lowered from 50% to 28%, then yes the 1986 tax reform  led  to eventual surpluses.Much of the “supply shocks” of 2021 come down to the “great resignation”—that is, the puzzling decline in labor force participation despite a labor shortage. The work disincentives of social programs—paying people not to work, bluntly—are laid bare.Well...The CIVRATE has dropped for a few reasons;1. The pandemic accelerated retirement for a large chunk of baby boomers. 2. Women leaving the workforce to take care of children because schools and daycares being unavailable. Women still have the highest demand for temporal flexibility. 3. Fear of returning to work for fear of getting infected. Not an unreasonable fear. Guilting and shaming people back to work is rarely useful.4. A game of chicken between employers and employees. The demand for temporal flexibility is increasing amongst both genders. Non-pecuniary benefits are becoming more important. Who will flinch first? The fiscal helicopter drops weren t just for saving consumption. It was used to pay rent and also to pay down debt. As the blizzard is largely over, yes, those with cash in hand need an asbestos wallet so it doesn t burn a hole in their pockets. But the labor shortages are creating cost push inflation on top of demand pull. But let s not lay the blame for the dysfunctional labor market at the feet of the fiscal side for plugging a huge hole due to lockdowns.  From December 2019 to September 2021, the M2 money stock also increased by $5.6 trillion. This looks like a monetary, not a fiscal intervention, Milton Friedman’s (1969) classic tale that if you want inflation, drop money from helicopters. But is it monetary or fiscal policy? Ask yourself: Suppose the expansion of M2 had been entirely financed by purchasing Treasury securities. Imagine Treasury debt had declined $5 trillion while M2 and reserves rose $5 trillion. Imagine that there had been no deficit at all, or even a surplus during this period. The monetary theory of inflation, MV=PY, states that we would see the same inflation. Really? Similarly, ask yourself: Suppose that the Federal Reserve had refused to go along. Suppose that the Treasury had sent people Treasury bills directly, accounts at Treasury.gov, along with directions how to sell them if people wished to do so. Better, suppose that the Treasury had created new mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and sent people mutual fund shares. (I write mutual fund as money market funds are counted in M2.) The monetary theory of inflation says again that this would have had no effect. These would be a debt issue, causing no inflation, not a monetary expansion. Really? I feel like this is a really important paragraph of the article. All else equal, I would prefer more in depth discussion on how the fiscal theory and monetary theory differ. The  Really? s in it make me a bit suspicious that I am not getting the full story. I worry that someone who believes the monetary theory might argue that this does not represent their views. The truth is that borrowing activities in general have inflationary effects. In the past when most borrowings are in the form of bank loans, monetary aggregates are a good proxy of borrowing activities (since loans create deposits which go into M2). Nowadays that bonds player a much greater role, bond issuances (including by the government which is fiscal policy) are also inflationary, even when they just involve transfer of money between non-bank sectors (and hence do not affect M2). For example, if I have $100 deposit at a bank. I borrow $100 from the bank, and use it to buy a sandwich from a shop, who deposits the $100 at the same bank. So sandwich price goes up, and M2 goes up by $100.Now if I buy $100 of bills issued by the government, who pays $100 to the sandwich shop, and the shop then deposits the money at the same bank. So sandwich price goes up while total deposits (M2) say the same. dollars that are worth more than expected  -   dollars that are worth less than expected ?For once that s not a typo. In 1980, 10 year rates rose to 15%, as people expected inflation to stay that high. When inflation fell to 3%, the bondholders got paid back in dollars worth more than they had expected. I could have phrased that more clearly. You had me at...  Ask yourself: If, as Friedman’s helicopter is dropping $1,000 on each household, the Fed sends burglars who remove $1,000 of Treasury securities from the same household . Pure gold (no pun intended).as I have kids I find this immensely depressing! I see people thinking this is the Best of Times...like Wall Street bankers, bitcoiners, Billionaires, Democrats....This is WORST OF TIMES! Anyone thinking person knows this will end REALLY REALLY BADMMT stand for Modern Monetary Theory? I thought it stood for Magical Monetary Theory. My mistake, I guess.Or Nagical Money Tree. It s a structural shift away from Monetary policy to the Fiscal side. Problem is that assuming taxes will take out excess supply and then redistribute all over again? I have doubts about that mechanism but maybe I got it wrong. There will still be tax avoidance and evasion. At least with NY s OMO office, supply can be adjusted with mechanisms that generally  work.  The one upside to at least trying out MMT is that if it doesn t work, the stake can be put in the vampire relatively easily. The effectiveness lag of Fiscal is immediate compared to that of the Fed. But the Fed wins on the implementation side. Raising taxes or reducing spending strikes me as being two sides of the same coin. Either way, somebody s ox is going to get gored. More importantly, politicians are loath to take anything away from their voters that might affect their reelection chances. While many voices will decry inflation, in all likelihood, politicians will do what they have always done - nothing - pass the buck (literally) and hope that we can somehow inflate our way out of this problem. And, if the GOP is successful in retaking Congress and the White House, it seems unlikely that will do anything more than keep spending.As a New Year s sentiment let me say how much I have enjoyed these blogs by John Cochrane over the years.As a layman, I find myself swayed but not convinced by the last arguments I read by any prominent macroeconomist.I wish you guys would come up with a common perspective.John reminds me of a gentlemen I met in the grocery store.Each day he would ask the cashier in the produce section if they have fresh pomegranates. The cashier would kindly respond to the gentleman that they have bottled pomegranate juice (POM Wonderful or some other variety) but do not carry fresh pomegranates.One day the same gentleman asks the same question again. To my surprise the cashier points to a section of the produce department and indicates that yes they now carry fresh pomegranates. The gentleman walks back to that section, looks over the selection of pomegranates and then walks away.My curiousity peaked, I walk over to the gentleman and ask him why he didn t purchase any. He replies that he doesn t care for pomegranates at all.Let s do a test. (1) Inflation was rising in 1965-66, and the Fed tightened. Meanwhile, the budget deficit got larger from LBJ guns-and-butter budget. Inflation fell. Sounds like Fed tightening mattered, not the deficit.LBJ literally slammed Fed Chair Martin against the wall at his ranch. Talk about fiscal dominance! Martin eased, and inflation rose. (2) Reagan cut taxes and increased defense spending, and the deficit surged. Meanwhile, Volcker tightened to the max, and we had a recession and inflation plunged. Fed tightening mattered. The deficit did not. (3) We had a gigantic deficit in 2009 with no promise to pay it off. That is how we got TEA Party protests. But inflation turned in deflation. A negative shock to aggregate demand could be the explanation. Fiscal theory doesn t cut it. FTPL seems to depend on expectations of future austerity. But we have no way to measure such expectations. It becomes a non-testable conjecture. The confusion of monetary and fiscal policies seem to happen when the overnight rate is zero, which blurs the distinction between money and Tbills. I am being pedantic, but here goes.You talk about a five percent increase in interest rates.Are you really thinking about a five percentage point rise in interest rates? Those two sentences are not the same thing. You are correct, and I should write percentage points. That s accuracy not pedantry! Your support for accuracy is commendable. ThanksThe economy runs on energy not the various intermediate goods. Debt is a IOU on future energy. It would appear that continued growth in future energy is questionable. Some seem to be saying that the off book government debt will also be a problem. The Fed is using Ducktape to hold things together in the face of energy depletion. Growth proponents need an appendix to detail where the required resources will come from. Two other notes re perpetuities: if the Treasury were to issue perpetuities it would have to come up with an iron-clad guarantee that it would not borrow more than say x % of total debt (50%?) in short term instruments ever again, else what would be the point (aside for paradoxically enabling even more reckless borrowing). TY will also have to swap in or retire existing short term debt subject to this rule as well to get to this operating point. A proposal would have to have teeth too, though, as everyone would know that when the next Build Back Better is proposed and congress starts looking in the couch cushions for coins to pretend to cover spending, they will borrow again at the front of the curve to shave a couple of basis points on the projected interest.As to credibility- Yellen would have been the ideal candidate to show a TY sec with spine managing the term structure of the GOVT debt, but I must admit I am very disappointed in Yellen so far: seems she not only drinks the Kool-Aid, she is now pouring it.Second, can you issue perpetuities when interest rates are so incredibly low? Say they are issued at 2.5% coupon, it is definitely in the realm of possibility to have yields go to 5%, in which case there will be a massive capital loss for holders. And who will scoop up the perpetuities -- as it is govt debt, most likely it will be sucked in as a  safe asset  in insurance companies and retirement portfolios. Basel will probably encourage it, too.Does anyone have a link that explains this in more detail? I vaguely remember this from my economics courses, but I couldn t find anything after more than an hour of Googling. Thanks!In standard new-Keynesian models, used by all central banks, for example, higher interest rates only produce lower inflation if the higher interest rate is unexpected—that is, a “shock” to the economy . . .A widely expected rise in nominal interest rates raises inflation.  An earlier blog post explains this, https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2021/09/inflation-in-shadow-of-debt.htmlThis comment has been removed by the author.Thank you! However, I believe that post explains why the interest rate increase must be accompanied by fiscal tightening. I m trying to understand why the interest rate increase must be unexpected rather than widely expected. Does anyone have a link? Thank you very much!An expected interest rate increase is already priced in to bonds. And an expected fiscal tightening can t unexpectedly devalue bonds.  If the government borrows or prints $5 trillion, with no change in its plan to repay debt, on top of $17 trillion outstanding debt, then the price level will rise a cumulative 30 percent, so that the $22 trillion of debt is worth in real terms what the $17 trillion was before. In essence, absent a credible increase in future surpluses, the deficit is financed by defaulting on $5 trillion of outstanding debt, via inflation. It seems that recent reality has had the trillions going directly into the price levels.The share price levels of the FAANG market capitalization increases.Apple is now a $3 trillion company, and there are a few other $ trillion companies.The gov t spends $5 trillion, paying off donors and  doing good , and the 5 largest companies all increase their market cap by $1 trillion. This looks like what has been happening for the last decade, with the new Biden choices to reduce energy supply (higher prices! feeding thru all prices) and enforce vax mandates to fire millions of workers and to supply helicopter money to help folks have more to spend.If the Treasury started trading out its short term debt for long term debt, wouldn’t that immediately spook markets and signal that the Treasury doesn’t think it can repay its debts? I’m just wondering whether the chosen maturity of Treasury debt has effects on market expectations and beliefs.This comment has been removed by the author.One of my favourite blofComments are welcome.

		<title>Weekend reads on the state of America -- and China</title>
		<description> p Two pieces stood out from some weekend internet meandering. nbsp; /p  p  a href= https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/01/dan-wangs-2021-letter.html  target= _blank  Marginal Revolution /a  nbsp;points to an excellent  a href= https://danwang.co/2021-letter/  target= _blank  long letter from Dan Wang /a  nbsp;on China. /p  p A trenchant part of Dan s essay is, curiously, a few reflections on America. Not bad for living in Shanghai: nbsp; /p  blockquote  p The US, for starters, should get better at reform. The federal government has found itself unable to build simple infrastructure or coordinate an effective pandemic response. Somehow the US has evolved to become a political system in which people can dream up a hundred reasons not to do things like “build housing in growing areas” or “admit people with skills into the country.” If the US wants to win a decades-long challenge against a peer competitor, it needs to be able to improve state capacity. ... /p  /blockquote  blockquote  p Since the US government is incapable of structural reform, companies now employ algorithm geniuses to help people navigate the healthcare system. This sort of seventh-best solution is typical of a vetocracy. I don’t see that the US government is trying hard to reform institutions; its response is usually to make things more complex (like its healthcare legislation) or throw money at the problem. The proposed bill to increase domestic competitiveness against China, for example, doesn’t substantially fix the science funding agencies that are more concerned with style guides than science; and the infrastructure bill doesn’t seem to address root causes that make American infrastructure the most costly in the world. Congress is sending more money through bad channels. /p  /blockquote  p  nbsp;Stop and savor. nbsp; span  /span  /p  a name= more   /a  p  /p  p In the  strategic competition  with China, nbsp; /p  blockquote  p .. the US has demonstrated a superb capacity for self-harm... Entrepreneurial firms in China previously had no time for domestic technologies, preferring instead to buy the best, which is usually American. Then the US government designated them to various blacklists, giving them for the first time ever a business case for building up the domestic ecosystem. The result is that the US has turbo-charged Chinese competition by aligning the country’s most dynamic firms more firmly with Beijing’s self-sufficiency agenda. And in December, I wrote a piece for the Atlantic on US prosecutions of scientists. The state has subjected scientists to the tender mercies of the US criminal justice system, usually for charges related to relatively unimportant issues implicating research integrity. .. /p  /blockquote  blockquote  p One redeeming fact for the US is that there has been significant domestic pushback to some of the government’s actions—especially the prosecutions of scientists—such that it’s within the realm of imagination that the US government will substantially modify bad policies. This sort of correction after public criticism is more difficult in China, where critics might end up jailed. The US though should take more seriously the task of cultivating both strong entrepreneurs and a strong state. /p  /blockquote  div A strong state, a strong civil society, and a strong scientific / technocratic establishment are  nbsp;ones that allow and responds to criticism that deviates from The Narrative. Here and in China. nbsp; /div  p Back to China, the point of the letter. Regional differences and the power of local governments are quite interesting. I can t effectively summarize observations on Beijing vs. Shanghai vs. Hong Kong vs. nbsp;Shenzhen, so do read the original. nbsp; /p  blockquote  p Beijing’s control tendency isn’t the only story in this country. That spirit is resented by Shanghai and Shenzhen, which mediates it with their commercial tendencies. Pushback from local governments can occasionally mitigate Beijing’s worst ideas. Shanghai and Shenzhen are also sometimes able to help improve the institutional capacity in Beijing. nbsp; /p  /blockquote  p On the recent regulatory crackdown: nbsp; /p  blockquote  p When Beijing punished Ant Financial and DiDi, all of us were nervous that these companies were pawns in a game of elite politics whose rules aren’t revealed to anyone who isn’t a player. At this point, however, the punishment of these two firms looks rather small compared to everything that happened afterwards: the decapitation of online tutoring, new restrictions on video games, anti-monopoly actions against internet platforms, and passage of statutes governing data and privacy. /p  /blockquote  blockquote  p No small number of commentators have pointed out that any individual regulation passes muster on technocratic grounds. The US and Europe after all are debating rules with similar shapes—although they would never implement them with China’s speed and severity. I agree both with the commentators who see a sound technocratic foundation for these rules as well as with commentators like Naughton who note that they add up to an unprecedented new program of political control on firms.

Hong Kong was also the most bureaucratic city I’ve ever lived in. Its business landscape has remained static for decades: the preserve of property developers that has created no noteworthy companies in the last three decades. That is a heritage of British colonial rule, in which administrators controlled economic elites by allocating land—the city’s most scarce resource—to the more docile. Hong Kong bureaucrats enforce the pettiest rules, I felt, out of a sense of pride. On the mainland, enforcers deal often enough with senseless rules that they are sometimes able to look the other way. Thus a stagnant spirit hangs over the city. /p  /blockquote  blockquote  p ...Beijing locals have adapted to the proliferation of rules not with complete obedience, but discernment of which can be safely ignored. nbsp; /p  /blockquote  p Chinese exports, brands, and quality: nbsp; /p  blockquote  p Chinese firms have not created many global brands, but I have confidence that will change.

Last year, it expelled the cream of the western reporting corps for a reason still hard to believe today—that the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal published an insensitive headline—such that only a handful of reporters remain on the ground between the Journal, the Times, and the Post.

		<text>John Cochrane s blogTwo pieces stood out from some weekend internet meandering. Marginal Revolution points to an excellent long letter from Dan Wang on China.A trenchant part of Dan s essay is, curiously, a few reflections on America. Not bad for living in Shanghai: The US, for starters, should get better at reform. The federal government has found itself unable to build simple infrastructure or coordinate an effective pandemic response. Somehow the US has evolved to become a political system in which people can dream up a hundred reasons not to do things like “build housing in growing areas” or “admit people with skills into the country.” If the US wants to win a decades-long challenge against a peer competitor, it needs to be able to improve state capacity. ...Since the US government is incapable of structural reform, companies now employ algorithm geniuses to help people navigate the healthcare system. This sort of seventh-best solution is typical of a vetocracy. I don’t see that the US government is trying hard to reform institutions; its response is usually to make things more complex (like its healthcare legislation) or throw money at the problem. The proposed bill to increase domestic competitiveness against China, for example, doesn’t substantially fix the science funding agencies that are more concerned with style guides than science; and the infrastructure bill doesn’t seem to address root causes that make American infrastructure the most costly in the world. Congress is sending more money through bad channels. Stop and savor. In the  strategic competition  with China, .. the US has demonstrated a superb capacity for self-harm... Entrepreneurial firms in China previously had no time for domestic technologies, preferring instead to buy the best, which is usually American. Then the US government designated them to various blacklists, giving them for the first time ever a business case for building up the domestic ecosystem. The result is that the US has turbo-charged Chinese competition by aligning the country’s most dynamic firms more firmly with Beijing’s self-sufficiency agenda. And in December, I wrote a piece for the Atlantic on US prosecutions of scientists. The state has subjected scientists to the tender mercies of the US criminal justice system, usually for charges related to relatively unimportant issues implicating research integrity. ..One redeeming fact for the US is that there has been significant domestic pushback to some of the government’s actions—especially the prosecutions of scientists—such that it’s within the realm of imagination that the US government will substantially modify bad policies. This sort of correction after public criticism is more difficult in China, where critics might end up jailed. The US though should take more seriously the task of cultivating both strong entrepreneurs and a strong state.Back to China, the point of the letter. Regional differences and the power of local governments are quite interesting. I can t effectively summarize observations on Beijing vs. Shanghai vs. Hong Kong vs. Shenzhen, so do read the original. Beijing’s control tendency isn’t the only story in this country. That spirit is resented by Shanghai and Shenzhen, which mediates it with their commercial tendencies. Pushback from local governments can occasionally mitigate Beijing’s worst ideas. Shanghai and Shenzhen are also sometimes able to help improve the institutional capacity in Beijing. On the recent regulatory crackdown: When Beijing punished Ant Financial and DiDi, all of us were nervous that these companies were pawns in a game of elite politics whose rules aren’t revealed to anyone who isn’t a player. At this point, however, the punishment of these two firms looks rather small compared to everything that happened afterwards: the decapitation of online tutoring, new restrictions on video games, anti-monopoly actions against internet platforms, and passage of statutes governing data and privacy.No small number of commentators have pointed out that any individual regulation passes muster on technocratic grounds. The US and Europe after all are debating rules with similar shapes—although they would never implement them with China’s speed and severity. I agree both with the commentators who see a sound technocratic foundation for these rules as well as with commentators like Naughton who note that they add up to an unprecedented new program of political control on firms. Beijing expects companies to comply not only with formal regulations but also to a broader ideological agenda.We will see how much US regulation of internet companies also forces conformity with an ideological agenda. Hong Kong is no longer Milton Friedman s free market paradise: ...

Whatever you may think of him, Mark Levin has a book called  Unfreedom of the Press , published way before Kim s essay.In general, I agree with the thrust of this post.There is also the matter of $6 trillion spent in counterproductive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.No one plans a military invasion of the U.S. Yet Washington outlays $1.4 trillion annually in defense costs (DoD, VA, DHS, black budget, pro-rated interest on the national debt). That is about $4200 for every man, woman, child and trans in the country, or almost $17,000 for a family of four.$17,000! And next year, and the year after that and into perpetuity will be even more.Reform? Alas, no, no, no. This is a lament, a garbage lament. Since the US government is incapable of structural reform ...  Christ almighty, that s how it was designed. Do a reform and get a civil war, one on each issue.And, yes, the media here are different. There is more than one.None of us need agree. It s variety, competition, and free choice that matter. And we still have it.The essay was interesting, but how much of it is credible and how much falls into the incredible category?  A strong state, a strong civil society, and a strong scientific / technocratic establishment are ones that allow and responds to criticism that deviates from The Narrative. Here and in China. --this is a fallacy. You won t find the  allow...deviates from the  The Narrative  ; but, you ll have plenty of  responds to criticism that deviates from  The Narrative  , as in disappearing the deviates.  A strong scientific/technocratic establishment  is a oligarchy of technocrats that set the norms and mores for those they admit to the establishment (guild-like). The admonition today is  Follow the Science!  It gets worse with the passage of time. Phrases such as  Climate Crisis ,  Climate Change Emergency! , etc., are intended to buffalo the unwary, the ignorant and the gulible. It s succeeding.Dan Wong s essay describes some of the nature of that technocratic/scientific, strong state, etc., apparatus. He doesn t touch on the more controversial aspects of that social order which have been described in the western press. It s a totalist state, and as was demonstrated by the example made of Jack Ma, it has a long arm and it is willing to take arbitrary measures to rein in activities that do not conform to the established norms and mores of the state leadership.In the USA, we see a concerted effort guided by a handful of senators to overturn established order in the regulatory agencies governing the US financial sector. It s a mini version of the totalist state control that pervades the PRC. It s succeeding because no one, as yet, has mounted a concentrated response to counter it.Be careful what you wish for--you may get more of it than you bargained.Wang s arguments are just terrible. It is obvious why it appeared in the Atlantic. ....oft-times after failing “fact-checks” by the friendly people at Good Thoughtkeeping. Perfect!Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

		<title>The Ghost of Christmas Inflation</title>
		<description> p This is part of an ongoing series of essays on inflation.  nbsp;This one is at  a href= https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-fiscal-inflation-5-trillion-stimulus-by-john-h-cochrane-2021-12?utm_source=twitter amp;utm_medium=organic-social amp;utm_campaign=page-posts-december21 amp;utm_post-type=link amp;utm_format=16%3A9 amp;utm_creative=link-image amp;utm_post-date=2021-12-23  target= _blank  Project Syndicate /a .  a href= https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/01/fiscal-inflation.html  target= _blank  The next post /a  is somewhat longer and more academic with the same themes. nbsp; /p  p style= text-align: center;  The Ghost of Christmas Inflation /p  p Inflation continues to surge. From its inflection point in February 2021 to last month, the US consumer price index has grown 6% – an 8% annualized rate. nbsp; /p  p The underlying cause is no mystery. Starting in March 2020, the US government created about $3 trillion of new bank reserves (an equivalent to cash) and sent checks to people and businesses. The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so and sent even more checks. The total stimulus comes to about 25% of GDP, and to around 30% of the original federal debt. While much of the money went to help people and businesses severely hurt by the pandemic, much of it was also sent regardless of need, intended as stimulus (or “accommodation”) to stoke demand. The goal was to induce people to spend, and that is what they are now doing. nbsp; /p  p Milton Friedman once said that if you want inflation, you can just drop money from helicopters. That is basically what the US government has done. But this US inflation is ultimately fiscal, not monetary. People do not have an excess of money relative to bonds; rather, people have extra savings and extra apparent wealth to spend. Had the government borrowed the entire $5 trillion to write the same checks, we likely would have the same inflation. nbsp; /p  p  span  /span  /p  a name= more   /a Other purported factors – including “supply shocks,” “bottlenecks,” “demand shifts,” and corporate “greed” – are not relevant to the overall price level. The ports would not be clogged if people were not trying to buy lots of goods. If people wanted more TVs and fewer restaurant meals, the price of TVs would go up and the price of restaurant meals would go down. Greed did not suddenly break out last year. nbsp; p  /p  p By contrast, inflation, when all prices and wages rise together, comes from the balance of overall supply and demand. The economy’s capacity to produce goods and services turns out to be lower than expected. Here, the labor shortage – the “Great Resignation” – is a key underlying fact. Employers can’t find people to work because many people remain on the sidelines, not even looking for jobs. nbsp; /p  p The US Federal Reserve was completely surprised by the surge of inflation, and through most of the year insisted it would be “transitory,” and go away on its own. That turned out to be a major institutional failure. Is it not the Fed’s main job to understand the economy’s supply capacity and fill – but not overfill – the cup of demand? nbsp; /p  p One might expect that among the thousands of economists the Fed employs, there is a group working on figuring out ports’ capacity, the effects of microchip shortages, how many people have retired or are not returning to work, and so forth. One would be disappointed. Central banks have sketchy ideas of supply, mostly centered on statistical trends in labor markets. nbsp; /p  p Why did this fiscal stimulus produce inflation when previous stimulus efforts from 2008 to 2020 fizzled? There are several obvious possibilities. First, this stimulus was much bigger. Former US Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers  a href= https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/24/inflation-risk-is-real/  target= _blank  correctly prophesied /a  inflation in March [Update: February] 2021 by simply looking at the immense size of the spending packages, relative to any reasonable estimate of the GDP shortfall. nbsp; /p  p Second, officials misunderstood the COVID recession. GDP and employment did not fall because there was a lack of “demand.” In a pandemic, you can send people all the money in the world and they still won’t go out to dinner or book a flight, especially if those services are suspended by government fiat. To the economy, a pandemic is like a blizzard. If you send people a lot of money when the snow is falling, you do not get activity in the snowdrifts, but you will get inflation once the snow has cleared. nbsp; /p  p Third, unlike in previous crises, the government created money and sent checks directly to businesses and households, rather than borrowing, spending, and waiting for the effect to spread to incomes. nbsp; /p  p Will inflation continue? Fundamentally, inflation breaks out when people do not think the government will repay all its debts by eventually running fiscal surpluses. People then try to get rid of the debt and buy things instead, which drives up prices and lowers the real value of debt to what people believe the government will repay. Given that prices have risen 6%, people evidently believe that of the 30% debt expansion, the government will not repay at least 6%. If people believe that less of the debt expansion will be repaid, then the price level will continue to rise, as much as 30%. But inflation will eventually stop: A one-time fiscal helicopter drop leads to a one-time rise in the price level. nbsp; /p  p So, whether inflation will continue depends on future fiscal and monetary policy. Fiscal policy is the big question: Now that we have crossed the Rubicon of people believing that a fiscal expansion will not be fully repaid, will people think the same about additional persistent deficits? The danger here is obvious. nbsp; /p  p If fiscal inflation does erupt, containing it will be difficult. If monetary policymakers try to curtail inflation by raising interest rates, they will run into fiscal headwinds as well as a political buzz saw. First, with the debt-to-GDP ratio above 100%, if the Fed raises interest rates five percentage points, interest costs on the debt will rise by $1 trillion – 5% of GDP. Those interest costs must be paid, or inflation will just get worse.

		<text>John Cochrane s blogThis is part of an ongoing series of essays on inflation.  This one is at Project Syndicate. The next post is somewhat longer and more academic with the same themes. The Ghost of Christmas InflationInflation continues to surge. From its inflection point in February 2021 to last month, the US consumer price index has grown 6% – an 8% annualized rate. The underlying cause is no mystery. Starting in March 2020, the US government created about $3 trillion of new bank reserves (an equivalent to cash) and sent checks to people and businesses. The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so and sent even more checks. The total stimulus comes to about 25% of GDP, and to around 30% of the original federal debt. While much of the money went to help people and businesses severely hurt by the pandemic, much of it was also sent regardless of need, intended as stimulus (or “accommodation”) to stoke demand. The goal was to induce people to spend, and that is what they are now doing. Milton Friedman once said that if you want inflation, you can just drop money from helicopters. That is basically what the US government has done. But this US inflation is ultimately fiscal, not monetary. People do not have an excess of money relative to bonds; rather, people have extra savings and extra apparent wealth to spend. Had the government borrowed the entire $5 trillion to write the same checks, we likely would have the same inflation. By contrast, inflation, when all prices and wages rise together, comes from the balance of overall supply and demand. The economy’s capacity to produce goods and services turns out to be lower than expected. Here, the labor shortage – the “Great Resignation” – is a key underlying fact. Employers can’t find people to work because many people remain on the sidelines, not even looking for jobs. The US Federal Reserve was completely surprised by the surge of inflation, and through most of the year insisted it would be “transitory,” and go away on its own. That turned out to be a major institutional failure. Is it not the Fed’s main job to understand the economy’s supply capacity and fill – but not overfill – the cup of demand? One might expect that among the thousands of economists the Fed employs, there is a group working on figuring out ports’ capacity, the effects of microchip shortages, how many people have retired or are not returning to work, and so forth. One would be disappointed. Central banks have sketchy ideas of supply, mostly centered on statistical trends in labor markets. Why did this fiscal stimulus produce inflation when previous stimulus efforts from 2008 to 2020 fizzled? There are several obvious possibilities. First, this stimulus was much bigger. Former US Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers correctly prophesied inflation in March [Update: February] 2021 by simply looking at the immense size of the spending packages, relative to any reasonable estimate of the GDP shortfall. Second, officials misunderstood the COVID recession. GDP and employment did not fall because there was a lack of “demand.” In a pandemic, you can send people all the money in the world and they still won’t go out to dinner or book a flight, especially if those services are suspended by government fiat. To the economy, a pandemic is like a blizzard. If you send people a lot of money when the snow is falling, you do not get activity in the snowdrifts, but you will get inflation once the snow has cleared. Third, unlike in previous crises, the government created money and sent checks directly to businesses and households, rather than borrowing, spending, and waiting for the effect to spread to incomes. Will inflation continue? Fundamentally, inflation breaks out when people do not think the government will repay all its debts by eventually running fiscal surpluses. People then try to get rid of the debt and buy things instead, which drives up prices and lowers the real value of debt to what people believe the government will repay. Given that prices have risen 6%, people evidently believe that of the 30% debt expansion, the government will not repay at least 6%. If people believe that less of the debt expansion will be repaid, then the price level will continue to rise, as much as 30%. But inflation will eventually stop: A one-time fiscal helicopter drop leads to a one-time rise in the price level. So, whether inflation will continue depends on future fiscal and monetary policy. Fiscal policy is the big question: Now that we have crossed the Rubicon of people believing that a fiscal expansion will not be fully repaid, will people think the same about additional persistent deficits? The danger here is obvious. If fiscal inflation does erupt, containing it will be difficult. If monetary policymakers try to curtail inflation by raising interest rates, they will run into fiscal headwinds as well as a political buzz saw. First, with the debt-to-GDP ratio above 100%, if the Fed raises interest rates five percentage points, interest costs on the debt will rise by $1 trillion – 5% of GDP. Those interest costs must be paid, or inflation will just get worse. Similarly, if the European Central Bank raises interest rates, it increases Italy’s debt costs, threatening a new crisis and imperiling the ECB’s vast portfolio of sovereign bonds. Second, once inflation works its way to higher bond yields, stemming inflation requires higher fiscal surpluses to repay bondholders in more valuable dollars. Otherwise, inflation does not fall. Monetary policy alone cannot contain a bout of fiscal inflation. Nor can temporary “austerity,” especially sharply higher marginal tax rates that undercut long-run growth and therefore long-run tax revenues. The only lasting solution is to get the governments’ fiscal house in order. Finally, supply-oriented policy is needed to meet demand without driving up prices, to reduce the need for social spending, and, indirectly, to boost tax revenues without a larger tax base. Given supply constraints from regulations, labor laws, and disincentives created by social programs, potential solutions here should be obvious. *****A somewhat longer piece on the same themes is on its way, with documentation of the numbers and more explanation. The points here are also covered in more detail in the  covid inflation  chapter of Fiscal Theory of the Price Level.  What is your explanation for low interest rates on government securities? If people are not convinced that the government will run surpluses in the future to repay debts, why are they holding the bonds?The Federal Reserve is the catalyst behind the ultra-low rates by monetizing the debt issued by treasuries. A good person to follow on this is @robinbrooksiif on twitter, the fed s holding of gov debt since GFC has skyrocketed while foreign ownership has plummeted. So it s not that  people  are willing to hold negative bearing gov bonds, it s the FED has stepped in at all costs to ensure the debt gets held, pushing down rates in the process.The bond market is predicting a recession Treasury yields price the Fed reaction function - nothing more.I don t think it is entirely relevant whether fiscal policy or monetary policy is the more powerful driver. We have received double-barreled stimulus on both fronts.In normal times it is the job of the central bank to do the fine tuning. If fiscal stimulus is excessive, the Fed can be restrictive. But, these are not normal times. But, it does feel like the central bankers are asleep.Given the number of times I have tried to buy something in the last 18 months and found that it is simply not available anywhere at any price, I am surprised we have not seen more inflation already. If people believe that less of the debt expansion will be repaid, then the price level will continue to rise, as much as 30%.  As much as 30% if you think there won t be other X-trillion-dollar packages... These deficits might be changing peoples  perception of future deficits too.I m afraid what you are doing over there in the US will soon arrive around here  Had the government borrowed the entire $5 trillion to write the same checks, we likely would have the same inflation. As MIT  84, this troubles me. It s the new theory, I know. And it isn t willingness to hold money vs. bonds that s driving things. But is it maybe debt that will be repaid vs. debt that will not? The Chinese aren t buying debt now. Nor are Americans. Just the Fed, the buyer of last resort. This is a deep comment, which I ve been thinking about for a while. The next essays will have more of this. If reserves are debt people do not think will be repaid and treasury debt is debt people think will be repaid, that makes a big difference. This comment has been removed by the author.Do you have any falsifiable inflation predictions? Are we in for a 30% price level increase? More? Less?Personally, I ve been more convinced so far by the tilt toward goods from services explaining a great deal of the inflation we ve seen. As such, I suppose I d be on team transitory with a baseline expectation that inflation will normalize to the acceptable sub 4% range over the next year. What are your expectations?Fundamentally, inflation breaks out when people do not think the government will repay all its debts by eventually running fiscal surpluses.--John CochraneI dunno. Suppose I sell hot dogs from stand, $1 each. Things are in balance, I sell out by the end of the day, and my cart holds only 100 hot dogs. Then, demand starts to creep up. I start to sell out before the end of the day. So, I take advantage and raise prices, and get back into balance.Vice-versa, if I can afford to accept a lower price. When do I ponder Federal Reserve policy or government deficits? Don t I set prices daily based on demand? Also, if the Fed buys up a large amount of Treasuries...then are people assured the federal government can meet debt payments? After all, the interest payments on the Fed-owned Treasuries flow back into the Treasury. Japan? But why did demand for your hot dogs go up? Maybe people want fewer hamburgers? OK, but then the price of hamburgers goes down. How can people possibly spend more money on everything, to drive up the price of everything? Only if people are trying to get rid of money, and government debt in general. Aggregate demand is not demand, inflation is not a relative price change. Both Hot Dogs and Hamburgers “originate” with the same livestock,, more or less.Reasonable to assume that the Hamburger Guys are low on supply too, and, of course raising prices…My fear, being realized more and more every day, is that ~10% inflation is already baked-in across the board.This comment has been removed by the author.The price of everything can be driven up if the supply of everything is driven down. Imagine an isolated economy where some natural disaster destroys 10% of all business facilities of every kind: supply would go down and prices would go up. In this case facilities weren t destroyed: but lockdowns, reduced production and widespread supply chain disruptions and the price of widely used commodities like oil rose and widely drove up the price of other things. Fiscal stimulus led some people to have more funds to spend to allow prices in general to rise rather than merely leading some prices to fall while others rose.The blog post said:  If people wanted more TVs and fewer restaurant meals, the price of TVs would go up and the price of restaurant meals would go down. Except its more complicated than that: since covid led to people staying home more and buying goods for home use (I hadn t checked on whether TVs were included) and fewer meals out. However: even if competition would normally tend then to drive down restaurant meal prices, other factors like cost to comply with covid restrictions, reduced occupancy allowed, and worker shortages or workers demanding essentially a hazard pay premium for such jobs worked against that and applied to all the industry participants.The pandemic decimated small businesses: oddly I hadn t seen good data on that since relief programs did temporarily keep some afloat and there are supposedly a rise in some new businesses but I hadn t checked data (many I suspect are just individuals who went freelance when unemployed, either to actually get income or to collect the new unemployment for freelancers). Decimating small businesses led to less competition for some niches and more ability temporarily for oligopolies to increase prices in some niches or resist decreases in others. Oddly people talk about the high profits in some public companies: but thats a misleading picture since smaller companies are a different story. It is true that some large companies benefited from the decimation of smaller ones, and of course some profited from the pandemic increasing demand for some things. However also: companies with hope for the future often reinvest revenue into expansion rather than taking a profit. Sometimes profit taking means they are  saving for a rainy day  rather than investing in expansion or fixing supply chain issues, etc. Small companies are likely doing the same. The production capacity needs to shift to deal with the shift in demand to restrain price increases: and that requires capital being spent, often borrowed capital.Yet last I checked (AIER had a post about it) bank lending hasn t recovered, or last I checked investment is still not up to where it should be even though the shift in demand and the decimated businesses should require capital to rebuild and fix the supply chain mess. Again by analogy: picture it like a natural disaster physically destroyed 10% of business facilities and they needed to be rebuilt: capital would be needed. Of course instead: the government wants to take resources and focus on its programs rather than letting the private sector rebuild itself. Risk averse investors from overseas will turn to treasuries and keep those interest rates low, while not enough capital flows in to where its needed to rebuild which is more risky with an unpredictable pandemic going on and the economic situation uncertain. Investors that do take risks tend to be partly distracted with the  everything bubbles , stock prices detached from fundamentals, crypto, etc. Given supply constraints from regulations, labor laws, and disincentives created by social programs, potential solutions here should be obvious. I m no Marxist, but I do believe in equitable compensation and treatment of labor.So, I m curious: which ones do we get rid of?My old classes in Labor History point to a reality that when firms and labor play nice, there are productivity gains to be earned and shared, for it reduces churn, helps morale, and builds trust.Is it really a one time helicopter drop if the government is running primary deficits financed by the FED? Its not as if the US has been comitted to 0 debt growth this whole time and the share of the debt being paid by borrowed funds appears to be shrinking. Excellent analysis as usual. Would be helpful if the writer were to address the failure of TIPS and longs bonds to price this in. This comment has been removed by the author. If fiscal inflation does erupt, containing it will be difficult . . . with the debt-to-GDP ratio above 100% Agreed! Since 1800, 51 out of 52 countries with gross government debt greater than 130% have defaulted, either through restructuring, devaluation, high inflation or outright default. The US crossed that threshold in 2020 and thus seems highly likely to default through sustained high inflation.See pages 3 and 6 of this letter: https://tinyurl.com/bdftm3xnConsider a more intricate alternative theory. Covid shocks induce a switch of demand from services to goods. The price of goods rises, but the price of services may not decline as easily as suggested. A goods producer facing slack demand will see inventories build up and need to reduce prices to get rid of excess inventory. But a service producer facing slack demand does not see a corresponding inventory build up. An Uber driver who finds no passengers does not find the next day that his ride inventory has built up. Disney and American Airlines do not accumulate an inventory of unsold tickets. Further, the main cost of most services is labor, and as noted by Dr. Cochrane, labor is becoming more expensive and difficult to find due to government policy. If price is near marginal cost, service providers may even increase prices to compensate for higher labor costs and make due with far lower demand. Growth in money supply is not required, but the theory predicts we see inflation in the goods sector, lower real GDP in the services sector, overall nominal GDP is unchanged, overall real GDP is lower, and higher overall inflation. I find this to be a compelling argument. Would be interested to hear the author s rebuttal.Downwardly sticky prices in service industries. Possible, but it means those prices decline eventually, and inflation does not just go away, inflation reverses and we get back to the old price level. That does not seem to be in the cards. BTW, I get 1000 words and used 998, so I can t treat every possible complication. Sorry, but I think the logic here is flawed.  But a service producer facing slack demand does not see a corresponding inventory build up. Actually service providers will find their are  building up  time sitting idle. A consultant will find less billable hours, an uber driver sitting in the car idle, etc. Prices may or may not be sticky, but the reason they are or are not is independent of whether it s a physical good or a service. Uber driver who finds no passengers does not find the next day that his ride inventory has built up. Disney and American Airlines do not accumulate an inventory of unsold tickets. Again, this might be an argument for how a supply chain is affected (bull whip effect, etc.) but the behavioral/economic implication is no different. The marginal cost of additional hours or the same seat on a flight remaining empty day after day increases with time.IMHO, good economic modelling recognizes that individuals only value services, not goods themselves (they value the services derived from the physical goods), and we should think in terms of marginal benefits and marginal costs. There s no fundamental economic analysis difference between the service industry and the goods industry. Once you recognize the  goods  themselves are fundamentally again just inputs to a technology providing the services individuals are actually deriving utility from then it s exactly the same in every regard. The empty seat on a place is the good unsold and so is the hamburger cooked but not sold. Both are inputs to a final service, unsold. The burger has a higher depreciation rate of course (and other  goods  might have lower depreciation rates), but otherwise the same.Travel services clearly saw downward price adjustments in the face of less demand. I don t think inventory levels is the driver of firm behavior - I think demand is.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I m also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense. I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have the honesty and courage to use your real name.</text>

		<title>South Asian and Modern Queer Aesthetics Merge in Visually Sumptuous Art</title>

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents LOS ANGELES — For many artists from communities of color, a creative practice isn’t just about making art; it’s also about larger actions, like speaking up against social injustices and fostering the next generation of artists of color. Brooklyn-based artist Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey, Flower-Headed Children, speaks to this intersectionality, challenging visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement. The artist founded the South Asian Women’s Creative Coalition (SAWCC), a nonprofit organization focusing on “advancement, visibility, and development of emerging and established South Asian womxn artists,” according to its official website. She also previously worked as the director of public events and projects at the Queens Museum of Art, among other contributions to the art world. While some of the pieces in the exhibition are deeply intimate, others capture a collective energy. Jasmine Blooms at Night (2021), an installation composed of multiple portraits, pays homage to South Asian feminist activists throughout the country, including Dr. Anjali Arondekar, who wrote the book For the Record: On Sexuality and the Colonial Archive in India, and queer Sri Lankan performance artist, activist, organizer, and educator YaliniDream. Abichandani highlights the rise of South Asian women in United States politics, in particular Vice President Kamala Harris and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. “Kamala’s Inheritance” reflects the artist’s perspective on Harris as a hopeful figure — a South Asian and Black woman in politics, whose presence will potentially usher in even more women of color — but also someone with “hubris, which can push her toward positions that have more flash than substance,” according to the artwork’s walls text. The symbols in the piece reference Greek mythology, Hindu religion (specifically the lotus flower), and American imperialism.“Mona,” a portrait of Mona Eltahawy, likens the journalist to the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet. Eltahawy’s bright red hair fits the overall opulence of the work, comprised of paint, plastic, mirrored glass, and fabric. The portrait expresses her uncompromising personality as she holds up two middle fingers.Other works reference the #MeToo moment, protest, and community action, spotlighting Abichandani’s 2017 performance at the Met Breuer in which she asked 30 people to join her for a #MeToo demonstration. The action took place during photographer Raghubir Singh’s retrospective; Abichandani alleged that Singh assaulted her, and openly shared her story. The exhibition’s text, printed on a bright gold wall, explains that Abichandani’s works “broaden American art audiences’ appreciation of aesthetics that represent an unfamiliar cultural experience.” The show embraces visual sumptuousness; some pieces glitter from every angle.“Unlike other immigrant communities, South Asians have yet to establish institutions for contemporary art and culture,” the show’s curator, Anuradha Vikram, wrote in an ArtNews article in 2019. “Our institutions tend to be houses of worship, folkloric programs, and schools for the classical arts.” Overall, Vikram explains, “attention devoted to contemporary art by South Asians working in the US is rare.” The show asks viewers to check their assumptions, and question their reactions to each piece. Abichandani argues that South Asian devotional art and queer culture have both been regarded as strange and other within (mostly straight, White) Euro-American society. She embraces and exalts queer culture in the show. “Two Boys in Saris” (2018) is installed on its own pedestal, painted gold to match the surrounding walls. It showcases the artist’s integration of devotional images with modern queer aesthetics; the jewelry and clothing on each figure nod to Hindu traditions of dressing idols in temples, while elements like bright blue lipstick speak to liberation in fashion. It portrays two queer Muslim performance artists whose poses point to Bollywood themes.    The show is a reminder that South Asian contemporary artists are ready to be heard, whether or not institutions want to catch up. Jaishri Abichandani: Flower-Headed Children continues at Craft Contemporary (5814 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California) through May 8. The exhibition is curated by Anuradha Vikram.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents MINNEAPOLIS — One of the spookiest objects in Supernatural America: The Paranormal in American Art at the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia) is a wearable reliquary, “Memorial for S.C. Washington” (c. 1789). It contains hair from a dead teenager, along with an image of her spirit breaking free from a tomb. The object exemplifies the ways that the exhibition — which includes over 150 works from the 18th century to the present, by artists who span all different backgrounds and cultures —elucidates dialogues between past and present, and between this world and realms beyond.The exhibition avoids trivializing artists’ beliefs. One painting, “Precipitated Portraits of Lizzie, Mary and Christina Daugherty with Dr. Daugherty” (c. 1900), created as part of a seance with medium sisters Mary E. (May) and Elizabeth Snow (Lizzie) Bangs, credits “spirits” along with the Bangs sisters. The painting seems to be haunted. Similarly, ghostly double-exposed photographs by spirit photographer William H. Mumler likely catch the viewer’s breath as they did 150 years ago, when Spiritualism, the religious movement that posited the possibility of communication with souls of the dead, was in full swing. These are all part of the exhibition’s first section, which contemplates the United States as a haunted place, encompassing US history and land, and the institution of slavery as foundational to this country. Two visceral abstract heads by Jack Whitten, “Head 1” and “Form (3rd Set) 1” (both 1965), swirl in a fog. The artist believed they carried the spirit of Henry Wells, a freedman lynched in 1878. Painted in the Civil Rights era, they act as spiritual testament to protests against racist violence currently being waged around the country.In her magnetic charcoal and chalk drawing “Acheron” (2016), named for the Greek god of the underworld’s river, Alison Saar depicts the African and diaspora archetype, and mythological water spirit, “Mami Wata” (Mother Water) standing up to her waist in water. In the river’s reflection, the basket she carries on her head appears to contain ghoulish skulls. Saar invokes spirits to speak to centuries of violence committed against people of color, while looking to the mythological spirit as a guide to healing and liberation.The second section includes surrealist artists like Dorothea Tanning, whose twisted images of mystical beings in her painting “Guardian Angels” (1946) emanate a mysterious energy. Gertrude Abercrombie’s gothic shadow play in “Strange Shadows (Shadow and Substance)” (1950) is delightfully eerie, while Benjamin West’s 1777 painting, “Saul and the Witch of Endor,” is one of the few Biblical works in the exhibition. Another section focuses on mediumship and contains items like Ouija boards and spirit catchers, while the last section ponders UFOs and dimensions beyond our universe, often based on artists’ personal experiences. Chris Pappan, who is Osage, Kaw, and Cheyenne River Lakota Sioux, turns to UFOs to address the politics of colonialism and white supremacy. Pappan reframes colonialism as an alien attack in “Another Incident at the Big Chief” (2021) and “See Haw Directs an Alien Invasion from the West” (1996). The works, rendered on municipal documents from the 1920s, draw from the Native American ledger art tradition, which often illustrated historical events; Pappan’s work offers a kind of alternative history through the alien metaphor. Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power. They reveal the ghosts that linger in our collective psyche. In a time when we are still grappling with the unimaginable losses of COVID-19 and racial reckonings that ignited in 2020, the exhibition asks us to acknowledge, if not necessarily make peace with, our country’s haunted spirit. Supernatural America: The Paranormal in American Art continues at the Minneapolis Institute of Art (2400 Third Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota) through May 15. The exhibition was curated by Robert Cozzolino, Patrick and Aimee Butler Curator of Paintings at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents SANTA FE, NM — In the fashion world, it’s “taboo” for a designer to share details about a collection that has yet to hit the runway. So when I spoke with fashion designer Patricia Michaels, or Water Lily (Taos Pueblo), she spoke carefully but excitedly about her design company PM Waterlily’s collection for this year’s SWAIA’s Santa Fe Indian Market fashion show. Since 1922, the Santa Fe Indian Market has been the premiere venue for artists coming from tribal nations throughout the United States to show and sell their work. Historically founded to combat the erasure of Indigenous peoples and their cultures, the event transforms the Santa Fe plaza for one weekend in August in celebration and support of Native artists.Water Lily, who has maintained a presence at Indian Market since birth, says, “I feel like the team that I’m building and the team that I’ll continue to work with is right on board with me. They’re excited … my couture looks that will be on the runway will be exciting, but so will the ready-to-wear.”An alumna of the Institute of American Indian Arts and The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Water Lily’s training also includes apprenticeships with the Santa Fe Opera’s costume designer and a tailor in Milan, Italy. In 2014, she received the prestigious Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian Arts and Design Award. And although Water Lily had been designing for nearly three decades prior, including gaining national recognition for her work in the 2015 Peabody Essex Museum show Native Fashion Now, she found mainstream recognition as runner-up of Project Runway during Season 11. This pop culture appearance brought the designer’s Native-inspired haute couture fashion to New York and audiences around the world — a historical first.PM Waterlily’s original and innovative designs for the Santa Fe Indian Market centennial incorporate her handmade signature detailing such as dying, painting, felting, and beading that reference — and sometimes reframe — the Southwestern landscape and textiles of Northern New Mexico’s Native Pueblo cultures. Her previous collections have featured wools from local Taos farms, sheer fabrics with gestural brushstrokes, black geometric patterns inspired by Anasazi pottery, bright red and rich fuschia of mountain berries and desert blooms, and metallic detailing informed by the micaceous pottery of the region. Glimpses of her designs can be seen on her TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook accounts and at Malouf on the Plaza in Santa Fe.“It definitely is exciting … The honor of being able to be at Indian Market — it’s such an important centennial [and] time in history that I feel a responsibility to heighten my expression,” she says.Currently working outside of Santa Fe, Water Lily joked about the chaos happening in her studio as she juggles the collection for Indian Market and alongside her other projects. For example, she’s been creating costumes for performances by Opera Lafayette (Washington, DC) of André Gréry’s Silvain, which tells a story of farmers in the 1860s in the territory of what today is northern New Mexico. She took on the project in part to incorporate a part of New Mexico culture she has been eager to explore through fashion. Informing her designs for the opera is the art of Spanish colonial New Mexico, ranging from carved and painted woodworking of santero artists (makers of religious imagery) to wool and cotton techniques of colcha embroidery, offering a contemporary interpretation of life and fashion during the state’s territorial period.When I asked her specifically about this year’s centennial Indian Market, she became overwhelmed by what the milestone means for her and for the numerous artists and families that have participated in the market for decades. Thinking about the number of artworks that Indigenous artists have made over 100 years, she says, “When you go into Indian Market, just remember that there are prayers in every single piece of art on the plaza.” Adding to this, the artworks at Indian Market are testaments to cultural survival and community resilience, which she and her family carry on with their work.  While reflecting on her inspirations, Water Lily was candid about the early pushback she received at Indian Market. “When I first wanted to do a fashion show and [market organizers] wouldn’t let me because, they said I was taking away from tradition, and I had my booth protested … I [remained] headstrong about doing a contemporary fashion show.”Despite the resistance to include a fashion show in 1992, she continued to advocate for the opportunity to debut her designs the way they were intended to be shown: on a catwalk. As a fashion designer who is Indigenous, Water Lily refused to conform to rigid demands designated by “traditional” and “authentic” Native American art — labels that were invented and implemented by non-Native organizers. Instead, she, like many Native artists, celebrates her culture through dialogues with the past combined with innovation grounded in the world today and in the future. Thirty years later, Indian Market would seem incomplete without the annual fashion show that she adamantly pushed for, and that will hopefully continue for the next 100 years.  In anticipation of this year’s market, Water Lily mentions that she and her team are celebrating the people they have worked with over the years. The designer says, “The honor is beyond words of the people who came before me to allow me this space.” Mindful of the Native women that preceded her, she explains, “I have a lot of admiration for women of the past. They were really able to stand their ground in a world that was changing.” And, in the face of such change, “Our cultures were being policed so that we wouldn’t speak the language, we wouldn’t participate in ceremonies,” which then led her to the bigger picture of her creative endeavors. “To me, that’s part of my inspiration. [The fact that] I can still go home and still be in ceremonies and still bring something contemporary to the market so that I’m not selling my tradition, but I’m making enough so that my tradition still exists.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>The Never-Ending Storytelling of Native American Jewelry and Its Makers</title>

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents SANTA FE, NM — Each summer, on the weekend following the third Thursday in August, the population of the small city of Santa Fe, New Mexico more than doubles as over 150,000 visitors from around the world converge on the largest juried Native American art event in the world: Santa Fe Indian Market. Now organized by the Southwest Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA), Indian Market was first held in 1922, and as the event prepares to celebrate its centennial anniversary, it has grown to include over 1,200 Indigenous artists from across the United States and Canada. Indian Market, and the many concurrent satellite events which include performances, exhibitions, lectures, screenings, and more, features artists working across an extraordinary variety of media.Although this year’s participating artists are yet to be announced, one thread is continuous: Storytelling is central in much of Native American art, and the work being produced by Indigenous jewelers is no exception. Native jewelry, whether based in historical practice, contemporary innovation, or somewhere in between, carries the identities and histories of the artists and craftspeople who created it; jewelry allows us to carry those stories with us and on us. The work of Alaskan Native Denise Wallace (Chugach Sugpiaq/Alutiiq), a longtime staple of Indian Market, exemplifies these facts. Winner of the Best of Show award for Jewelry at the 2021 Market, stories and histories are at the heart of Wallace’s work.But her winning piece from 2021 Indian Market, Origins, Roots, and Sources, is an impeccable example of her work. The belt, like many of her best-known pieces, utilizes precious metals, custom stonework, scrimshaw, intricate mechanisms, and hidden transformative elements to create works that speak with her unique voice. Featuring masks and figures that, according to Wallace, “are based in the history of our country,” she incorporates traditional stories with references to history, environmental fears, and current politics. The work also contains specific allusions to missing and murdered indigenous women, to two-spirit people, and civil rights leaders Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (the figure representing Ginsburg references the following quote from the late Supreme Court Justice, “I ask no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.”) Wallace’s work here honors the labor and sacrifices of those who came before us, while recognizing that a great deal of work still lies ahead.“I don’t really think of myself as a jeweler,” says Wallace. “I see myself as a storyteller. I’m not just making adornment. There’s history, personal energy, there’s my story.” Speaking of art more broadly she says, “It’s all about storytelling. We’re continuing our histories and stories. We build on the craft of the people who come before us, and the people who come after will build on top of what we make.”Indigenous adornment practices aren’t limited to jewelry made in precious metal and stones. Indigenous artworks that adorn the body include textiles, beadwork, quillwork, found objects, and more. Hollis Chitto (Choctaw, Laguna and Isleta Pueblos) is an artist who practices traditional beadwork, but the body and its ability to serve as a vessel for histories and identity are central ideas that inform this work. Hailing from Santa Fe, Hollis grew up in an environment surrounded by art. He had his first experience showing work at Indian Market at five years old with his father (esteemed Mississippi Choctaw sculptor and ceramics artist Randy Chitto) and began learning beading at the age of ten. Chitto’s bag “In Honor of Pukni” references his personal connection to beadwork through his family. “I made this bag in honor of my grandmother. My father’s mother helped provide for her family in Chicago by selling her beadwork,” he explains. The bag features Southeast style abstract floral designs, as well as appliqué in silk ribbon that mimics the diamond pattern found on the backs of rattlesnakes. “Although I never had the privilege of learning the art form from her, I believe everything I make is an extension of her love for her family,” he continues. “When I asked my dad if pukni would be proud of my work, he said, ‘She would be blown away, but ask why are you using such small beads?’ ”Chitto, who identifies as two-spirit, says of adornment, “What we put on our bodies is a statement. It signals identity, culture, gender, socio-economic status and more. What a person wears tells the story of who that person is. It shows who you are to the world and as Indigenous people our identities are wrapped up in storytelling.” His bag “Bloodwork No. 2” exemplifies the connection between Indigenous bodies and the stories they carry. This bag features a colorful example of floral beadwork interrupted by a cascade of red evocative of flowing blood, a weighty symbol for Native and LGBTQ2+ people alike.“The blood in our veins is what gives us life. Its importance is celebrated in various tribes as a fact. Unfortunately, it is this same substance that is at risk for a sickness that is taking a portion of our people,” Chitto says of this work.“The taboos of speaking openly about unsafe sex and high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use have only served to add to new infection rates due to ignorance. My goal for this piece is to act as a starting point of discussion about this topic. The blood down the center is the elephant in the room; we all have it, so few of us give it a second thought unless we need to.”Speaking on the topic of non-Natives wearing Indigenous adornment, Chitto says, “A lot of bead workers get the question from non-native — ‘Is it okay to wear this?’ The question is coming from a good place … So long as the work is purchased from a Native artist, and so long as you are engaging with the culture respectfully, then you’re good. That interaction and engagement becomes a part of your story.” Denise Wallace echoes this sentiment, “It’s pretty obvious when people are appropriating culture in a disrespectful way, but when a person buys and wears a piece of jewelry, they are supporting that artist’s community and promoting the culture.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions. He cannot understand why this woman has committed such brutal crimes against men. He says it’s “like a work of fiction” while the other detective on the case says, “No one can understand why she did what she did.” But I disagree.The reasons for this killing spree that these men can’t account for are clear to me given America’s history of male violence. In the 2003 film Monster, we see Charlize Theron enter into a trauma response every time she gets into a car with a man: She is paranoid and on guard. From what is insinuated of Wuornos’s long history of experiences of abuse by men, this response is to be expected. A triggered woman is not a mystery. Monster succeeds where this docuseries from the perspective of the investigators fails, because it comprehends the pain and abuse that made Wuornos into someone the Catching Killers detectives can’t wrap their heads around.In contrast, the cishet male murderer holds a coveted spot in the cultural imagination. He is typically depicted as worldly wise, having great taste in music and art, for example Hannibal Lecter — as played by Anthony Hopkins or Joe Goldberg as played by Penn Badgley on the televised series You. These male murderers have instincts to violence that they cannot resist. They are presented as an inevitable evil; they cannot change their predatory nature.When I think of Wuornos, I think also of Elisabetta Sirani’s painting “Timoclea Killing Her Rapist”(1659). Timoclea forcing her attacker down the well is a striking image. His legs are spread apart, mimicking a pose perhaps similar to one he may have forced her into when he assaulted her. With this swift movement, Timoclea shifts the power dynamic. Male violence makes way for the revenge of the oppressed woman. Wuornos may not have chosen the right men for the well, but her anger can definitely be understood.We have too many depictions of male murders, men who kill because they have a compulsive tendency to violence. I want to see more women whose rage knows no bounds, who refuse to turn their hatred into self-destruction. We need to see the cultural history of female violence as a history of retaliation, a fuck-you to the patriarchal violence women consistently experience. We need a space for our anger. Women’s rage deserves to be unpacked and understood as more than bunny boiler hysterics because like Serani’s Timoclea, a woman killing her rapist flips the patriarchal hierarchy, upending the male violence that still dominates perspectives on women in our visual culture.  Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>From Ancient Egypt to Teotihuacán, Centuries-Old Palettes Illuminate the Role of the Painter</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 444  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/image-1.jpeg?fit=720%2C444 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents For all the paint fragments found throughout the ancient world, on murals, pottery, sculpture, and scrolls, surprisingly few ancient paint palettes have been uncovered. Ancient palettes in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the British Museum in London, and the Louvre in Paris — among other institutions — number in the single digits. This is even more surprising now that scholars know ancient Greek and Roman statues were vibrantly painted. The palettes we do have, many of which still contain traces of original pigment, show us how people painted, but they also tell us about the role of the painter in ancient civilizations.Most of the existing paint boxes and palettes are Ancient Egyptian: They belonged to scribes, tomb painters, and recreational painters of the upper classes. Some include the original brushes — for scribes, pen-like lengths of rush grass, and for professional and recreational illustrators, thicker bundles of grass to compose larger images.Scribes’ palettes mostly held only red and black pigments and many bear inscriptions of the king’s name, suggesting the importance of the scribe in the eyes of the ruler. Inscriptions with the king’s name — as in a palette at the British Museum featuring hieroglyphs in high relief that read “the perfect god, lord of the Two Lands, Nebpehtire, s[on of Ra, Ahmose]” — may have noted that the owner was the king’s official scribe and suggest that perhaps the king himself gave the palette to the scribe.An Ancient Egyptian painting palette owned by a professional painter and housed at the Met also bears the king’s name, but one at the Cleveland Museum of Art includes the name of the owner himself, signifying it was likely used for leisurely painting. Unlike scribes’ bicolor palettes, recreational and tomb painters used a wider range of colors, all naturally occurring besides so-called “Egyptian blue.” Replacing the expensive lapis lazuli, Egyptian blue was a synthetic compound made by heating malachite, sand, and other materials to a temperature of 1,500-2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The method was adopted by the Ancient Romans, but by the Middle Ages, the process was lost, and painters relied once again on the prohibitively expensive lapis lazuli.In Ancient Egypt, blue was used to paint the gods (red, yellow, black, and green all came from the ground, making them unfit to depict deities). This concept is seen again in Christian art centuries later, with Mary and Jesus repeatedly depicted in blue. Across the world and made centuries after the Egyptian palettes, another ancient paint set links the painter to the divine. A group of pigment jars from Teotihuacán, near current-day Mexico City, are arranged in the “quincunx,” an important religious and astrological symbol found throughout ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. In the quincunx, four objects surround a higher central object, which symbolizes the center of the universe. The symbol has been found throughout Teotihuacán in arrangements of dots used to calculate time. Scholars have argued that four-sided pyramids, like the central Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacán, reflect the quincunx because the four sets of stairs lead to a higher, sacred site. The Teotihuacán culture had no writing system, relying instead on images painted on pottery and murals which used relationships and metaphors to relay meaning. In an essay accompanying the Met’s set of painting jars, the author argues that mixing the colors was seen as a haphazard moral shortcoming, one that would be in contradiction to the jars’ divine quincunx shape.Inscriptions and meaning in paint sets from Ancient Egypt and Teotihuacán define them as culturally significant objects and show that their owners too were culturally significant. But despite the clear historical, religious, and political importance of painting and record keeping — and all of the ancient painted objects in our museums — it’s rare to see an actual paint set.  In an interview with the Atlantic, author of Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color Philip Ball discussed how the study of paint itself is largely outside the realm of traditional art history and criticism. “It seems to be largely restricted to conservators at museums who, of necessity, have to know something about the material aspects of the works as well as the art-historical context,” Ball said. “By not understanding these craft aspects of making art, we run the risk of imagining that art is just about having the idea rather than about actually having to go about creating it,” Ball continued. “I do think this is a perspective that has been underplayed in conventional art history and art criticism, and that it could be brought closer to the fore.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Antiquities Expert Calls on Getty Museum to Repatriate Ancient Artwork</title>

Hecht Jr., who was accused of trafficking in looted art.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Over the past two decades, Dr. Christos Tsirogiannis has identified upwards of 1,500 looted antiquities by scouring museum holdings and auction house offerings, and matching up objects of dubious provenance with photos taken from the archives of disgraced dealers. Now, the Denmark-based professor, former field archaeologist, vigilante provenance researcher, and repatriation advocate — whom convicted antiquities trafficker Giacomo Medici characterized as “doing terrorism toward the auction houses and the museums” — is calling upon the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles to repatriate an ancient Roman fresco fragment. The 23-by-17 inch painting scrap, he says, is linked to American art antiquities dealer Robert E. Hecht Jr., who was accused of trafficking in looted art.For six decades, Hecht sold Mediterranean antiquities to leading museums and prominent private collectors. He regularly supplied the Getty Museum with artifacts in the 1980s and 1990s and allegedly participated in a tax fraud scheme that involved private collectors donating trafficked antiquities to the Getty. After a raid of Medici’s warehouse of unprovenanced artifacts in 1995, Italy began to investigate Hecht for his part in an international antiquities trafficking operation; Hecht had, for example, acquired a looted Etruscan vase from Medici, which he sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. (It was repatriated in 2006.) Shortly after Medici was convicted in 2004, Hecht was indicted, along with Getty Museum antiquities curator Marion True. For Hecht and True, the multi-year trial ended without a conviction when the statute of limitations on the charges expired. Hecht died shortly after the case ended in 2012.When French and Italian officials raided Hecht’s apartment in 2001, they found his personal memoir along with “letters, antiquities covered with soil and wrapped in plastic shopping bags, as well as Polaroid and regular-print images depicting restored and unrestored antiquities, some still ‘very dirty with earth,’” Tsirogiannis wrote in his article “Nekyia: ‘Woman on a balcony’ at the Jean Paul Getty Museum,” published in the Journal of Art Crime in December 2019. The researcher — who has traced numerous artifacts to Hecht, including a helmet currently on offer at Christie’s — describes a bundle of photographs, connected to one another with string, depicting antiquities ranging from vases to figurines to mosaics. A fresco fragment currently on view at the Getty Villa was among the antiquities in the photos, he says. “Woman on a Balcony” is believed to be part of a large Roman Second Style wall painting, which perhaps decorated a dining room. It was painted in Italy — Tsirogiannis suspects that it was made in Pompeii — sometime between 10 BCE and 14 CE. In the image, a woman in a loose tunic and matching cap drinks from a cup as she balances a pitcher against a balcony railing. The fragment belonged to antiquities collectors Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman, who first exhibited the work publicly with the Getty in 1994 and donated it to the museum — along with 287 other objects — in 1996. The Getty also purchased 33 artifacts from the Fleischman collection.Tsirogiannis explains in his article that the Getty recently updated the online provenance for the object and revealed that the Fleischmans acquired the fragment from Fritz Bürki, who regularly acted as a criminal front for Hecht, according to Tsirogiannis, who cites Peter Watson and Cecilia Todeschini’s 2007 book The Medici Conspiracy. In 2007, two years after the museum’s antiquities curator was indicted for trafficking, the Getty repatriated 40 objects to Italy. One of the objects in the return was a second fresco fragment — a Pomepiian lunette depicting Hercules — that the Fleischmans had also acquired from Bürki, making “Woman on a Balcony” even more suspect.Tsirogiannis brought his findings to the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, which has a task force that is dedicated to fighting antiquities trafficking.“The next steps regarding the repatriation of the fresco to Italy, belong exclusively to the Manhattan DA’s Office, after I sent them, last January, my academic article … which includes all the relevant evidence and information,” Tsirogiannis told Hyperallergic.“It is important that the fresco be returned because it belongs to Italy and because there will be a chance to be re-contextualized,” Tsirogiannis continued. “Sooner or later it will help the Italian archaeological service to locate the exact monument and the exact part of a wall at this monument from where originally the fresco was cut off.”Lord Colin Renfrew, a leading archeologist at the University of Cambridge, questioned the legitimacy of the fragment’s provenance in 2000 and has recently echoed calls for the fragment’s return. “One can presume it to be looted when it really has no respectable provenance,” Renfrew told the Observer. “You need a provenance going back to the beginning of the century to be of any value.”When Hyperallergic reached out to the museum for comment, a spokesperson said: “Getty continually researches the background and provenance of items within its collection and considers new evidence when it is presented. We have a longstanding policy of returning objects to their country of origin or discovery when the research indicates it is warranted.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.If approved, it would be a major hit for the DCLA, which would have its overall budget cut by a third in 2023.“We want livable wages and to be able to live well,” said ​​Rob Kempton, a security guard. “I think our efforts are warranted, and we aren’t going to go down without a fight.”The Getty is exhibiting exquisite anatomical illustrations from the 16th century to the present.

		<title>NYC Mayor Eric Adams Proposes Slashing Culture Funds by $72 Million</title>

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents In early March, New York Mayor Eric Adams released a blueprint for a plan to rebuild the city’s economy after two devastating years of COVID-19. Recognizing that arts and culture are key catalysts for the recovery of the city’s financial health, the plan announced a “Culture at Risk” response team to assist arts and nightlife businesses on the brink of closure and a “one-of-a-kind” cultural district on Governors Island. Just a month earlier, however, the mayor released a preliminary budget for fiscal year 2023 that proposes slashing one-third of the city’s culture budget. So how does the mayor’s grandiose rhetoric about New York’s cultural comeback match up with his budgetary policy? The “Rebuild, Renew, Reinvent” plan blueprint aims to “accelerate” NYC’s economic recovery through investment in the small business, tourism, and arts and culture sectors. With 400,000 jobs lost since the pandemic hit in 2020, the plan states restoring employment in the city to a “pre-pandemic level” as its primary goal. As expected of Mayor Adams, who ran for office on a tough-on-crime platform, one of the prerequisites to “restarting the city’s economic engines” is tackling public safety concerns including gun violence and homelessness. The plan also calls on employees to return to in-person work, another message the mayor has pushed aggressively for months. In a style reminiscent of former President Donald Trump’s administration, the document is interspersed with flattering images of Adams shaking hands with workers and small business owners, posing for the camera holding signed paperwork, and overlooking the city’s skyline from a skyscraper window. New York’s arts sector was among the hardest hit during the pandemic, per a report by the state comptroller from last February. The report found that two-thirds of all arts, entertainment, and recreation jobs in the city vaporized in 2020. An even deeper crisis faces immigrant artists in the city, who report diminished livelihood sources with little to no aid from local authorities. In a survey of 643 community-based New York arts organizations conducted by Americans for the Arts and published by the think tank Center for an Urban Future (CUF) last year, one-quarter of all cultural organizations located in lower-income zip codes across the city reported losing access to their only physical space during the pandemic. “The blueprint comes at an incredibly pivotal time for the arts,” said Eli Dvorkin, CUF’s editorial and policy director, in an interview with Hyperallergic. “We see, for example, that even as performing arts employment has been ticking back up in recent quarters, it’s still down about 36% from 2019.” Dvorkin welcomed the proposals in the blueprint but expressed doubts as to whether they would be backed with sufficient funding. “There are some really positive things in this blueprint but not much of it will be possible without allocating some real funding behind it,” he said.The city’s preliminary $98.5 billion budget for fiscal year 2023, unveiled in mid-February, focuses on slashing spending in favor of a record level of budget reserves. It allocates $145.5 million for the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA), down from $230.1 million in 2022. The $84.6 million cuts, which amount to 36.8% of the DCLA’s 2022 budget, include the loss of $12 million in one-time federal funding last year that was used to support the city’s $25 million WPA-style City Artist Corps program. Still, it’s a major hit for the DCLA, which would receive $72 million less in city funding in the coming fiscal year. Meanwhile, the city’s Correction Department would enjoy a funding increase from about $800 million to $1.2 billion, and the New York Police Department’s budget would remain flat.The DCLA, known as the country’s largest cultural funding agency, gets 99.8% of its financial support from the city. If approved, the 2023 budget would take away almost $57 million from the agency’s grantmaking funds, limiting its ability to continue supporting over 1,200 cultural organizations and thousands of individual artists in its constituency.To further complicate matters, last week, Adams appointed Laurie Cumbo, a former council member with a history of racially insensitive remarks, to head the DCLA. Cumbo notoriously opposed legislation that grants noncitizens in the city the right to vote and has made controversial statements about NYC’s Asian and Jewish communities. Against this backdrop, the recovery plan blueprint commits to “fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive creative sector.” The DCLA has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s request for comment. The city’s most ambitious plan for the arts in the blueprint is a 10-year initiative to build a cultural district on Governors Island, established in repurposed former military homes. The new complex will include exhibition spaces, offices, and will host an artist residency. The city is also poised to launch a “Governors Island Arts” campaign, announcing upcoming art installations, cultural events, and programming starting this summer.The promised “Culture at Risk” response team will help arts organizations facing closure navigate government bureaucracy and secure financing assistance, according to the blueprint. The initiative is modeled on a similar program launched by the London City Hall in 2016 and expanded during the pandemic. In 202o, London City injected £2.3 million (~$3 million) into the program and has since saved hundreds of businesses and nonprofits from closing. The blueprint also promises to reform the work of the DCLA’s Cultural Development Fund (CDF), its major grantmaking program. This includes allowing multi-year funding for all grantees; efforts to diversify the panel review process; ensuring equity in CDF funding criteria; and “exploring the possibility” of allowing funds to be used for general operating expenses. If implemented, these strategies could help small and mid-size arts organizations in the city that have long struggled to gain access to city funding.Mayor Adams’s preliminary budget will have to go through a series of hearings and discussions in the NYC Council before it’s finally adopted in May or June. “Every year, there’s a budget dance, where the mayor’s budget comes lower and city council puts money back in, and there’s usually a dramatic swing from the preliminary budget to the adopted budget at the end of the budget negotiations,” Dvorkin told Hyperallergic. “But this time around, it’s not clear at all that the DCLA would escape some pretty serious cuts.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Guard the Guards, Not Just the Art, Says Baltimore Museum Union in Demonstration</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 540  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Image.jpeg?fit=720%2C540 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure “We want livable wages and to be able to live well,” said ​​Rob Kempton, a security guard. “I think our efforts are warranted, and we aren’t going to go down without a fight.”</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents At 9:30am today, March 22, around a dozen members of the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) Union held a demonstration right off the front steps leading up to the historic entrance of the museum. They held placards that read “Guarding the Guards” — a rewording of the exhibition title Guarding the Art, curated by the museum’s security guards and opening to press at the same time as their action. Other signs said “1 Voice 1 Union,” “Wall-to-Wall Union Election,” and “Sign Our Union Election Agreement Now.”The workers’ goal was to put pressure on museum Director Christopher Bedford to sign the City of Baltimore’s union election agreement, which workers say he received two months ago. Without his signature, workers cannot vote to certify their union — which a petition on BMA Union’s website claims a majority of eligible staff support. The hourlong demonstration was sandwiched into a packed day for the workers. Many of them had just come from a meeting with Bedford and Chief Operating Officer Christine Dietz, and some were headed back to the museum to work on a show curated by many of the same guards who are advocating for unionization. “We were trying to co-opt and piggyback on the media preview day for the Guarding the Art exhibition,” Dereck Mangus, a security guard at the museum, told Hyperallergic. “The union has basically tried to put their money where their mouth is,” he continued. “It’s like, all right — we agree with [the museum’s] progressive vision and we acknowledge projects like Guarding the Art are in good faith, and a small step in the right direction. But we need to extend this to all departments, not just guards — and to have a union.”The meeting this morning followed a more adversarial all-staff email from Bedford sent on March 10, also posted on BMA’s website, that indicated museum leadership was unwilling to conduct an election through the city because it vested too much authority in a third-party arbitrator. In that same email, Bedford also reportedly encouraged workers to consider conducting the union election through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). But that option is categorically unappealing to BAM staff because the NLRB retains a rule they consider antiquated, which would prevent the union from representing both security guards and the rest of the museum’s workers. “The purpose of that email really was to cause confusion around this process,” Kathleen Cancio, a spokesperson for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), told Hyperallergic. “How can you celebrate the security guards, but in the same breath, exclude them by suggesting this process?” Cancio added that BMA workers were “really happy … to get their messages across” this morning, “both in their meeting with Bedford and publicly out in the open.” An email from the union sent to leadership and the board trustees this afternoon, reviewed by Hyperallergic, said that Bedford expressed “support of guards and non-guards being in one unit” during the meeting.The action today was the BMA Union’s first physical demonstration since they first publicized their intention to form a union in September of last year, with the goals of improving job security, wages, accountability, and health and safety protections at the museum. Workers also cited their desire to be included in conversations around reopening during the pandemic and their interest in pushing the BMA to realize its own vision of becoming a more diverse and equitable institution — a promise made under Bedford’s leadership in 2020, when he controversially proposed deaccessioning three major works in the museum’s collection to fund equity initiatives.Within days of launching the campaign, the BMA Union won the support of a majority of museum workers. On October 5, a blog post on AFSCME’s website formally announced the BMA Union’s intention to unionize with AFSCME Council 67, the local Baltimore-based chapter of the largest trade union of public employees in the United States. The workers additionally officially requested a union election through the city of Baltimore in October.Mangus, who has written about museum unions and about his experience curating Guarding the Art for Hyperallergic, added that they “got close to meeting halfway” with museum leadership during the talks today.But there is additional concern that museum leadership will drag their feet over the next few months given that Bedford will be leaving the BMA to assume the helm at the San Francisco Museum of Art (SFMOMA) — a unionized museum — in June. “They drag us along through these processes and stall, just to induce fear or even apathy,” Mangus said. He cited efforts across town at the Walters Art Museum, which have also been stonewalled by similar tactics employed by museum leadership.When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the BMA sent Hyperallergic a link to the March 10 statement, which says that “a city-run election, as was requested by BMA union organizers, is not a viable option.” “The BMA’s board and leadership will respect the outcome of a vote and will continue to work with staff toward greater equity, regardless of that outcome,” the statement says.The opening of Guarding the Art provides a perfect backdrop for workers to distill the essence of their motivation to unionize — capturing in a nutshell both the unique opportunities they have, but also the challenges they continue to face, as staff members at purportedly progressive institutions desperate to prove their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Seventeen members of the BMA’s security team co-curated the show, selecting works that were particularly meaningful to them. They will also participate in talks and Q As in late April to discuss their work on the project.“We are de-privileging people who usually have the power like curators, and privileging people who don’t have that kind of agency and power as guards,” Rob Kempton, a security guard who was also a Guarding the Art curator, told Hyperallergic. “It’s a very kaleidoscopic show. It is diverse in its offering, showcasing different art historical canons and time periods.” Kempton added that he hoped this show would “spark a torch” at other museums. Now that guards are questioning long unquestioned labor hierarchies at museums, obliterating the artificial divide between service and curatorial positions, they are seizing the moment to demand better labor conditions. “We want livable wages and to be able to live well. It’s not that we aren’t, but I find it hard to save — I’m living paycheck to paycheck,” Kempton said. “I think our efforts are warranted, and we aren’t going to go down without a fight.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents The Missoula Art Museum in Missoula, Montana, presents Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience, the artist’s first exhibition in a US museum. Maguire, an internationally renowned artist represented by galleries in New York City, Chicago, Dublin, and Paris, has worked closely with museum staff to put together this survey exhibition.Through painting, Maguire hopes to draw attention to marginalized voices and human rights atrocities on large canvases. “The goal of my work is public outrage,” he said. Over the course of his career, he has spent time in Aleppo, Syria; Bentiu, South Sudan; São Paulo, Brazil; Juárez, Mexico; Tucson, Arizona; and other locations. He visits and listens with families of displaced or missing peoples and works with professionals on the frontlines of these migratory and geopolitical issues, aiming to harness a journalist’s attention to detail and humanity with his artistic talent during his travels.This exhibition unites several recent bodies of work. Maguire’s techniques are striking, with the intention of evoking intense, almost visceral, responses in the viewer. Bombed-out buildings depicted in dripping paint characterize his Aleppo series from 2017. Additional paintings in the show reference immigration and refugee crises, border crossings, and drug wars in Mexico. Maguire tackles these profound issues with strokes of vibrant color. “Brian’s power as an artist is his ability to illuminate stories that otherwise go untold,” said curator Brandon Reintjes.The exhibition includes loans from the Tia Collection in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Fergus McCaffrey Gallery in New York, New York; Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago, Illinois; Kerlin Gallery in Dublin, Ireland; and collectors Christian Groenke and Gulia Bruckmann. Exhibition support comes from Culture Ireland, Fergus McCaffrey Gallery, and the Williams family of Missoula.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is on view at the Missoula Art Museum through August 13, 2022.For more information, visit missoulaartmuseum.org.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Boston University School of Visual Arts is proud to present the 2022 MFA Thesis Exhibitions, featuring the work of graduating MFA candidates in Graphic Design, Painting, and Sculpture. Two showcases will highlight their work in Boston University Art Galleries’s Faye G., Jo, and James Stone Gallery.MFA Thesis Exhibitions kicked off with the MFA Painting and Sculpture showcase, which is open through April 2. The MFA Graphic Design exhibition will be on view April 13–29 with an opening reception at Stone Gallery on April 15 from 5 to 7pm.Lucy Kim, associate professor of art and interim chair of graduate studies in painting and David Snyder, assistant professor of art and chair of graduate studies in sculpture share the following about the students’ work and resilience while navigating the uncertainty a pandemic can bring:This remarkable group of students started their MFA journey in the Fall of 2020, optimistic that the confusion and uncertainty of a global pandemic would soon fade. Although these hopes proved false, these artists persevered in their studios and classes and continued to learn, expand, make, break, scream, cry, laugh, sigh, and wonder what it even means to make art in this moment. After the tumult and uncertainty of the past two years, they realize that they are re-entering a landscape that has fundamentally shifted.As their faculty, it has been an honor to be a part of their journey and privy to their individual stories. The works in this exhibition point to where each artist started nearly two years ago, to a point of arrival today, and to where they may be heading. The strength of their efforts suggests an overwhelming potential that fills us with hope.Learn more about Boston University School of Visual Arts and the 2022 MFA Thesis Exhibitions.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>How Artists Have Explored and Understood the Human Body Through Time</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 980  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/flap-anatomy.jpeg?fit=720%2C980 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure The Getty is exhibiting exquisite anatomical illustrations from the 16th century to the present.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents LOS ANGELES — Leonardo da Vinci once explained how important it was for artists to understand anatomy. Some poorly drawn bodies, he wrote, “seem a sack full of nuts rather than the surface of a human being.” Happily, Flesh and Bones: The Art of Anatomy at the Getty Research Institute has selected the more accurate and exquisite anatomical illustrations from the 16th century onwards. The exhibition revivifies past views of bodies and provokes continued exploration of how we understand our human mechanics.Fittingly, the corporeal show opens with death. “The Living Dead,” the first of six sections, explains how the visual tradition of the skeletal ‘dance of death’ reminded viewers of their mortality. This motif lingered in posed and animated anatomies of the early modern era, like a hunched, prayerful skeleton by Domenico Bonaveri. Other mesmerizing images include a woodcut illustrating nerves snaking away from a skeleton’s bones as if electrified, and a depiction of the uncanny fetal assemblages of Cornelis Huyberts, who arranged infant skeletons around a stony landscape and originally included morbid captions about mortality.The era’s new possibilities in printing and humanism spurred stronger interest in mapping the body, Monique Kornell, curator and author of the accompanying catalogue, explained to Hyperallergic in an interview. This change was embodied in Andreas Vesalius’s seminal 1543 anatomical treatise De Corpus Fabrica Humani Libri Septum, colloquially known as De Fabrica, which included over 200 intricate anatomical woodcuts that differed from classical views of the body.The fascination with depicting the body and how it worked allowed physicians to better understand and heal it. A section on “Anatomy for Artists” explains how anatomy classes and dissections were incorporated into Renaissance artistic education. Partnerships between anatomists and artists, like the perfectionist Bernhard Siegfried Albinus and the imaginative Jan Wandelaar, generated prints of meticulous bodies set against vivid landscapes.“Anatomy and the Antique” shows how ancient statues were dissected in drawings; artists turned to classical works like the Apollo Belvedere as anatomical and artistic models. The show neatly reinforces these connections by placing a Roman torso from the Getty collection next to a woodcut from De Fabrica that illustrates abdominal organs spilling from a similar statue.Anatomical models depicted idealized bodies, with flaws smoothed out. The value placed on certain body types was reinforced in their images: the ideal figures of Apollo and Venus in Greco-Roman tradition, and Adam and Eve in Christianity, proliferated images of muscular men and fleshy, fertile women down the centuries. Although the drawings were meant to represent ideal humans, anatomists often sought or stole bodies for dissection that were deemed of less value, including those of people convicted of crimes. While the show touches on this complexity, it does not delve into pathological anatomy, drawings of bodies that deviated from the ideal based on shape or because of disease. It would be fascinating to see the topic addressed in a subsequent exhibition that builds from this foundation.The show’s wealth of material leads visitors to consider the body on a number of levels, from a section on “Surface Anatomy” explaining how artists like Leonardo surmounted drawing the body to anatomical models with deeper dimensionality in “Seeing in 3D.” The thematic organization also intermixes a few contemporary works. OG Abel’s 2012 “Love and Hate” evokes Dia de los Muertos makeup in counterpoint to the first section’s representations of death, while Tavares Strachan’s pulsating neon skeleton “Robert” (2018) memorializes the first Black American astronaut, Robert Lawrence, in the final section of the show. They are stirring works, though more context may have helped them feel as cohesive as the rigorous research in the rest the show.“Everybody’s interested in their body,” Kornell said. Getting “inside the body tells who we are, how we work, [and] how we’ve figured that out over the centuries.” Even today, when imaging technology can provide all kinds of anatomical illumination, illustrations still provide useful ways of slicing and dicing (so to speak) to clarify the body’s relevant details. As the show reveals, art translates the complexity of the body to make legible whichever aspects of it we most need to understand.Flesh and Bones: The Art of Anatomy continues at the Getty Research Institute (200 Getty Center Dr #1100, Brentwood, Los Angeles) through July 10.

		<title>Art as an Exercise in Moving Through Grief</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 540  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/IMG_5554.jpg?fit=720%2C540 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure What’s clear in  i These Conditions /i  is artist Adelita Husni Bey’s ambition to push art to be more than an exercise in spectatorship.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents In the spring of 2021, the New York-based Italian artist Adelita Husni Bey spent six weeks meeting over Zoom with Danish and American nurses, who recalled their experiences of deplorable working conditions and the consequent physical and psychological depletion in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting 30-minute video, On Necessary Work (2021), is part of Husni Bey’s exhibition, These Conditions, currently at the Annex at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Coney Island, presented by the Vera List Center for Art and Politics, as part of the artist’s two-year fellowship project, The School of Pandemics. Curated by Eriola Pira and Carin Kuoni, the show also includes a sound installation, a room filled with work centered on the AIDS crisis, another room remade as a domestic space, a two-month-long political-theater workshop with necessary workers, and live performances.The Annex was eerily quiet the day I visited. Without realizing that it had been built as a supply base during the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the emptiness of the exposed-concrete basement nevertheless struck in me an unsettling chord, offset by a beatific light streaming through windows — a fitting contrast, since the show itself pairs the resurgence and persistence of grief and trauma with a yearning to find commonality in pain, and to move not past but through it. Some of the issues the nurses raised rang familiar from news coverage over the past two years: stories of loneliness, numbing daily routines, a corporate takeover of public health, and pressures to cut costs, which left hospital workers toiling beyond the already inhumane hours — as one nurse put it in the video, it felt as if working in urgent care were like “flipping burgers.” All workshop participants were women, so their complaint that hospital workers are “the lowest of the lowest rung” in healthcare had an acute sting of institutional gender bias. The women found a visual-spatial metaphor to express the absurd dissonance between being the desperately needed “essential” workers, yet seeing their work devalued: A hand enters the frame before the camera and yanks an item from a stack of objects, causing its collapse.Husni Bey’s art-political environment evokes an echo chamber, especially striking since so much of what it reverberates is the anguish of silence and absence. The artist herself suggests this idea in the video, when she tells the nurses that their conversations — and the videos they shared — made her think of “a kind of ghost.” She follows her comment with extreme close-ups split across three screens of a nurse’s uniform, the camera slowly traveling up until it zooms out, in a framing that suggests depersonalization, but also a pervasive, disembodied haunting. Maybe the challenge then is not to exorcise the ghost — as we might rush to do after a trauma — but to find metaphors and tangible manifestations that capture its collective “silent roar.” The impact of the show hinges on sensory deprivation not as a hindrance but as a pathway to restoration, starting with the space’s austerity, which suggests a kind of ante-room of feeling — or so it seemed to me as I wandered into the “living room,” delineated by plywood walls. The spare space contained a sofa, a table, a locker, and a few drawings in childlike hand. Rather than something to look at, it struck me as a holding place. (I later learned from Husni Bey that two workshop participants conceived it to recreate their own environments.) Nevertheless, having recently lost my father to COVID-19, I felt a peculiar ownership of it, and a tug of disquiet. The phrase “silent roar” comes from a violinist in Husni Bey’s sound work in five movements, Cronaca del Tempo Ripetuto (A chronicle of histories repeating, 2021) — five improvisations, in collaboration with Chamber Orchestra of Radicondoli, Tuscany, and the participation of Rabèl Theatrical Association, in response to pandemic lockdown — also featured in the show. In the accompanying libretto, the artist cites a book by the Italian writer Constantino Antichi, which describes gravediggers during the 1631-33 plague in Italy carrying bodies on stretchers, to avoid carts rattling on cobblestones — eliminating sound to counter fear. As an antidote to this silencing, Husni-Bey reinstates the deliberately staggered, piercingly solitary notes.Husni Bey’s varied approaches make it harder to define her aims — what we often call the “pay-off,” following capitalist terminology — but her work does address the need for “recovery.” In the video, Cady Chaplin, a nurse from Chicago, speaks of crying when a coworker held her, as she suddenly realized she hadn’t been touched in months. But the video’s formal devices — a split screen, a multiplicity of windows — leaves open the question of whether or not Zooming provides a sense of connection. There was more closeness in the live performance’s dedicated close-eyed movement exploration, by the group Duvet. In the two parts I saw, a dancer first moved about the space blindfolded, while an accompanying guide prevented him from bumping into walls; then two female dancers performed, and at one point became entangled in each other’s arms. Body as armor, as protector, as a “nurse,” came to my mind, while in the adjacent space — another plywood room — The Ashes Action (DIVA TV, 1992), a video documenting an ACT UP! protest, showed gay men locking arms in a body wall, to prevent the police from picking them out, one by one. The ACT UP! video was the one element in the show that directly reflected Husni Bey’s interest in social movements, and specifically social change, in the wake of crises. (Although one might ask what exactly has changed in public response to them — if anything, the show’s historical timeline stresses a tragic recurrence, with public health in the grip of pharmaceutical lobbies and profiteers, rather than undergoing a meaningful labor reform or empathic evolution.) In this sense, the show’s current configuration doesn’t yet fully delve into the sociopolitical dimension of Husni Bey’s practice. It may in the future, when she presents the video she’s currently making of the political-theater workshop, conducted in the space with a small group of necessary workers (it’s slated to premiere at the New School in the fall of 2022, and then at Castello di Rivoli in Turin, Italy). As she described it to me, it reflects her research on past pandemics and the workers’ experiences. What’s already clear, though, is the ambition of Husni Bey’s multivalent practice. It pushes art to be more than an exercise in spectatorship. Even if I’m not sure how sounds and other metaphors for the pandemic (all of which we so urgently need to survive it) may become a platform for broader social change, These Conditions nevertheless resonates as a passionately pedagogic, interdisciplinary laboratory for communal knowledge.These Conditions continues at the Annex at the Brooklyn Army Terminal (80 58th St, Sunset Park, Brooklyn) through April 8.

		<title>Reckoning with Israeli Censorship Through Autofiction</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 302  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/aheds-knee-2.jpeg?fit=720%2C302 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure  i Ahed’s Knee /i  is the latest film by Nadav Lapid to use a fictionalized version of the filmmaker to inveigh against societal injustice.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Autofiction has been a novelistic genre for nearly half a century, initially gaining prominence in France, but since 2008, its popularity has exploded worldwide. Claus Elholm Andersen, who is finishing up a book on Karl Ove Knausgård, recently appeared on the High Theory podcast, where he shared his opinion that when society is confronted with the idea that it is based on fictions (as seen in the wake of the financial crisis), people then turn to fiction as a means of telling the truth. With his newest film, Ahed’s Knee, Israeli director Nadav Lapid explores such themes through a heavily autobiographical story about personal tragedy and state censorship. The title refers to Ahed Tamimi, a young Palestinian activist who made international headlines after a video of her slapping Israeli soldiers went viral. The lead character, a director known only as “Y.” (Avshalom Pollak) wants to use cinema to expose the continued lies and illusions Israel has built its statehood upon. The story opens with Y. auditioning actresses for the role of Ahed, who is to be the subject of his next work. With an editing style reminiscent of late ’60s Godard, Ahed’s Knee deconstructs the boundaries between bodies, temporalities, and spaces as part of a polemic against Israeli state censorship. The film is structured visually around placid suburbs that feel alien in the desert. Y. is taking a break from production on his movie about Tamimi to present a screening of a previous work at a small-town library. But a few hours before, Yohalom (Nur Fibak), a friendly young Ministry of Culture worker, hands him a form outlining which topics he’s allowed to discuss at the post-screening Q A. If he doesn’t uphold the agreement, he won’t be paid. Y. decides to leverage his position to expose the Ministry for its censorship, even if doing so ruins Yohalom’s career.Ahed’s Knee explores the complexity of how “good,” “nice” people often find themselves as the face of oppression. Y. likes Yohalom; they flirt and discuss art. He understands that she’s well-intentioned and doesn’t like what she’s asking him to do. On the other hand, he’s curt and aloof, cold and snobbish. His sexual appetites are ravenous, often uncaring. He’s internalized his disgust with Israeli society by becoming almost monstrous himself, particularly after the recent loss of his mother. He’s torn over his conviction to violate his contract because Yohalom is a cog in a system, and it’s unclear whether taking a political stand will even do anything beyond further strain his relationship with state arts funding and take away her future. The story is a battleground of moral debate. Lapid doesn’t waver on the idea that Israel is an oppressor — the question is instead what constitutes the best, most ethical way to fight the system, and what it means to be a product of such an environment. Y. is the latest in a series of similar “Y”s and Yoavs present in nearly every one of Lapid’s films, each of whom are fictional stand-ins for an artist grappling with his identity. The Yoav of his previous movie, 2019’s Synonyms, immigrates from Israel to France and refuses to speak Hebrew in an attempt to distance himself from militarization and state violence. In contrast, this Y. has to grapple with the truth that “geography wins,” and we can’t escape our homelands. Both Y. and Lapid were born and raised in Tel Aviv. Besides Tamimi, a heavy inspiration was the “Loyalty in Culture” bill, which would have revoked government funding for any artist who would “contravene the principles of the state.” And around that same time, Lapid’s own mother died. The story is based directly on an experience Lapid had showing his film The Kindergarten Teacher in a small town. Much as Andersen argues, Lapid’s engagement with autofiction seems born from disillusionment. His repeated insertion of himself into these works becomes a study in a man whose identity is tied so closely to a society built on oppression. Ahed’s Knee thus acts like an exorcism, a reckoning with political obligation and what it means to be good on a social versus an interpersonal level. The unmade film within a film about Ahed Tamimi becomes commentary on how artists can use the stories of others to evade true self-reflection. In contrast to Synonyms, this is a story about someone who has stopped running from their past. Ahed Tamimi’s story does not belong to Lapid, but the responsibility of dismantling Israel’s oppression of Palestinians does not lie only with Palestinians.Ahed’s Knee is now playing in select theaters.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>What Our Use of Holograms Says About How We Remember</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 520  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Beka-Bryer-Survivor-Hologram.jpeg?fit=720%2C520 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure What holograms offer only reminds us that the types of audience interaction they invite cannot fully animate the past.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents In late May 2022, the Swedish pop group ABBA will open a seven-month residency in London’s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, or, at least, their digital representations will. Almost 40 years after their last music release, ABBA announced in September 2021 that they would begin “performing” again as digital avatars called ABBAtars. The ABBAtars, created from filming the four singers of ABBA in motion capture over eight weeks, de-ages the pop group to their 1979 selves in order to “perform at [their] very best,” according to the band’s website. London audiences are invited to see ABBA in their glory, in a concert that would never have existed during their heyday.This turn towards digital performance is not wholly new in the music industry, where deceased musicians like Tupac Shakur and Michael Jackson have both become projected figures in guest appearances at music festivals and award shows.It is also not new in the field of museums, where the Illinois Holocaust Museum has had holograms of Holocaust survivors relating their testimony since 2017 through the Survivor Stories Experience exhibit.Fearing that the loss of physical dialogue will remove the critical work of remembering past atrocities, the holograms at the Illinois Holocaust Museum are intended to preserve the testimony and memory of survivors. Both the ABBAtars and the Holocaust survivor holograms attempt to recreate presence. The existence of these types of performance requires us as audience members to consider what digital representations, from musical acts to the sharing of testimonials, can actually provide when it comes to engaging with the past.The motion capture of ABBA for concert performances and the Holocaust survivor holograms have different aims, but their use of curation, reinterpretation, and technology make them intriguing examples of this phenomenon. The ABBAtars are creating, per the band’s own language, “the concert [they’ve] always wanted you to have.” This concert was not one ABBA would have performed in 1979, not only because they won’t be physically present, but also because they can perform songs from their new album Voyage (2021) as their 1979 digitized selves. The singers, now in their 70s, can have their performances live on for fans who were not born during their peak of success, and they can do so while explicitly making the type of presentation they want their audiences to see. The past is in the present, even when it should be impossible.The holograms of Holocaust survivors at the Illinois Holocaust Museum, on the other hand, demonstrate what happens when digitized performance is based in audience interaction. In participating in the Survivor Stories Experience, audience members can ask questions of the hologram they choose. Mediated by a docent, the voice recognition software allows a visitor to get an answer from a hologram, and selects for the visitors what stories they may hear from Holocaust survivors who agreed to be rendered in such a way. Unlike how the ABBAtars are purported to function, these holograms are in some way reactive to the people who come to see them. The testimony they bring forth is limited by what was filmed and collected, but it nevertheless captures some of the memories of survivors before they pass away.Holograms, however, cannot fully recreate flesh and blood live performance or testimony, and what they offer only reminds us that these types of audience interaction cannot fully animate the past. When I visited the Illinois Holocaust Museum in 2018, the survivor I “spoke” to, Aaron Elster, had recently passed away and the museum was showing his testimony as tribute to his life and work. It was all too clear, sitting in the auditorium, that I was watching not the man, but his recorded memories about his trauma. While this fact did not diminish the power of his testimony, I knew that the hologram could not match the physical man digitally rendered in front of me. It is a blessing to have the technology (from the USC Shoah Foundation) to have Elster’s testimony in such a captivating way, but it cannot bridge the loss of him fully.The ABBAtars will likely be confronted with a similar phenomenon when they debut this May. A digitized version of ABBA will certainly be a sight to behold and will most likely create the party that the band is hoping for over seven months in London. But they, and any digitally rendered performance of this ilk, cannot hope to capture the past in the ways that they may wish to. What they can offer, though, is a very different way for audiences to engage with the past that can supplement all the other avenues we already know.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Iconic Warhol Marilyn Could Fetch $200 Million, Set Records for 20th-Century Art</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 715  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Warhol-Marilyn.jpg?fit=720%2C715 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Christie s says the sale will benefit a foundation  dedicated to improving the lives of children. </description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents An iconic 1964 silkscreen portrait of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol, estimated at $200 million — which, if achieved, would make the painting the most expensive 20th-century painting to be sold at auction — is headed to Christie’s in May.Titled “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn,” the painting belongs to a series commonly known as the Shot Marilyns, comprised of four individual portraits of the star whose name became synonymous with the manic hypersexualization of famous women in 1950s and ’60s Hollywood culture. Each square canvas in the series measures 40 by 40 inches, with identical facial outlines and backgrounds painted variously red, orange, light blue, and sage blue. After the actress died from a drug overdose that was ceaselessly sensationalized in the media, Monroe became one of Warhol’s favorite subjects throughout the 1960s, with all of his paintings of her using the same Niagara (1953) publicity photo. Examples hang in some of the most prestigious institutions in the world, including the Tate in London and the Cleveland Museum of Art. The Shot Marilyns got their name when performance artist and friend-of-a-friend Dorothy Podber visited Warhol at his New York studio, which he called the Factory. Noticing a stack of freshly-painted works, Podber asked Warhol if she could shoot them. Warhol, assuming that she was asking for permission to photograph them, said yes, before Podber drew out a revolver and shot a bullet through the foreheads of the Marilyns. A few years later, Valerie Solanas would shoot and nearly kill Warhol at the Factory, imbuing the paintings’ scars with additional significance.Christie’s will be auctioning the work in a philanthropic sale to benefit the new Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation Zürich, which a press release describes as “dedicated to improving the lives of children the world over by establishing support systems centered on providing healthcare and educational programs.” The Ammanns were siblings and ran a gallery in Zürich beginning in the late 1970s, dealing in works spanning the Impressionist period to contemporary art. Doris headed the gallery until last year, when she died at the age of 76.Hyperallergic has contacted Christie’s and Thomas Ammann Fine Art to request additional details on the Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation. Fortune reports that the foundation has committed to funding children’s health and education causes for the next three to six years and will be funded in part by the sale of the portrait.Georg Frei, chairman of the board of the foundation and partner of the late Doris Ammann, said in a statement that the painting “isolates the person and the star: Marilyn the woman is gone; the terrible circumstances of her life and death are forgotten.” He compared Monroe’s smile to that of the Mona Lisa, echoing a parallel drawn by Alex Rotter, Christie’s chairman of 20th- and 21st-century art. Calling the work “the absolute pinnacle of American Pop and the promise of the American Dream,” Rotter indicated that it stands beside Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus,” Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa,” and Picasso’s “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon” as one of the “greatest paintings of all time.”The sale in May will also test the current valuation of Warhol’s masterpieces. Last fall, Sotheby’s sold “Nine Marilyns,” a nearly seven-foot-tall, black-and-white silkscreen from 1962, for $47.4 million. Sotheby’s also sold Warhol’s most expensive work to date, “Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)” (1963), which fetched $105.4 million in 2013. According to Bloomberg, works by Warhol have sold privately for over $100 million.“Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” is distinguished by the method Warhol used to produce it — a more detailed and demanding technique that he developed in 1964 and used very sparingly because it was so involved. He abandoned that process after creating a small number of the Marilyn portraits, according to Christie’s press release. The most recent sale of a work from the Shot Marilyn series occurred in 2007, when hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner Steven Cohen purchased the turquoise one in 2007 for $80 million. The two other canvases in the group belong to publisher Peter Brant — who purchased the light blue canvas for a mere $5,000 in 1967 — and shipping heir Philip Niarchos — who bought the red one for $3.6 million in 1994.

		<title>Arts Sector Shrank at Twice the Rate of US Economy During Pandemic, NEA Finds</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 481  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/amin-hasani-CLmEEcyBV8Y-unsplash.jpg?fit=720%2C481 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure While arts and cultural institutions regained some ground during 2021, they have not yet returned to 2019 levels.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents For nearly a year after the initial March 2020 lockdowns across the United States, economic productivity throughout the arts sector came to a standstill, as closures affected employment and revenue for museums, theaters, and art spaces nationwide. COVID-19’s impact on the arts has been undeniable, but new data released last week by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) quantifies the extent of the damage: Between 2019 and 2020, the arts economy shrank at nearly twice the rate of the US economy as a whole. The arts represent a broad and varied sector of local, institutional, and national organizations, and the majority of artists working in the US are either self-employed or independently contracted. The NEA says that arts and cultural production fell by 6.4% when adjusted for inflation, compared to a 3.4% decline in the economy overall. The value added by self-employed artists, writers, and performers fell by 20.6%, and, according to the NEA’s analysis, the unemployment rate across arts and culture industries shot up from 3.7% in 2019 to 10.3% in 2020.The NEA reports that while arts and cultural industries regained some ground during 2021, they have not yet returned to 2019 income and activity levels. Several independently owned arts and cultural spaces that initially closed in 2020 never reopened their doors after suffering irremediable economic losses, and others held on by a thread of support from government subsidies and community aid.With theaters and live performance spaces shuttered for nearly a year, the film and performing arts industries were predictably among the hardest hit. The film industry lost approximately 136,000 workers when COVID-19 halted all production, and while many studios have since resumed in-person work, many safety protocols have persisted. Government arts and cultural contributions remained steady during the pandemic. Despite reduced production, arts and culture managed to add $876.7 billion to the national GDP in 2020, down from $919.7 billion in 2019. The findings also highlight that third quarter performing arts revenue doubled from $834 million in 2020 to $1.7 billion in 2021, yet that amount lags behind the $12.7 billion earned in 2019.“While arts and cultural industries and workers nationwide have sustained heavy losses, the sector continues to play an outsized role in the U.S. economy — as the new data demonstrate,” NEA Chair Dr. Maria Rosario Jackson said in a statement. Rosario Jackson points to an interesting trend within the sector: That summer of self-isolation and the onset of remote work catalyzed a mass transition to digital arts programming. Gallery openings and live performances, which were once strictly in-person affairs, could be accessed from the comfort of one’s home, and this proliferation of digital media engagement increased economic value by 14.3% between 2019 and 2020, employing 12,000 salaried workers. The Arts and Cultural Production Satellite Account (ACPSA) compiled data fact sheets illustrating the value that the arts and culture sector added to local economies across the 50 states in 2020. In New York alone, the arts contributed $126.7 billion, which amounts to 7.3% of the state’s overall economic value, and independent artists supplied approximately $5 million overall. While COVID-19’s toll on the creative economy has been significant, for the NEA, sustained value added is a clear indicator of progress and a reason to advocate for greater support of the creative sector. “The NEA is committed to participating as a key partner in the recovery of this sector, recognizing not only its economic value, but also the arts’ capacity to transform the lives of individuals and communities in other ways, contributing to health and well-being, and overall resilience,” Rosario Jackson added. Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Marina Abramović Will Restage “The Artist Is Present” to Raise Funds For Ukraine</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 473  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/6-Copyright-Marco-Aneli_Marina-with-Claus-MOMA-2010_1.jpg?fit=720%2C473 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Abramović is auctioning two opportunities to restage “The Artist Is Present,” with all funds going to a nonprofit assisting in aid efforts.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents It requires no personal connection to Ukraine to have compassion for the current plight of its citizens. People from across the international spectrum, from politicians to poets, are speaking out and sending aid as Ukrainians experience devastating Russian airstrikes on children’s hospitals, maternity wards, and most recently an art school sheltering some 400 individuals in the port city of Mariupol. At least 2,300 people have died in Mariupol alone, and those still alive are facing shortages of food, water, and electricity as invading forces hold the city under siege.The situation has inspired many artists and cultural institutions to agitate for change and raise funds for war relief. Among them is performance artist Marina Abramović, who will restage one of her most famous works in support of a crisis that is both universally and personally upsetting for her.“I really hurt,” Abramović said in an interview with W Magazine. “It hurts so much because war hurts in general.” But for the Yugoslavian-born artist (now Serbia), whose work draws from strong connections to her Eastern European origins, this conflict strikes close to home.“I have full solidarity with [the Ukrainian people] on this impossible day,” Abramović said in a video statement following the declaration of war by Russia on February 24. “An attack on Ukraine is an attack on all of us. It’s an attack on humanity and has to be stopped.”In a further demonstration of her support, Abramović has partnered with New York’s Sean Kelly Gallery and Artsy to offer a performance art meet-and-greet … or at least meet-and-silently-stare. Through March 25, interested parties can bid on one of two opportunities for a limited restaging of Abramović’s epic performance The Artist Is Present, which took place over the course of almost three months at the Museum of Modern Art in 2010. An encounter for a single person and a second encounter for two people will be captured by photographer Marco Anelli, who documented almost all of the 1,500 participants in the original performance — an attendance roster that included celebrities such as Lou Reed and Björk, and, famously, an emotional reunion with the artist’s ex, Ulay. All the proceeds of the unconventional fundraiser will go to Direct Relief, which is working with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health to provide urgent medical assistance as well as long-term aid to the many lives devastated by the war. Bidding will likely be lively for such a unique opportunity in service of a greater good. Both the single- and two-person experiences have now met their reserve price, surpassing the $10,000 and $15,000 mark, respectively. Abramović has not staged a work in New York for seven years, but in October of 2021, the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv unveiled Abramović’s “Crystal Wall of Crying,” an interactive “wall of healing” that commemorates the Jews killed in Ukraine’s capital during one of the biggest massacres of the Holocaust. It is poignant that a place where the artist sought to bring healing is suffering a new tragedy, and it makes sense that Abramović, who has made a career of transforming pain into redemption, wants to do her part.

		<title>Crypto Advocates Celebrate Quashing of EU’s “De Facto Bitcoin Ban”</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 405  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/1920px-Bitcoin_mining_farm.jpg?fit=720%2C405 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure The European Parliament has voted against a provision limiting energy-extensive mining mechanisms, which was seen as a threat to the crypto industry.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents In a vote last week on a draft of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) bill, a regulatory framework for digital assets in the European Union, the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) agreed to leave out a provision that many in the crypto industry have characterized as a “de facto Bitcoin ban.”The proposed provision was part of an effort to enforce minimum environmental sustainability standards for crypto assets — a key aim of the bill, along with supervision and consumer protection. It would have limited “proof of work” (PoW), an energy-extensive consensus mechanism that employs large amounts of CO2-emitting computational power and is used in popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as in the minting of many non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The parliamentary vote on MiCA and the quashing of the PoW provision coincide with a moment in which cryptocurrency advocates are on the defensive in response to United States and European lawmakers’ warnings that Russian oligarchs may capitalize on cryptocurrency to circumvent sanctions.The decision on the PoW provision, which was defeated with a 30-23 vote with six abstentions, has been described as a major victory for the crypto industry and its advocates, who feared that the MiCA provision would hinder innovation. Three days before the vote, French politician Pierre Person tweeted: “By banning Bitcoin and Ether, by complicating the use of NFT and DeFi, the European Parliament is mortgaging our monetary and financial sovereignty.” In a Twitter thread on the defeat of the provision, Patrick Hansen, head of strategy at the crypto start-up Unstoppable Finance, described the vote as a “big relief   political success for the bitcoin   crypto currency in the EU,” adding that “the crypto community in the EU has clearly become a political force!”BREAKING: The ECON committee of the EU Parliament just voted against the de-facto POW-ban: 32 against, 24 in favor.Big relief   political success for the bitcoin   crypto community in the EU💪💪Will share a breakdown of the vote and what’s next here in this thread. #BitcoinThe ample carbon footprint of PoW consensus mechanisms — a study by the University of Cambridge put Bitcoin’s energy consumption on par with that of a small country — has come under increasing scrutiny. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, the blockchain on which most NFTs are minted, uses PoW, though it has committed to eventually migrating to an alternative, more energy-efficient consensus mechanism called “proof of stake.” According to calculations by artist Memo Akten, the minting of an NFT currently uses an average of 142 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy, creating 83 kilograms of CO2; factor in bids, sales, and ownership transfers, and those numbers balloon even further. Atken calculated that the footprint of the average NFT on a marketplace like SuperRare “is equivalent to a EU resident’s total electric power consumption for more than a month, with emissions equivalent to driving for 1000 Km, or flying for 2 hours.”“Right now PoW accounts for similar emissions as all private jet flights,” artist Kyle McDonald, whose work has explored the environmental cost of crypto, told Hyperallergic. “Ethereum energy use alone is larger than that of Facebook and Google, combined. And NFTs make up around 10-20% of all activity on Ethereum. If PoW NFTs led to an overall emissions reduction for the arts, it would be harder to criticize. But that’s not what I’m seeing right now.”McDonald, who pointed out that the policies in MiCA were most pertinent to Bitcoin, added: “If cryptocurrencies can’t meet ‘minimum environmental sustainability standards,’ we need to ditch them. And if our representatives can’t protect us from environmental destruction, we need to ditch them too. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more direct action, like vandalism of mining facilities. Especially in the US, where miners are regularly re-opening abandoned natural gas wells and coal plants.”Dr. Tina Rivers Ryan, an art historian and curator at Albright-Knox Museum who has written extensively about NFTs, believes that artists and collectors should ask themselves what the potential costs — environmental and otherwise — of transacting with a particular blockchain might be, and whether the benefits outweigh them.“For some, the answer is: no blockchain is worth it. (It’s still entirely possible to sell digital art using just a sales agreement and a credit card.) Others are happy to work with the PoW blockchain Ethereum because of its historical role in the development of NFTs and the wealth that is currently stored in it,” Ryan said in an email to Hyperallergic. “Most digital artists I know fall in the middle, choosing to mint with a PoS blockchain like Tezos, where the average sales are lower, but so is the energy consumption.”Of the removal of the PoW provision, Jess Northend, policy lead of the Science and Innovation Unit at the nonprofit Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, told Hyperallergic that regulators should address crypto’s environmental impact “without stifling innovation.”“The amendment voted down this week would simply have shifted the use of Proof of Work elsewhere and likely had a range of unintended consequences, undermining the EU’s burgeoning crypto market,” Northend said. “Policy makers should instead support the use of Proof of Stake wherever possible, alongside renewable energy for mining, nudging the market towards less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms.”Further efforts to mitigate crypto’s substantial carbon footprint in Europe is in the cards: A parliamentary majority voted to pursue alternative legislation that would include crypto assets in the EU’s sustainable finance taxonomy, which would make it more difficult for mining companies to get funding but would not be as limiting as the MiCA provision.Speaking of behalf of the Socialists and Democrats, who abstained from the vote, Finnish Member of Parliament Eero Heinäluoma expressed disappointment over the results of the vote. “If we don’t curtail this massive carbon footprint by putting crypto-currencies on a more sustainable path, our efforts to combat the climate crisis and boost our energy independence risk being in vain,” he said in a statement.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents The International Studio   Curatorial Program presents Sharon Norwood’s Drawing Room, the first solo exhibition in New York by artist Sharon Norwood. The show is curated by Dr. Petrina Dacres and opens on Thursday, March 24, 2022, with a reception from 6 to 8pm.Originally from Jamaica, Sharon Norwood migrated to Canada as a child. She creates works that exploit the decorative intentions and joy of mark-making and gesturing, disrupt the White gaze and other passive notions of viewing “the other,” and question standing narratives and systems that shape how identities are understood.Drawing inspiration from the shape of Black hair, the starting point of Norwood’s work is often a curly line. In her abstract prints and paintings, she intertwines organic lines to act as gestural markings; in her ceramic sculptures and installations, the curly line surfaces in interwoven geometric shapes. Norwood’s formal gestures symbolically reference the Black body and its relationship to politics of labor, beauty, and race.Dr. Petrina Dacres is ISCP’s 2022 Jane Farver Memorial Fund resident. She is an independent curator and founding member of Tide Rising Art Projects, an organization created to support and promote contemporary Caribbean art and film, where she serves as its resident Curator and Education Director. Her work and research focus on Caribbean art, African diaspora art, public sculpture and memorials, and memory studies. Dr. Dacres has organized exhibitions at Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural   Educational Center, New York; the National Museum Jamaica, Kingston; and National Gallery of Jamaica, Kingston, among others. She is Head of the Art History Department at the Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts in Kingston, Jamaica.Sharon Norwood’s Drawing Room is on view March 24–May 27, 2022, at ISCP (1040 Metropolitan Ave., Brooklyn, New York).Open Hours: By appointment Monday–Friday, 10:30am–5:30pm.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Russian forces have bombed an art school in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol where more than 400 civilians had taken shelter, local officials said. It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians. In a Telegram message this weekend, Mariupol City Council said the building of G12 art school in Mariupol’s Left Bank district was destroyed in a Russian attack on Saturday, March 19. The number of casualties is still unknown. The building sheltered “women, children and the elderly,” the Telegram message said, adding that “peaceful people are still under the rubble.” Last week, Russian troops bombed Mariupol’s Drama Theater where more than 1,000 civilians were taking shelter from the war. About 130 people were reportedly rescued from the building while hundreds remain trapped under the ruins. Satellite images taken before the bombing showed the word “children” visibly inscribed in Russian on the ground in the front and behind the theater in the hope that Russian fighter jets would avoid targeting the building. The humanitarian crisis in Mariupol continues to escalate, three weeks after Russian forces laid siege on the city. This weekend, the Mariupol City Council has also alleged that thousands of locals had been kidnapped and deported to Russian territory. In a video address to his nation today, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the siege on Mariupol a “war crime.”“To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,” he said.Earlier in March, the United Nations Human Rights Council voted in favor of a commission to investigate alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Yevheniia Filipenko, Ukraine’s UN ambassador, told the council that there was “irrefutable evidence of gross and systematic human rights violations as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia.”     Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents One of my companions burst into tears when looking at Brier Patch, Hugh Hayden’s new installation in Madison Square Park. This wasn’t because of the artwork itself, which she proclaimed “cool and ugly at the same time.” It was because answering my question about what she thought of the work caused her to loosen her grasp on the balloon she was bringing home from a kindergarten classmate’s birthday party. Hayden has fashioned a hundred school desks from cedar logs salvaged from the New Jersey Pine Barrens and installed them in four groups spread across the park’s lawns. Spiny branches emerge from their seats and desktops, splaying off in all directions. I wanted to ask my children what they thought about the work because Hayden has explained that Brier Patch comments on education. The title refers to folktales about a wily rabbit who begs the fox who has captured him not to throw him into a nearby patch of thorny brambles. (In America, the folktales were most famously reincarnated in the “Uncle Remus” stories about Br’er Rabbit.) The angry fox, wishing to torment his victim, hurls him into the thorns … only for the rabbit to escape, since he knows how to navigate the seemingly impenetrable pathways through the patch.As my daughter sobbed, my seven-year-old son delivered his opinion. He couldn’t tell whether the work was ugly or beautiful, happy or sad. He would only say that it made him feel confused. Frustrated, I gave up on our cultural outing and delivered on the milkshakes I had promised from the in-park Shake Shack. Back home, reading Hayden’s interview with the New York Times, I realized my son was not so obtuse after all. Hayden said that Brier Patch’s branches could symbolize the barriers to education often present in the United States. On the other hand, he claims that the work can also symbolize that same system’s benefits. No one could sit on these seats, but they might imagine themselves finding a creative perch on the branches, sheltering within the system. The work can be seen as a critique or a celebration — or both — depending on the visitor’s frame of reference.Confusing, indeed. Or perhaps a better word might be evasive — Hayden escapes being pinned down by an interpretation just as surely as Br’er Rabbit escaped Br’er Fox.The one thing Brier Patch is not is a brier patch. The work originated as an installation of six desks at White Columns in 2018. There, the desks were pushed close enough together that their branches intertwined, creating a thicket in the gallery. But the desks in the park sit in widely spaced aisles. The tips of their branches brush up against each other overhead, like enclosed bowers arching over walks in a genteel garden. Nothing would prevent you from moving easily between the desks.One of the four groups of desks is branch-free. In the middle of the dense text on the park’s signage about the piece, a sentence notes that Hayden “offers” these desks to “individuals and groups to interact with the piece for contemplation or convening.” I haven’t yet seen anyone take up this offer, perhaps because these desks are surrounded by a fence — a low one, to be sure, but still a barrier. The soft, bright cedar desktops, ripe for doodling or carving, or even staining with Shake Shack ketchup, remain unscathed, more than a month into the installation’s January to May run.The Madison Square Park Conservancy, the nonprofit that manages the park through a public-private partnership, takes similar care of the space’s other features. Its Shake Shack, the chain’s founding location and a crucial partner in the park’s finances, bustles tidily. Parents, whether of dogs or children, have nothing to complain about in the park’s runs and playground. Even pollinators are provided for, with five bee homes scattered amid the greenery. Meanwhile, unhoused people, at-risk youth, protestors, and hustlers have somehow been encouraged to stay six blocks south, in Union Square Park.The Madison Square Park Conservancy has been commissioning temporary art installations for the park since 2004. The signs for Brier Patch describe “the diverse range” of the program’s artists, while informing us that the work draws from Hayden’s “experience as an American and African American.” Within the well-patrolled boundaries of the park, where you are never far from a delicately worded fundraising appeal, it’s hard not to see Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling. Many of Hayden’s other works, which also make surreal modifications to everyday objects, have much more bite. His American Hero series, which began in 2010 with a taxidermized buffalo mount given cornrows, points out the concealment of Black contributions to foundational American history. A sculpture of a police car draped in a white sheet, 2021’s “Boogey Man,” denounces the white supremacist ideals that underlie police brutality. And Hayden has taken meaningful steps to help others enter the brier patch of the art world, for example by donating works to raise funds for tuition for Black MFA and art history students and persuading the Public Art Fund to expand what had been a solo commission into a group show for other young artists of color.But in the wealthy bubble of Madison Square Park, Brier Patch allows viewers to pat themselves on the back for their mere awareness of inequalities in our educational systems. The parents walking past who send their children to private schools are not made to question their decisions. The nannies whose own children are in sub-par public schools are not encouraged to protest that inequality. Everyone just gets to take nice Instagram photos, since the work does indeed, as my daughter said, look cool. Brier Patch is a temporary outdoor installation, not a public monument, and so I won’t judge it as one. But, as we debate what kinds of new monuments should be built to symbolize our changing understanding of our country, it can serve as a reminder to ask about who is paying. If a monument is seen as an amenity, it is likely to turn into something pleasing to the most influential and deep-pocketed members of a community, regardless of an artist’s intent. Hugh Hayden: Brier Patch continues at Madison Square Park (Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue between 23rd Street and 26th Street, Flatiron and NoMad, Manhattan) through May 1.

		<title>Losing Ourselves in Liz Larner’s Shapeshifting Sculpture</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 509  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Corner-Basher.jpeg?fit=720%2C509 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents I was recently listening to an Anne Carson lecture on corners. Given at CUNY in 2018, the poet-classicist’s talk floatily triangulated between the introduction of a third actor in Sophoclean plays (corners move narrative forward), her father’s inability to orient himself amid mounting dementia (corners help us locate ourselves), and the corner as a form beyond the dialectic of inside and outside, or shelter and threat (corners are spatially distinct and psychologically freighted). I was drawn to the idea of moving the corner to the center, of recasting a space typically viewed as dustily incidental as a fulcrum of action.The gravity that Carson ascribes to corners sprang to mind when I encountered “Corner Basher” (1988), the first work — before the check-in desk, even — in Los Angeles-based sculptor Liz Larner’s most significant survey in more than 20 years, Liz Larner: Don’t put it back like it was at SculptureCenter. Among the earliest of the 28 artworks on view, which span from 1987 to 2021, “Corner Basher” activates a space that is normally invisible. The kinetic sculpture, which resembles a treacherous tetherball set, features a steel pole with a dangling metal ball hooked up to an electric motor. By flipping a switch and rotating a dial on an adjacent column, visitors to the space — with varying degrees of aggression, glee, and bemusement — can set the piece in motion, causing it to repeatedly wallop the walls of the corner in which it stands, at a range of velocities. As more people operate the machine over the course of time, the wall increasingly, incrementally, and a bit bathetically, crumbles into pieces on the floor. Conceived as a sly rejoinder to the macho-coded destructive robots of Mark Pauline’s performance collective Survival Research Laboratories, Larner’s collaborative “Corner Basher” literally lays the museum’s structure bare in a work of participatory institutional critique.In the nearby “Wrapped Corner” (1991), gleaming chains, turnbuckles, and brackets are kinkily pulled tight around the corner edge of a room in horizontal rows; “Too the Wall” (1990) features six delicately jointed steel and silver armatures, each holding a pale square of leather, suspended across a corner in increasingly taut tiers. These site-responsive drawings in space highlight the physical and social context in which the art and the viewer are situated, and, particularly by centering the anti-heroic corner, pose questions about the values that are reflected in both our built environments and the ways in which we move through those environments (or, show art in them). The feminist thrust of this undertaking is made overt in “Bird in Space” (1989): a reinterpretation of the (white, male) Romanian modernist Constantin Brancusi’s famous 1923 sculpture of a bird in flight, a pedestal-mounted phallic abstraction made from marble or bronze. Larner’s own abstract avian, its outstretched wings the size of the room, is constructed from bowed lengths of humble nylon cord held tensile between steel blocks. Slipping in and out of visibility based on the viewer’s position, this sweeping anti-monument asks gallery-goers to recognize where they stand and what they notice: to engage in the relatively unpolished and unsexy, intermittently rewarding, ongoing project of parsing the artworks’ nuances and thinking relationally.“I like to think of the viewer as more of a sensor, a being using every sense to understand an object,” said Larner in an interview with Mary Ceruti for the exhibition catalogue. Larner’s varied work allows us to feel our way toward meaning, often physically moving in the process. It can be difficult to identify, as the artist put it in a recent interview with Jeffrey Kastner, a traditional “throughline” in her oeuvre (despite the art historical record’s repeated attempts to shoehorn her into post-minimalism). The pieces in the show are wildly disparate, ranging from abstract to figurative and from microscopic to massive, executed in media as diverse as false eyelashes, bronze, porcelain, leather, and steel. They reflect a body of work with a slippery habit of shapeshifting, characterized by a commitment to an active viewing experience and materiality itself, rather than any one material or aesthetic.Larner, who graduated from CalArts with a BFA in photography in 1985, found her way to sculpture organically, via bacterial cultures that she had been cultivating with nutrient agar in petri dishes. Though she initially produced these experiments to photograph them, the artist became interested in letting them unfold as process works in three-dimensional space, giving rise to the cleverly titled Cultures series (1987-ongoing). In “Orchid, Buttermilk, Penny” (1987), the titular items decompose — altering one another’s chemical compositions in the process — in two petri dishes encased in glass atop a pedestal. “Primary, Secondary: Culture of Empire State Building and Twin Towers” (1988), a landscape to the former still life, is an architectonic glass-and-aluminum display of two petri dishes with colorful, crispy material grown from cultures taken at those corporate, seemingly inorganic locations. Exploring representation on a literal, material level, these works set biochemical assemblages into motion, evincing Larner’s early interest in sympoesis and an exploratory, collaborative approach to making that is also at the heart of “Corner Basher.”Encountering the solitary “smile (after dark)” (2009), a somewhat ominous, inky length of shiny porcelain upturned at the corners, conjures up Alice’s wonderment: “I’ve often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!” From 1996 to 2011, Larner labored on the smile series, a group of abstracted, disembodied grins made from casting foamcore forms in porcelain, a material also used in dental veneers. “smile (after dark)” is hollow, literally. Its unevenly faceted, intermittently lacerated surface makes it difficult to discern the inside from the outside (like a corner), prompting the viewer to scrutinize a detached gesture that is seen as shorthand for joy but so often contains grimacing gradations of ambivalence, obligation, resentment, or anger — perhaps particularly among people repeatedly told to smile.Larner, who lives and works in the birthplace of the anti-utilitarian California Clay Revolution, has since turned to the softer, more porous medium of ceramics, her focus throughout the past decade. Like the Cultures, ceramics inherently require the artist to cede a measure of authorship to nature and entropy: after the clay, teeming with microorganisms, is dug from the earth, worked, and shaped, it hardens into being in the kiln — cracking and warping as it sees fit — outside of the artist’s sight and out of her hands. A sequence of large, wall-mounted ceramic lozenges, begun in 2013, line a lower-level hallway. Glazed or painted in arresting hues and titled after geological phenomena, they include “subduction” (2013), a deep, shifting well of indigo; “inflexion” (2013), a blue morpho butterfly’s shimmering azure; and “vi (calefaction)” (2015), a navy ombre studded with chunky stones and minerals to a celestial effect. Alluding to the fault lines that run through fired clay and earth alike, each thick slab is intractably cracked, from hairline fissures and crumbling edges to clean rips down the middle, visual pauses that riff on Barnett Newman’s zip paintings. The viewer slips, unsettled, between art historical time and geological time; micro and macro; chance and intention; nature and culture. Through a longstanding practice of regarding her materials and audience as her co-creators, and approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment rather than a static or foreclosed object, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work. The inner unsteadiness — the searching — that this push-and-pull sets in motion is the main event.Liz Larner: Don’t put it back like it was continues at SculptureCenter (44-19 Purves St, Long Island City, Queens) through March 28 and will travel to the Walker Art Center (725 Vineland Place, Minneapolis, Minnesota) from April 30 to September 4.

		<title>Southwestern Association for Indian Arts Launches New Art Fair</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 480  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/NAS-PaintingIsTaxing-2.jpg?fit=720%2C480 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents SANTA FE, NM — The art world underwent something of a reckoning in 2017 when The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York decided to display Native American works in its American Wing for the first time.“It was a spark,” says veteran art show producer Kim Martindale about Art of Native America: The Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, an exhibition that premiered in 2018. “It forced The Met to say, ‘No, it’s part of American art.’ It’s the first American art and therefore other museums really need it in their collections rather than shoving it to the side and into the tribal ethnographic portion.”Martindale — channeling this renewed and overdue attention toward Indigenous art — is producer and director of Art Indigenous Santa Fe. The inaugural contemporary art fair, scheduled to take place this summer during the centennial Southwestern Association for Indian Arts’s Santa Fe Indian Market, has been billed as the first of its kind in the world, where contemporary Indigenous fine art galleries will gather for four days in New Mexico’s capital city. Martindale hopes to expand the Art Indigenous concept — which will feature sculpture, painting, photography, installation, and performance — to other cities.Martindale, who says that he produced the LA Art Show for a quarter-century, is a longtime worldwide art fair attendee. For years, the lack of global representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists nagged at him.“It doesn’t make sense,” he says. “Why isn’t there a show for contemporary artists from Indigenous lineage, and why don’t we see more of that art at some of these major shows?”Along with The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s inclusion of Native American art, Martindale says another milestone took place when the Upper East Side institution hired Patricia Marroquin Norby (Purépecha) as its first full-time curator of Native American art.“One thing led to another and now there’s a dialog in art museums saying that if you want to have a complete collection of American art, then you need Native American and Indigenous art in the US and Canada in your collection,” says Martindale. “I think this is all gelling together at this moment in time.”The idea for Art Indigenous Santa Fe took off due to the upcoming centennial anniversary of the Santa Fe Indian Market, which is scheduled to take place in an in-person format. The popular event, said to be North America’s largest and most important juried Indigenous art market, is helmed by Native American woman Kim Peone (Colville Confederated Tribes and Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians). The market, which has drawn upwards of 150,000 visitors to New Mexico’s capital city, features Native artists displaying and selling their works in and around the historic Santa Fe Plaza.Martindale was also encouraged to move forward after attending 2021 Art Basel Miami Beach in Florida. There, for the first time, he noticed that an installation and performance piece section of the fair included a Native American artist. “I thought, ‘Yes. Finally. It’s happening,’” he says.A partial list of participating Art Indigenous Santa Fe galleries is expected to be announced in April 2022; Martindale says the full roster, which he anticipates will be in the range of 30 to 40 galleries, will drop in May. An Art Indigenous Santa Fe preview event is scheduled from 6 to 10 pm on Thursday, August 18 at El Museo de Cultural de Santa Fe at the Railyard Arts District, and the show will run through Sunday, August 21.“We’re not taking away anything from Indian Market, but rather adding to Indian Market, and bringing in a whole other group of collectors that maybe wouldn’t come to town for Indian Market,” says Martindale. “With this gallery-oriented show, we’re presenting these artists that have not participated in Indian Market for years or never have.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents ARCAthens, a nonprofit founded in 2017 with the aim of supporting visual artists, curators, and scholars through cultural exchange between New York and Athens, Greece, just published its first open call for applications for its residency program taking place this fall. Two Athens residency fellowships will be available — one for a visual art fellow and the other for a curatorial fellow — and they will fully fund residents as they live and work in Athens for a duration of two months.Unlike previous years, when fellows were chosen by nomination, applicants from all countries are now welcome to apply, as long as they reside outside of Greece. The residency begins on September 19, 2022 and lasts until November 14. A total fellowship award of $2,000 will be granted to the two chosen fellows, along with a $150 weekly stipend and round trip airfare. The “live-work facilities” on offer include a “gorgeous neoclassical facility” operated by ARCAthens’ partner and contemporary arts organization ATOPOS; each fellow will be accommodated with a private bedroom, private studio, and shared kitchen, bathroom, dining room, and library.Past ARCAthens fellows include artists Tomashi Jackson and Cullen Washington, Jr., and curators Miranda Lash and Larry Ossei-Mensah. If accepted, fellows will be expected to participate in a seminar with students at the Athens School of Fine Arts and a public end-of-year residency event. “Athens is known for its ancient history, its radiant light, its delightful weather, gorgeous landscape, warm people, rich culture, and delicious food,” says ARCAthens Executive Director Aristides Logothetis in a statement. “Athens, which is also known as a destination for all things modern, is now becoming a vibrant hub of contemporary culture, providing our fellows with an additional lens from which to understand our world today.” ARCAthens also hosts a virtual residency, which began during the pandemic, in which a curator selects two artists — one from Greece and one from the Bronx, New York — to collaborate and exchange ideas through social media.

		<title>The Backlash Against Oil Sponsorship Can Push for Broader Change in Museums</title>

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Documents published last week by Culture Unstained show the British Museum is exploring extending its extremely unpopular partnership with BP. It seems that a decade of protest, and the example of several other museums cutting ties with the company, hasn’t changed anything — the museum is still performing gratitude to the oil giant for its generosity. There are so many things about the British Museum to criticize, but its complicity in BP’s artwashing ranks alongside the museum’s continual refusal to engage with its own colonial history and its total rejection of any requests for the repatriation of looted objects held in its collection. It’s these issues, and the connections between them, that are most significant — two high-profile movements that challenge the way we engage with the British Museum and have consequences that can be felt beyond its walls.There is, broadly, a disconnect between these movements. There are plenty of organizers who move between both spaces, but the public coverage and popular response tends to separate them. Talking about BP leads to the allegation that you’re ignoring the colonialist violence of the museum itself, while focusing on restitution is read as though you’re not thinking about the environmental impact of oil companies.Even as anti-colonial consciousness grows and there is a greater public awareness and involvement in campaigns for restitution, there’s a tendency to not see the modernity of this fight. It’s still bleakly common, even among people who are engaged with these conversations, to see the act of colonialism as an element of the past, and its consequences in the present, but not to consider the ways that colonial exploitation is still active. The language used by museums, the way imperialism is neatly sectioned off into history, the way institutions work to perpetuate the myth that these communities have simply faded passively away, the euphemisms around acquisitions, add to the impression that the actual moment of violence is over. We’re talking about the systematic displacement of communities from their homes, the destruction of cultural landscapes in the pursuit of profit, and the abuse of marginalized laborers to produce wealth in the cultural West. How can this be anything other than a continuation of colonialism?There is an incredible opportunity here for collaborations that can lead to real and meaningful change. In my own experience, it works both ways: People involved in climate justice campaigns are open to learning about the exclusionary history of these spaces, just as those who explore the racism and violence at a museum’s heart are able to consider modern forms of injustice and inequality. The trick, if you like, of museums is to collapse time, to shrink history and geography until we can see all things at once. This same compression can be an opportunity. The flattened structure of a museum works to create comparisons, and we can use those in building solidarity. The best tool at our disposal is context: showing the repetitions of history and exploring the parallels between the imperialist exploitation of people and extraction of resources and wealth, and the neo-colonial violence with which corporations carelessly destroy our environment in pursuit of profit.So how do we pull these threads together? Climate crisis disproportionately affects those who are already marginalized racially and economically, and it is crucial to keep in mind how that marginalization was created in the first place. The organization BP or Not BP has consistently worked to highlight the essentially neo-colonial nature of oil companies, and platform the voices of campaigners for restitution with their “Stolen Goods” tours, and interventions that contrast the BP-funded Stonehenge exhibition at the British Museum with the damage done by BP drilling into the petroglyphs at Murujuga on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia. The Stop Adani movement in Australia has also walked this line effectively so far. The Adani coal mines would devastate Wangan and Jagalingou lands, and displace communities in Godda to build power stations — an environmental issue that keeps the people most directly harmed at its center. And Members of the Indigenous communities impacted by these mines have led the campaign against Adani’s controversial sponsorship of the Science Museum’s “Green Energy Gallery,” emphasizing that this is cultural as well as environmental destruction.For historians and educators, there’s also a responsibility to address the deeper history of artwashing. The wealthy individuals who influenced the British Museum’s collections and curatorial narratives in the 19th century have their parallels in the sketchy Chairman’s Advisory Group, a group of anonymous representatives from massive corporations who have an unofficial role in steering the museum’s decisions today. Museums under capitalism can’t be completely divorced from these financial influences, but they can at least be transparent about them, and they have to expect that they’ll face scrutiny for them.Pulling these threads together is crucial. A change in sponsorship without the restitution of stolen objects would be inadequate, just as engaging in anticolonial work without considering modern forms of destruction and marginalization is meaningless. We need both, together. The museum is not a space of equality — it’s governed by uneven power and shaped by privilege, not a reflection of the world around it; nor is it an institution that consistently serves the public. This inequality is obvious to anyone kept away from their own cultural heritage by its cabinets. For those who don’t personally experience the museum’s inequality, or don’t see it as immediately affecting them, being able to point to these concrete examples of deception and complicity can help us bridge the gap. The energy and creativity of climate justice protests combined with the rigor and determination of anticolonial movements is formidable. With solidarity and effort, it could be transformative.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

If you’re unfamiliar with the Met Gala, it’s an annual event that raises funding for the museum’s Costume Institute by encouraging the rich and famous to wear outrageous, themed costumes in a world-class menagerie of peacocking. We’re talking single-use fashion but make at six figures.This year’s theme is “In America: An Anthology of Fashion,” which follows last year’s “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” as a two-part series that focuses on the storied history of American fashion. That’s despite the fact that the United States has been around for less than 250 years, and spent much of that time importing fashion from France and England.Queen of meatpacking pic.twitter.com/5I0r600RA9But perhaps the Met Gala felt the need to simplify things a little bit after the gala’s 2019 theme “What is Camp?” was met with a resounding sense that no one was really sure what it meant. But even the “In America” theme leaves plenty of room for controversy. Who can forget Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s dress from last year, emblazoned with “TAX THE RICH” and dripping with irony? According to reporting by the New York Times, designers and corporate sponsors generally cover the event’s $35,000 a ticket (or $200,000 to $300,000 for a table) for the gala’s guests, while NYC elected officials are special guests of the museum and do not pay to attend.“In America: An Anthology of Fashion traces the emergence of a distinct American style, revealing underlying stories that often go unrecognized,” said Max Hollein, the Met’s director, in a statement. “As a whole, this ambitious two-part exhibition ignites timely conversations about the tremendous cultural contributions of designers working in the United States and the very definition of an American aesthetic.”The evening’s official co-chairs are Hollywood stars Regina King, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. They will host an evening that features the second installment of the exhibition series, displaying approximately 100 fashion items dating from the 19th to the mid-to-late 20th-century. The garments will be presented throughout the Met’s American Wing period rooms, placing them in the context of more than a century of American domestic life, in an attempt to frame an “identifiable American style.” I’m imagining blue jeans.The exhibition will also be punctuated by eight fictional cinematic vignettes, or “freeze frames,” within each room, created by filmmakers Janicza Bravo, Sofia Coppola, Julie Dash, Tom Ford, Martin Scorsese, Autumn de Wilde, Chloé Zhao, and King. Drawing a connection between fashion and Hollywood certainly underscores the incredible impact of movie-making on fashion as a cultural beacon.Those with a hankering for fashion and celebrity will surely be tuning in to see all the hottest “lewks” being served up by the glitterati. Our eyes will especially be peeled for statement pieces in which famous people try to make the current state of world crisis somehow all about them. It will be a season to remember! You know, until the next one!Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Ukraine Asks to Keep Measures to Protect Cultural Heritage Under Wraps</title>

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy Kateryna Chuhuieva has urged journalists and activists against disseminating information about efforts to protect cultural heritage properties in the country out of fear of exposing them as targets for Russian troops and opportunists. “We ask journalists and activists not to share information about current protection measures, imposed by museums and local residents, the location of these goods, and the places for their relocation during the war,” Chuhuieva said during a briefing on Thursday, March 17. “Publication or sending such data to unknown individuals and unchecked organizations might endanger people as well as museum exhibits.”Objects of immense cultural significance “can become attractive targets for both the enemy and looters and thieves,” the deputy minister explained. She also said that Ukrainian officials were working with UNESCO to distinguish cultural heritage sites with the Blue Shield emblem to afford them with enhanced protection status. If such sites are granted this status, their destruction would constitute evidence of a war crime. Attacks in Ukraine have already decimated several churches, and many Ukrainians are scrambling to evacuate treasured artifacts that are at high risk of destruction in future strikes. Earlier this week, on March 16, a theater in the eastern port city of Mariupol that sheltered at least 1,000 civilians was bombed by Russian forces; it remains unclear how many were killed in the attack. A museum in the town of Ivankiv near Kyiv, housing a number of works by the artist Maria Pryimachenko, was bombed on February 28. Many Ukrainians see such callous neglect of its heritage as part and parcel of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nationalistic campaign to deny Ukraine of its cultural specificity, and hence sovereignty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has contended that the Kremlin is intent on the “erasure” of Ukraine as an independent sovereign state.With the prospect of a coordinated assault on Ukrainian cultural treasures on the horizon, civilian documentation of the destruction of cultural heritage is encouraged. Despite its cautionary statement on broadcasting information on efforts to salvage Ukrainian heritage properties, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy recently rolled out a website where those who have witnessed cultural crimes across Ukraine are asked to submit photo and video evidence. Lazare Eloundou, head of Unesco’s World Heritage Centre, reported that the agency was increasingly receiving reports about the destruction of cultural heritage in several cities, and that its officials were working closely with local cultural professionals to develop an “action plan.” Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Brazilian Modernist Building Engulfed by Fire Receives Getty Preservation Grant</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 534  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/1045_202252847_6_2000x2000.jpg?fit=720%2C534 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure The $240,000 grant will help preserve 38,500 surviving objects pertaining to Brazil’s rich architectural history.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents In April last year, a fire at the College City campus of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro set the second floor of a modernist building ablaze. That building, designed by Jorge Machado Moreira, housed the University of Architecture and Urbanism, whose Research and Documentation Center — or Núcleo de Pesquisa e Documentação (NPD) — contained archival equipment like cameras, scanners, and computers. It also held over 50,000 documents and 5,000 photographs recording more than 150 years of Brazilian architectural history. The papers included those associated with Brazilian modernist architects such as Lúcio Costa, Affonso Eduardo Reidy, Roberto Burle Marx, and Moreira himself, as well as Europeans like Le Corbusier.Earlier this month, the Getty Foundation granted $240,000 to the NPD to restore the archives damaged by the fire, which started in an air-conditioning unit. Founded in 1982, the NPD was established with the purpose of collecting documents important to the architectural history of Brazil.“These collections are considered the most important architectural archives of modern Brazil’s Carioca School, so the conservation and long-term care of these priceless items is our highest priority,” Andrés Martín Passaro, an NPD coordinator, said in a statement. The Escola Carioca, a group of architects active from 1930 to 1960, drew inspiration from modernists like Le Corbusier while hybridizing that style with Luso-Brazilian elements. For 18 months, a team of conservators and an archivist will work with students in the Conservation and Restoration department at the Escola de Belas Artes and the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism to restore the collections. This will involve preventative measures like situating them in a new temperature-stabilized environment, while assessing the condition of what remains and keeping up-to-date records on a database. Students and staff will also be trained in best practices for the conservation of the roughly 38,500 objects that survive.“While soot and water permanently harmed a significant number of items and the Center is now unusable, we can take comfort in knowing the bulk of our collection will be given a new home with suitable environmental conditions,” Passaro continued.In recent years, preventable blazes at Brazil’s museums and cultural institutions have occurred with upsetting regularity. In 2018, a fire at Brazil’s National Museum eviscerated 90% of its collection, destroying one of the largest museums of natural history and anthropology in the Americas overnight. Among the many artifacts damaged were “Luzia,” the oldest human fossil in the Americas, and the most extensive Egyptian collection in the Americas. In July 2021, a fire enveloped the Cinemateca Brasileira, Brazil’s foremost archive for film and television — an inevitability that many had apprehensively predicted given deep budget cuts and an observable pattern of negligence toward arts and culture under the governing regime.The grant is the latest one in Getty’s Keeping it Modern initiative, which supports conservation efforts for modernist buildings worldwide. The conservation of the site of the NPD is important not only because it represents a significant building preservation in its own right. Its materials are additionally critical to preservation professionals, who “rely on collections like these to care for modern buildings,” São Paulo-based preservation architect Silvio Oksman said in the statement. Getty indicated in a press release that it is currently doing conservation work on 77 sites, a majority of which “involve the development of conservation management plans that draw heavily on archival materials such as those housed in the Jorge Machado Moreira building.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Laurie Cumbo, Criticized as Anti-Immigrant, Will Be NYC’s Next Cultural Affairs Commissioner</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 420  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/laurie.jpg?fit=720%2C420 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure The incoming culture commissioner vocally opposed legislation that grants noncitizens in the city the right to vote, among other controversies.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Laurie Cumbo, the former majority leader of the New York City Council who has been criticized for what some view as an anti-immigrant stance, will be the next commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA), the agency announced today, March 18. Cumbo will succeed Gonzalo Casals, who stepped down at the end of Bill de Blasio’s mayoral term in 2021 and joined the Mellon Foundation as a senior research and policy fellow.Last December, Cumbo voiced opposition to legislation that allows nearly one million noncitizens living in New York to vote in municipal elections, arguing that it would “shift the power dynamics” in the city to the disadvantage of its Black residents.“We do not have the numbers or the information to know how that is going to impact African-American communities who have been the most vulnerable in our existence in our city,” Cumbo told Politico. “Laurie Cumbo has a recent record of anti-immigrant statements   policy positions. Her appointment is another deeply troubling sign that @NYCMayor is choosing intolerant political loyalists instead of listening to our communities.” -Our @NatyAristiBetahttps://t.co/FEavbenhO6The comment drew ire from supporters of the legislation and immigration advocates including Luis Miranda, a political strategist and father of award-winning composer and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. “I am sorry but Ms. Cumbo’s recent anti-immigrant statements make it very difficult for me to support her appointment,” Luis Miranda wrote in an email to members of Mayor Eric Adams’s transition committee in January, when there was first talk of Cumbo being named commissioner.“Her appointment is another deeply troubling sign that @NYCMayor is choosing intolerant political loyalists instead of listening to our communities,” said Natalia Aristizabal, the deputy director of the immigration advocacy group Make the Road New York, in a tweet shared by the organization.Cumbo is a longtime and fervent supporter of Adams, who has defended her potential nomination. “Laurie’s a superstar, and I love Laurie,” he told Politico in January. Born and raised in Brooklyn, Cumbo earned an undergraduate degree in Art History from Spelman College and an MA in Visual Arts Administration from New York University. A member of the city council from 2014 to 2021 representing its 35th district ⁠— which covers several Brooklyn neighborhoods including Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill ⁠— Cumbo also founded the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts in Fort Greene in 1999. In 2017, Cumbo successfully sponsored a legislative package that increased funding for the Percent for Art program, a public art initiative administered by the DCLA. At the time, it was the largest package of bills in the history of the agency. She also supported and passed legislation to create the first-ever citywide Minority and Women-Owned Businesses Task Force. In a press release shared by DCLA today, several leaders of cultural institutions across the city, including the Laundromat Project and the Brooklyn Arts Council, praised the former councilwoman and welcomed the appointment.“Laurie Cumbo has been a tireless advocate for arts and culture organizations and, more particularly, organizations led by people of color,” said Melody Capote, executive director of the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute.But critics of Cumbo cite her record of culturally insensitive and polarizing statements that appear to pit ethnic groups against one another. In 2013, she apologized for writing in a Facebook post that “the accomplishments of the Jewish community triggers feelings of resentment” among her constituents. The comment was made in the wake of a series of attacks on Jewish residents of Crown Heights and was interpreted by many as anti-Semitic. In 2015, Cumbo also apologized for expressing concerns over “blocs” of Asian Americans moving into public housing in her district during a council hearing.At the height of Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, Cumbo, who is Black, compared calls to defund the police to “colonization” and said the movement was led primarily by White progressives.The DCLA is the largest cultural funding agency in the United States, providing hundreds of millions of dollars to more than 1,000 arts and culture nonprofits across all five boroughs of New York City.“I thank Mayor Eric Adams for appointing me to this position. Together, we will center the arts in New York’s economic recovery and bolster the educational and cultural experiences of every New York City student from Pre-K to CUNY,” Cumbo said in the DCLA’s statement. Echoing Adams’s tough-on-crime rhetoric, she added: “I also believe we can help address public safety issues in New York City — taking a gun out of the hands of a young person and replacing it with an instrument, paintbrush, camera, or script will redirect the talent and passions of our youth towards building a better and more vibrant New York City.” Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>A Hogarth Survey Has Good Intentions but Misses the Mark</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 547  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/William-Hogarth-A-Scene-from-The-Beggars-Opera-VI.jpg?fit=720%2C547 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Why assemble the most significant grouping of Hogarths from far and wide without indicating why calling out the faults in historical artworks is important to our understanding of our world today?</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents LONDON — William Hogarth is best known for his moralizing satires of British pretension, such as his painting sequences A Rake’s Progress (1732–34) or Marriage a la Mode (1743), and for his xenophobic nationalism as exhibited, for example, by grotesque depictions of the French in “The Gate of Calais” (1843). The press for Tate Britain’s show Hogarth and Europe initially intrigues by promising to look at him in context with his European counterparts for the first time, “[exploring] the parallels and exchanges that crossed borders and the cosmopolitan character of [his] art.” While contemporary Britain is feeling the economic pinch from Brexit turmoil, this statement from curators Alice Insley and Martin Myrone sounds like a canny echo of pro-European Union sentiments.However, a different topical issue emerges as the primary reason for contextualizing Hogarth and Europe — that of societal inequality, racism, sexism, and colonialism. UK institutions are increasingly looking inward to examine their colonial pasts and links to slavery. Museum officials are rethinking ways to present the visual content of their collections, much of which perpetuates outdated and, at times, condemnable societal attitudes, and commissioning reports to identify where institutions have benefited from colonialism and slavery. In this spirit, we are invited to consider Hogarth’s period of Enlightenment during the 18th century as having ideals “produced by, and [which] benefited, white men from the middle and upper classes. The concept of European superiority deepened, entrenching ideas about nation, personal identity, and racial difference, manifested in the horrors of transatlantic slavery.”It is unfortunate, then, that a heavy-handed approach to this project, combined with a lack of focus, sorely undermines the curators’ honorable intentions. This is the first exhibition I have seen in which the lead curators write the main wall captions, but an additional group of “commentators” has been formed to lend “perspective and expertise” in smaller captions. These include various art historians, artists, and conservationists, as well as the Museum Detox Interpretation Group, a body composed of people of color who work in museums and heritage and who seek to champion diversity in the arts. At best, the additional commentary is insightful and provides jumping off points for discussion, or highlights the significance of minor characters who are peripheral in the compositions. Issues arise, however, when it becomes too speculative — for instance, imagining the thoughts of marginalized figures in the artworks (often people of color) — or forces the agenda beyond provability. Next to Hogarth’s “The Distressed Poet” (1733-35), for example, is a caption by Lars Tharp that homes in on the presence of porcelain and tea imported from Asia (specifically a red teapot that is “probably Chinese”), all of which are almost impossible to make out in the image itself — other visitors I noticed also struggled to find these items. This reading ignores the main focus, which is a poet slumped over his latest work in a decrepit bedsit, neglecting his family, and the presence of a milkmaid demanding an unpaid bill, in favor of barely visible tropes of colonialist expansion in tea and porcelain. Other details, such as a cupboard empty save for a mouse, and a dog stealing food from the family’s plate, clearly emphasize the primary satirical focus on the social and romantic pretensions of the aspiring poet at the expense of feeding his family and paying those who serve him.It is actually a curious paradox that because the curators seek to find commonalities between Hogarth and his European contemporaries with the purpose of highlighting societal inequality, as well as exploitation and privilege resulting from slavery across the board, the exhibition might as well not be about Hogarth at all. This is unfortunate, as it is the most comprehensive collection of his art likely to be assembled for years to come; it includes 60 works, among them private loans and pieces from the US, notably the gorgeous portrait of “Miss Mary Edwards” (1742) from the Frick in New York. The last room is filled with many portraits examining a trend toward depicting greater humanity in wealthy sitters, yet the question of inequality is again forced with this opaque explanation: “Sometimes, where these images suggest subjectivities rejected or compromised by the dominant ideas about race, class and gender, they hint at the unfulfilled promises and contradictions of modern European society.” A valid point is hovering around in this ambiguous language, but the dense academic prose seems to sidestep direct address of wealth and privilege. Yet what most complicates the attempt to both unify Hogarth and European artists and highlight outdated depictions is the question of satire, and how he used it. Take “Southwark Fair” (1733), which depicts a fair that was held around Borough High Street every year until its abolition in 1762, and was often a scene of violence and impropriety. It is crammed with innumerable details of cartoonish figures engaged in revelry; on the far right a stage collapses under the weight of actors in a moment of chaos. Among the crowd are figures watching a peepshow, a dwarf playing bagpipes, and, in a clear indication of society gone topsy-turvy, a dog dressed as a gentleman and walking on its hind legs. It is demonstrably a wry condemnation of polite society breaking down with the excuse of a festival. Adjacent to the dog is a Black man playing a trumpet. The curators’ caption posits a deliberate parallel between the dog dressed as a gentleman and the trumpeter, indicating that while “mocking social class” it nonetheless “signals deepening ideas of racial difference pervasive in 18th Century culture.” There is no further comment given to support this reading, so it remains more a suggested interpretation than an overwhelmingly convincing example of outright racism within Hogarth’s work. As the curators have centered inequality in 18th-century European society throughout the survey, satire promises a more productive way into the subject than simply looking out for evidence of colonialist tropes such as tea and porcelain or tobacco, coffee, and sugar — “[latent] elements of exploitation and subjection” — in Hogarth’s “A Midnight Modern Conversation” (shown at the Tate in a copy after the lost original). This is not to deny the recognition of such items as evidencing horrific exploitation in their production, but focusing on such items threatens to sideline the potential for a more complex discussion. (Ironically, the attention to satire highlights how distinct Hogarth is from his European contemporaries, whose works on view never achieve his capacity for nuanced satire.)Far from simply recording things as they appeared, Hogarth’s exaggerated compositions and other satirical elements are active commentaries meant to provoke thought. The introductory text says the works shown “express a critical view of society, but they also reveal the entrenchment of racist, sexist, and xenophobic stereotypes. Artists may have celebrated individuality, but they also made representations of people that are disturbing or dehumanising.” Within Hogarth it is this tangling of the exaggerated grotesquery of satire and the recording of figures informed by entrenched racist perceptions of the time that problematizes any straightforward interpretation of his images.The section on “A Modern Midnight Conversation” questions whether this image of white men falling about dunk, in various versions with Black slaves in attendance, is a moralizing condemnation of vice and the material mores of a society benefiting from slavery, or actually a gentle and affectionate ribbing of the behaviors of this strata of society, in which Hogarth was trying to ingratiate himself. In this instance we may see Hogarth as complicit in perpetuating colonialist stereotypes of slavery and oppression.If the overarching aim of this show is, as it seems, to uncover and belatedly condemn the racist elements of these artworks, it misses an important point. Yes, much of the art contains unacceptable imagery as it reflects social and racial hierarchies of the time. But why assemble the most significant grouping of Hogarths from far and wide simply to sweep it wholesale into this bucket, without indicating why calling out the faults in historical artworks is important to our understanding of our world today? Or, likewise, discussing the ambiguity of satire, which allows the artist to position himself as an external critic and be complicit in the critiqued acts. This same positional ambiguity enables much ingrained racism and white privilege still. It is a fact that social systems, and thus daily lives, in the UK and abroad are shaped by the horrors of slavery and colonialism, but in seeking out and condemning artifacts from the past the curators of this and similarly themed exhibitions risk historicizing racism. Rather, we should relate it to today’s very real and still entrenched racism and sexism. In short, what can we learn from these artworks if we hold them up as mirrors?It is never a pleasure to address curatorial missteps when an exhibition has at its center a very urgent and honorable desire to condemn outdated racist views and stereotypes. Despite its shortcomings and sometimes muddled delivery, we should nonetheless admire the curators’ effort to reevaluate Hogarth whom, for a long while, has received a free pass under the all-forgiving umbrella of “satire.” One of British art’s most revered eccentric characters should not be exempt from criticism and the curators should be credited for creating a conversation around the issue in the first place. An important takeaway from the show is the encouragement more than ever to consider the societal and historical context in which art is made; in short, not to simply take its message at face value, which is a core principle of investigative art history.Hogarth and Europe continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through March 20.

		<title>The Deeply Satisfying Pleasures of Harriet Korman’s Paintings</title>

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents You don’t need to use a lot of colors to be a great colorist. This became obvious when I saw the exhibition Harriet Korman: New Work at Thomas Erben Gallery (February 24–April 9, 2022), her fourth with the gallery. To further define the singularity of Korman’s achievement, in contrast to many other abstract artists of her generation (she was born in the 1940s) who have been in pursuit of color, she does not nod to pop culture in her color choices, nor does she have a signature structure into which she drops her hues. Rather, she works in distinct series without any ostensible subject matter. As a consequence, she has not developed either a signature style or palette, those conventional access points the art world seems to crave. She wants the viewer to have a more direct and open encounter with her work, which is a seldom-traveled road these days. As Korman states in the gallery press release:In this current series, I drew to find a form I wanted to work with. These drawings are not studies, I consider drawing to be an equal practice to painting and value them as such. While drawing, I chose a very simple, familiar form of concentric rectangles because it seemed like it would be an interesting challenge. I took that form into painting without referring to the drawings, and later used the drawings as sources for the paintings.Later, she adds:I try to capture the dynamic in the drawings; the color relationships, the proportions, the movement — what attracts me in the drawing, not copy it. This interpolation has many obstacles, pitfalls, inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies, but ultimately is very engaging.Korman’s interest in proportion and movement are key to the dynamic relationships that she articulates in the recent paintings. While the paintings share the formal element of concentric rectangles there is nothing formulaic about what she does; each painting comes across as distinct, hard earned, and, at times, it seems almost rudimentary. Many artists who explore color and geometry produce variations on a form or a palette, but this is never the case with Korman. You might think that she would settle into habits but she never does. I cannot stress how fresh and exciting this is. For one thing, each painting comes across as individual and specific, rather than as a variation on a pre-established form or another fill-in-the-colors version of geometric abstraction. By designating each work as “untitled,” she shortens the distance between the viewer and the art by avoiding any detours through language and its attendant associations.  The freshness of these paintings is a result of Korman starting with oil stick drawings, which are meant to stand on their own, and do. In the drawings, she proceeds improvisationally: each color rectangle and the space it takes up determines what happens next. The width of the framing rectangles is markedly different and follows no pattern. The drawings work incrementally, in a process of adding without erasing or covering over one color with another that has its roots in Jackson Pollock and his poured paintings. Each drawing becomes a possible structure to explore. The shift from oil stick drawing to oil painting, as well as the change in scale, evokes the legendary jazz pianist Art Tatum improvising Vincent Youmans’s “Tea for Two.” While respecting the original song, he makes it into something all his own. When the drawings and paintings are in close proximity, it becomes apparent how much Korman has transformed one thing into another, always while respecting the nature of her materials, the porous density of the oil stick, and the smooth solidity of the oil paint. At the same time, there are a number of artists working this way — in which color calls to color — but I can’t think of anyone as sensitive to the internal dynamics of proportion and density, and of the weight of one color against another, as Korman. These concerns, and her ability to trust her decisions without going back into the work, as if a perfect resolution existed, are why these paintings never become formulaic. Look at the ones on the gallery’s longest wall and you will see that the proportions within the paintings’ rectangles change and she does not work on an equally sized format: she is not programming her work according to consumers’ desire for dependability. In recent years Korman has worked with saturated colors, so her use of browns and chartreuse signal something new in her work. In the case of brown, she uses it as a neutral (neither warm nor cool), causing the other colors to gain in strength, or places two different tones in close proximity. In fact, while I was scrutinizing the paintings, both up close and from a distance, I realized that I kept doing something that I rarely do in an exhibition. I repeatedly stood back and gazed at a group of paintings, seeing what they shared and what distinguished them, and taking particular notice of how the density of the colors changed from work to work. It is so easy to overlook this crucial difference between Korman’s art and that of other artists who, for example, work within a grid structure. Korman’s geometric abstractions make those of other artists seem flabby. With many geometric abstract artists the similarities among their paintings far outweigh the differences. That this never happens with Korman’s paintings should clue you into what is remarkable about them — for which she should receive more recognition. Each painting possesses a quietly unique identity. When she uses two yellows in a painting, as in “Untitled” (2021, oil on canvas, 48 by 60 inches), they are not the same, but it’s the colors between them, and the width of each separating band, that makes their difference visually momentous. Walter Pater famously said, “All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.” Korman’s paintings exist in a musical state; they compose an intuitively orchestrated set of optical vibrations that synthesize contrast and tonal shifts, large and small intervals, by underscoring difference. She brings together different clusters and tones, some sharply contrasting and other tonally shifting. Sometimes the interval between related tones is marked by contrasting colors. And even within the internal configuration Korman will do something unexpected, such as frame the contrasting color with a wide and a very narrow band. The overall effect is that a viewer is continuously pulled into the paintings, and will begin to notice the internal harmonies and dissonances, and how they fit together without becoming subsumed into an overarching pattern. At one point, I limited my focus to the edges of the concentric rectangle, and how some were curved, which made the concentric planes appear as if they were billowing. Then I began accounting for all that was not a concentric rectangle: a floating, diagonal, yellow-orange brushstroke within the deep orange rectangle in the center of the painting, a brown line within the narrow, red, centered lozenge-like rectangle. We are not meant to see Korman’s paintings all at once. The kind of looking her paintings and drawings demand, and should receive, is slow. As we become more attuned to her decisions, we may realize that we cannot ascribe any other motivation than the pursuit of a unique color sensation. It is a harder goal to achieve than one might think, and Korman is one of the few who has never made a signature form, or developed a market-driven aesthetic, within that domain. Harriet Korman: New Work continues at Thomas Erben Gallery (526 West 26th Street, floor 4, Chelsea, Manhattan) through April 9.

		<title>David Byrne’s Hopeful Drawings</title>

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents The lesson embedded in Pace Gallery’s How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic, an exhibition of David Byrne’s art, is spelled out in a wall-sized artist statement at its entrance. For visitors who can still catch this breezy, trippy show before it wraps up its six-week-long run this Saturday, figuring out the title’s significance from the works themselves can be more rewarding than relying on the autobiographical explanation. Byrne’s nattily sketched word associations, surreal cartoons, and thought diagrams — also collected in A History of the World (in Dingbats) Drawings and Writings David Byrne (Phaidon Press 2022) — nod to art making as high-spirited brainstorming and insightful deviations. The fact that mental detours serve as this show’s unifying theme will be no surprise to any visitor with passing knowledge of Byrne’s multimedia career. Like the drawings and writings at Pace, Byrne’s output has involved creative sleights of hand that only appear effortless due to decades of savvy refinement. From his days as a two-time art college dropout turned frontman and chief songwriter for the punk-era juggernaut the Talking Heads to his current Broadway turn deconstructing the pop concert into postmillennial musical theater through the stripped down, gymnastic choreography of American Utopia, Byrne exploits our country’s homegrown conventions. His subject matter ranges from advertising bromides to self-help talk to religious fundamentalist exhortations, their languages reframed into funkier, more skewed grooves and configurations that — like these spur-of-the-moment drawings and pictographs — make America’s delusional optimism seem credible again. Byrne’s public reputation for proposing counterintuitive hopefulness provides another subtext in How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic. Although he enjoys a celebrity’s comfortable perch in gentrified New York, the artist has publicly inveighed, insightfully and determinedly, against the city’s ongoing encrustation in Midas gold. In response, less famous and well-connected fellow artists — including some in this publication — have charged him with ignoring creative communities and cultural initiatives thriving beyond Gotham’s gilded zip codes. But living in the glass house of an elite Manhattan gallery, as Byrne does, doesn’t mean you can’t throw rhetorical stones at the creepy commodification of nearly every facet of daily American life, provided you aim those objections at the right agents.That’s not to say this exhibition is political. It isn’t. But there’s more than a winking nod to the inbuilt contradiction in showing unassuming drawings and writings — most made spontaneously by Byrne with a mere pen or pencil on archival paper — in an elite art gallery with global outposts. Set directly across from the ostentatious Chelsea skyline visible through the gallery’s 7th-floor skylights and ceiling-to-floor windows, Byrne’s small-scaled and spare drawings — many dating from the city’s grueling lockdown period in 2020 — may remind us (and maybe reminded the artist as well) that art can be created wherever you find yourself entombed, and by using whatever tools you have in that bunker.So, is Byrne’s art any good? Stylistically, the best drawings and most interesting verbal pictographs land somewhere between the interrogative visual adventures in Saul Steinberg’s virtuosic drawings and the sometimes overhyped calisthenics of Keith Haring’s charming silhouettes. As the exhibition spotlights the most rudimentary level of Byrne’s visual repertoire, it’s akin to observing, in any given city or small town, a daydreaming bus passenger with pen in hand, drawing or scribbling excitedly in a moleskin notebook. So the “non-rational logic” to which Byrne alludes is the fertile mindlessness that goes into making art on an everyday basis. And so Byrne shows that the pen has reasons that reason can never know. A still-life doodle of a woolen winter cap can metamorphose hairy human limbs and look ready to take a winter’s walk. A self-assured pigeon gazing into its wardrobe mirror can see its neurotic human double staring back with reciprocal envy or admiration for what they both almost are, or aren’t. Visual engimas like these play out through the drawings’ consistently disarming humor. What causes the agony in Byrne’s Mr. Potato Head as he grimaces and rears backward on skinny avian legs? Is the giant finger reaching down for a pill-sized smart phone that of a postmodern Gulliver, texted by Lilliputians who miss his company? Some of the works that include writing — especially the wall-sized mural that dominates the exhibition space — represent Byrne scattering and then rearranging cultural code words and familial or social labels. One drawing shows that a cocktail bar’s taxonomies can be as intellectually productive as a chemist’s periodic table. Other word associations are set within the roots and branches of trees to reveal how pre-given categories can, without much conscious thought, outgrow or uproot former hierarchies; still other pictorial lists show how the subconscious mind classifies and distorts markers of human progress or worldly success. Stop making sense, Byrne famously sings in the Talking Heads’ underground dance hit “Girlfriend Is Better” (1982). And in the American decades since Byrne first plied his musical trade in New York’s squalid Lower East Side clubs — in a far more egalitarian economy than ours and in a city that then had an undeniably more diverse, de-institutionalized artistic ecosystem — the willfully ignorant among us have increasingly seized power by denying empirical facts while claiming to be most enlightened, turning rationality ever more on its aching head.  So this lightheartedness is a tonic for our times even as the exhibition poses a serious question: Can the simplest gestures in art and writing revive optimism amid the dangerous nonsense and simplifications that pass for cultural and intellectual exchanges these days? In the liner notes to his album American Utopia (2018) Byrne, in the pre-pandemic Trump-era, comes close to eulogizing that American tradition of hope, before returning to the premise that “to be descriptive is to be prescriptive.” If you unpack that sentiment further in light of these drawings and writings, it’s less a naïve platitude than it sounds. And it makes me wonder what else art is for, but to remind us that what we call “being reasonable” is too often our expedient alibi for not using our imagination.David Byrne: How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic continues at Pace Gallery (540 West 25th Street, Chelsea, Manhattan) through March 19.

		<title>In San Marcos, A Homecoming for Bill Hutson</title>

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Over the past six decades, Bill Hutson has exhibited his multifaceted artwork nationally and internationally, but has never shown it in his hometown. Hutson grew up in the strictly segregated city of San Marcos, Texas in the 1930s and ’40s, where art was one of many things that were off limits to non-White citizens. “I was born and raised in an environment where there were no incentives that would lead me to visual [or] fine arts,” Hutson told Hyperallergic in a recent email. “If there was a gallery, museum or visual art venue,” he explained, “I would not have had access to it as non-white people in that town at that time could not have gone to such places without going there to either clean the bathroom, wash the windows or mop the floor.” The Art of Bill Hutson in San Marcos is a long overdue, city-wide tribute to the artist’s innovative work, and his will to overcome challenges despite great odds. Curated and organized by Margo Handwerker, the Chief Curator and Director of the Texas State Galleries at Texas State University, and Linda Kelsey-Jones, the university’s Community Arts Coordinator, Hutson’s first exhibition in Texas presents more than 60 works across five venues, including The Calaboose African American History Museum, The Price Center, The San Marcos Art Center, Texas State Galleries, and Walkers’ Gallery at the San Marcos Public Library. The exhibition offers viewers a rare chance to survey Hutson’s prolific and varied output. It’s also a frank and sincere gesture towards reconsidering the city’s relationship to its own history with regards to race.Hutson was born in San Marcos in 1936. His father died when the artist was only five, so he and his siblings took on agricultural and construction jobs in addition to their school work to help out. The young Hutson found visual inspiration nearby. “I was attracted to cartoons as our house, a shotgun house, had wallpaper that was actually newspaper,” Hutson said by email. “In this way all during my childhood I saw cartoons and sometimes I would draw and copy them.” Hutson saw his first painting on the campus of Texas State University, where he helped his mother at her job as a custodial worker. Still, Huston told Hyperallergic, “I was nearly an adult before I became aware of fine art.”The turn to artmaking came after Hutson had finished high school and served in the US Air Force. He moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s, where he attended an art school and worked as a studio assistant to the artist Frank N. Ashley. In 1963, Hutson moved to New York City, where he joined the vibrant art scenes of SoHo and Midtown Manhattan. Over the next 40 years, the artist lived and exhibited between the US, Europe, and Africa. Hutson now lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where his art and archives are housed in the permanent collection of the Phillips Museum at Franklin   Marshall College.The cornerstone piece of the city-wide presentation is “Homestead with signs, symbols and numbers” (1979-1990), a roughly seven- by nine-foot canvas at Texas State Galleries. Crucially, Handwerker has included two preparatory sketches for the work, as well as the artist’s model of his childhood home. Each of these elements helps the viewer to decode Hutson’s complex constellation of signs that stand for the racial topography of the San Marcos of his youth, where African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans were prohibited from visiting downtown, using most public facilities, and frequently threatened with violence. In one drawing, for example, we see Hutson exploring themes of ownership, belonging, and space as he writes the names of local indigenous populations who have inhabited the region for centuries. He later references these groups in an abstracted painted teepee.The work is also technically layered. Hutson’s thick, swirling passages of acrylic paint are carefully bound by sharp, angular edges. His shapes float over a textured green background treated with the artist’s “bind-stain-release-flatten” technique, in which the canvas is condensed, dyed, and then stretched onto a frame. The method appears in several of Hutson’s other pieces, along with sewing, 3D elements, and other interventions that alter the very fabric and structure of the work itself. Here Hutson seems to be challenging painting as a surface and concept. Other works are made up of moveable, modular components that can be configured freely.Ultimately, the piece embodies what Hutson calls the “tragic paradox of ‘home,” where a point of origin is also a place of, in the artist’s words, “oppression, bondage and insecurity.” This complicated ambivalence makes this homecoming all the more important.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents This kind of cluttered onslaught of homogenous e-commerce options is what recently prompted Dmitri Brereton, a twenty-six-year-old engineer at a recruiting-software company in San Francisco, to publish a blog post titled “Google Search Is Dying.” When it comes to product reviews or recipes, Brereton argued, results from Google’s search engine “have gone to shit.” Rather than settling for the default, those who want to know what a “genuine real-life human being” thinks of a certain product have learned work-arounds, such as adding “Reddit” to their searches to bring up relevant threads on that platform. On Reddit’s “Buy It for Life” forum, for instance, they’ll find users showing off a Soviet-era toaster, a restored vintage Sunbeam, and other toasters to “grow old with,” as one put it. Brereton’s post–which ended “Google is dead. Long live Google + ‘site:reddit.com’ ”—became the No. 10 most upvoted link ever on the tech-industry discussion board Hacker News. No. 11 is a complaint about Google’s search results looking too similar to its ads, while No. 12 is a link to an alternative, indie search engine. Clearly, others share Brereton’s sense of search-engine discontentment.Sportswashing is the practice of laundering one’s reputation through sports; whether that be through team ownership, hosting a major tournament, or sponsorship. A country or politician gets involved with the hope that some of the sport’s popularity will improve their image.As the world’s most popular sport, soccer is an effective vehicle for sportswashing. Saudi Arabia recently purchased English Premier League team Newcastle United. Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was trying to sell London’s Chelsea F.C. before the British government sanctioned him.When the British entered the Benin Oba (King’s) palace, they found “several hundred unique bronze plaques, suggestive of almost Egyptian design, but of really superb casting,” according to Reginald Bacon, an intelligence officer with the expedition. Soldiers walked out with the plaques, along with other art, ivory, brass, jewelry and garments. Thousands of pieces were taken.They were “not just loot, they were blood art,” Australian journalist Marc Fennell explained on the podcast “Stuff the British Stole.” Indeed, word was sent back to Britain that selling off Benin’s objects could help offset the cost of the war.In New York City, the police commissioner can and often does choose to ignore the results of CCRB-brought disciplinary trials. The commissioner can ignore guilty pleas and can even decide there should be no trial at all, as appears to be happening in this case. Last year, the police commissioner followed through on the CCRB’s discipline recommendations in serious cases just 27% of the time.I sent the NYPD a series of questions, asking both about its power to ignore the CCRB and about how that power has been wielded in this case. I got a one-sentence response: “The disciplinary process is ongoing.”We do know something about what’s happened to the officers, and about their records. Thanks to legislation that New York state passed in the summer of 2020, police records are no longer secret. The CCRB’s report names the officers involved.Trump’s rise largely coincided with a push and pull over American exceptionalism that has now outlasted his presidency. Sides are not clean, are not divided by party or political orientation. The debate concerns not just what the United States is and can be, but in fact what this or any country can represent to its citizens and to the world. On the one hand are the exceptionalists—those who hold faith in an America that is unique in the world and destined for greatness. Opposing the exceptionalists are a motley crew spread across right, left, and center who argue that America is, even beyond Trump’s relatively amoral formulation, a force for ill. Let’s call this inchoate ideology counter-exceptionalism. It’s not anti-exceptionalist—that is, it is not simply an argument against American exceptionalism. Rather, it is an argument affirming exceptionalism’s inverse: an ideology that argues that America either has always been, or has become, a unique force for ill in the world.Counter-exceptionalism has crept into our public spaces en masse—and it is a force that threatens the political and cultural integrity both of the country as a whole and, in the more immediate term, of the ideological battles of those engaged in an earnest debate about how to better it. A left that cannot conceive of an America that has even the potential to be a force for good now struggles to make a positive argument for that good and concedes the grounds of hope and reconciliation to the exceptionalist right. The counter-exceptionalist right, meanwhile, has grown convinced of American decadence and decline—it believes that the United States has become a sort of Sodom, and in that conviction has become increasingly hostile to democracy and amenable to violence as a legitimate political mechanism.In the first part of the finale on Monday, Clayton second-guessed everything and broke down in tears as he mourned Susie’s departure. For some reason, this inspired him to be “transparent” with Rachel and Gabby, who were waiting for him at the rose ceremony, since he was supposed to be narrowing the final three down to the final two. In what host Jesse Palmer excitedly called the “rose ceremony from hell,” Clayton informed Rachel and Gabby that Susie left, and it had “shattered” him: “I was in love with her. … I am in love with both of you. And I also was intimate with both of you.” He admitted he had no idea whom to choose, and soon, the only sounds that could be heard were those of both Rachel and Gabby sobbing as they ran off in separate directions.Somehow (a producer’s encouragement?), Clayton was able to cajole Rachel and Gabby to stick around and even meet his family, who had traveled to Iceland to meet his final two. Everyone pretended not to be miserable, especially Clayton, though afterward he did the worst thing: After putting everyone through that forced happiness, he realized the person he really loved was Susie.During one recent news bulletin on BBC Radio 4, the correspondent referred to “Putin’s baseless claim that the Ukrainian state supports Nazis”. This is, itself, disinformation: it is an observable fact, which the BBC itself has previously reported on accurately and well, that the Ukrainian state has, since 2014, provided funding, weapons and other forms of support to extreme Right-wing militias, including neo-Nazi ones. This is not a new or controversial observation. Back in 2019, I spent time in Ukraine interviewing senior figures in the constellation of state-backed extreme Right-wing groups for Harper’s magazine; they were all quite open about their ideology and plans for the future. Indeed, some of the best coverage of Ukraine’s extreme Right-wing groups has come from the open-source intelligence outlet Bellingcat, which is not known for a favourable attitude towards Russian propaganda. Bellingcat’s excellent reporting of this under-discussed topic over the past few years has largely focused on the Azov movement, Ukraine’s most powerful extreme Right-wing group, and the one most favoured by the state’s largesse. A New Zealand couple who believed they had dug up the world’s largest potato in the garden of their small farm near Hamilton have had their dreams turned to mash after Guinness wrote to say that scientific testing had found it wasn’t, in fact, a potato after all. Colin Craig-Brown, who first hit the tuber with a hoe last August when gardening with his wife, Donna, said it sure looked and tasted like a potato. Mind you, he added, he’s never tasted a gourd tuber.Truly nothing better than Brooklyn barbecue… where else can you get all this for $59? pic.twitter.com/hffqHXEPwuRequired Reading is published every Thursday afternoon, and it is comprised of a short list of art-related links to long-form articles, videos, blog posts, or photo essays worth a second look.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Support Critical Aid Efforts in Ukraine With These Art Fundraisers</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 444  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Waiting_4958-1.jpg?fit=720%2C444 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Donate to verified relief organizations by purchasing a print or attending a concert.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents The war in Ukraine is growing more atrocious by the day, with Russian forces increasingly aiming bombs and missiles at civilians. Yesterday, airstrikes hit a theater sheltering hundreds of displaced families in the besieged city of Mariupol, the latest in a concerning number of recent “indiscriminate attacks” flagged by the United Nations as possible war crimes.Ukrainians are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, and while global aid organizations ramp up their important work, the arts community is doing its part to support them, raising funds and awareness. Some initiatives are already proving successful: Polish artist Karol Radziszewski’s print of renowned Ukrainian poet and feminist pioneer Lesya Ukrainka, illustrated above, was sold out in less than three days and helped raise over $11,000 for relief efforts. Below is a selection of ongoing art fundraisers, from online print sales to an in-person concert in New York City. All the organizers have said they will donate 100% of the proceeds to verified entities helping to alleviate the suffering caused by Russia’s senseless war. Four Ukraine-based art organizations — the Museum of Contemporary Art NGO (MOCA), Zaborona, the Naked Room, and Mystetskyi Arsenal — launched the Ukrainian Emergency Art Fund (UEAF) to assist the nation’s art community impacted by the war. The fund, administered by MOCA, offers one-time financial aid or stipends for up to three months for cultural workers from different sectors, from independent curators to researchers and writers. Donations can be made directly on the fund’s website, which also provides a Google Docs form for those in danger to request help.“We immediately felt that this was not just an unexpected tyranny move from Putin, but actually a carefully planned imperialistic ambition of Russia to neo-colonise Ukraine in full spectrum: territory, soil, people and culture,” Ilya Zabolotnyi, CEO and co-founder of UEAF, told Hyperallergic. “That’s when we understood that even during this war it is our task is to ensure the continuity and development of the Ukrainian cultural process during the war, so that the voice of cultural actors of Ukraine remains free, alive and strong.”Artists at Risk (AR), a nonprofit founded by Marita Muukkonen and Ivor Stodolsky in 2013 to protect cultural workers escaping persecution and war, said it has received hundreds of applications from Ukrainian artists and others seeking relocation in recent weeks. The organization is raising funds for emergency resources, travel aid, and shelter through its Solidarity Prints fundraiser, featuring works by 70 artists all priced at €200 (~$222). The sale includes an untitled inkjet print by Rirkrit Tiravanija, whose newsprint collages invite a more profound reflection on current events. In this particular print, the artist overlaid the New York Times’s surreal front page on February 24, the day of the Russian invasion, with a message of hope: “Shine Light Into Dark Places.” Other artists in AR’s sale include Nan Goldin, Isaac Julien, Sanya Kantarovsky, and Amy Sillman.This sensual and humorous painting by Brooklyn-based artist Jay Miriam is included in a fundraising sale for Ukraine organized by Her Clique, a group that elevates the work of women artists and supports like-minded nonprofits. Miriam is joined by Katharine Bradford, Deborah Kass, Marilyn Minter, Laurie Simmons, Cindy Sherman and other artists who donated work to help Voices of Children, a Ukrainian organization providing psychological support to the youngest victims of war. As the Russian invasion continues, Voices of Children is also aiding in evacuation efforts. New works will be added on Her Clique’s website every few days throughout the month of March, coinciding with Women’s Month worldwide.The Brooklyn artist-run center Ortega y Gasset (OyG) will be auctioning one artwork per day on its Instagram account through March 25 with all proceeds benefiting the Ukrainian human rights organization Razom and the UN World Food Programme. The works were donated by artists currently included in OyG’s Surface Tension exhibition and by the center’s own directors. Bidding for each work will start at $100 and last 24 hours, with all bids recorded in the comments section of each artwork’s Instagram post.Through mid-April, Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood is running a fundraising sale featuring many of the artists in its program, including Sandra Cinto, Sabine Hornig, Tomás Saraceno, and Sarah Sze. All proceeds will be evenly distributed between the International Committee of the Red Cross; the Fundacja Ocalenie, which is helping Ukrainian refugees who arrive in Poland; and Voices of Children. According to a gallery spokesperson, the sale has raised over $400,000 so far.This Friday, March 18, over 50 musicians, dancers, and poets will perform in a five-hour concert to benefit Doctors Without Borders in Ukraine at the Clemente Flamboyán Theater in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. The event is organized by the Clemente Soto Cultural Center and two sound and music nonprofits, Arts for Art and Deep Tones for Peace. The lineup includes Frank the London Brass Band and a string ensemble led by violinist Jason Kao Hwang. William Parker, hailed as “the most consistently brilliant free jazz bassist of all time,” will close the event with a full ensemble. Both virtual and in-person tickets are available, with a suggested donation of $25.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Notre Dame Reconstruction Uncovers Ancient Tombs and Sarcophagus</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 480  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/51329161574_598dd31cb7_o-scaled.jpg?fit=720%2C480 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Other archaeological finds include a bust of a bearded man and “sculpted vegetables” buried beneath the fire-ravaged Paris cathedral.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Archaeological excavation at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris has unearthed several tombs and a leaden sarcophagus thought to date from the 14th century, France’s Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot announced in a statement on Monday. Excavation work is taking place ahead of the reconstruction of the church’s spire after a 2019 fire threatened to engulf the cathedral whole. The discoveries were made right beneath the intersection of the church’s transept and its main body.Bachelot specified in her statement that the remains were found in “remarkable scientific quality.” Archaeologists speculate that the coffin — which visibly appears to have been dented by the weight of centuries of compression by earth and stones — contains the remains of an important church dignitary. A miniature endoscopic camera was used to peer inside the sarcophagus, which allowed researchers to detect pieces of fabric, hair, and a pile of leaves resting on the head of the deceased — a typical funerary practice for religious figures. Several tombs and a leaden sarcophagus likely dating from the 14th century have been uncovered by archaeologists at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris as work continues on the building’s reconstruction after its devastating 2019 fire. https://t.co/KsAsyeVCs5 pic.twitter.com/eny4JIZnJr“The fact that these plant elements are still inside means the body is in a very good state of conservation,” Christophe Besnier, lead archaeologist on the team, told the Guardian. In addition to the tombs and coffin, archaeologists have also identified parts of painted sculptures such as pieces from an original 13th-century rood screen, a decorative partition between the altar and the rest of the nave that is a common feature of late medieval church architecture. Agence France-Presse reported in a visit to the site of the excavation that archaeologists could be seen removing a bust of a bearded man and “sculpted vegetables” from the earth. Also uncovered in the excavation was a subterranean heating system serviced by brick pipes dating from the 19th century.The conclusion of the excavation project, set for March 25, heralds the resumption of reconstruction work on the spire, which is to be completed in 2024, in time for the Summer Olympics in Paris. Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>MoMA Renews NYPD Contract, Canceled During BLM Protests, After Stabbing Incident</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 540  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/nypd-moma-2-scaled.jpg?fit=720%2C540 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure The decision hits a sensitive nerve for workers who asked the museum to end its association with the NYPD after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York has increased the presence of armed police officers on its premises in response to last weekend’s horrific stabbing incident, which left two of its employees wounded.In an all-staff meeting on Monday, March 14, the museum’s leadership informed workers that it has renewed a contract for paid security details with the New York Police Department (NYPD) to back up MoMA’s guards, who are unarmed. The decision may be seen as controversial to some museum workers who had pushed management to end a previous contract with the NYPD in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020. The museum also hired details from a private security company, according to several people who attended the meeting.MoMA has not returned Hyperallergic’s repeated requests for comment.The enhanced security measures come after a former museum member identified as 60-year-old Gary Cabana attacked and wounded two front desk employees at the museum’s Film Center entrance on March 12. Security footage showed the suspect leaping over the reception desk and stabbing the workers — a man and a woman, both aged 24 — multiple times in the back, collarbone, and neck. Bellevue Hospital in Midtown Manhattan said both workers were in stable condition and would recover from their injuries.MOMA ATTACK: Police say they re looking for 60-year-old Gary Cabana for yesterday s brutal attack inside the Museum of Modern Art. They say both 24-year-old victims, a woman and a man, are now in stable condition. But this is new video they released of the stabbing. pic.twitter.com/bS5eHo54LOAfter three days on the run, Cabana was apprehended at a bus station in Philadelphia. According to John Miller, NYPD’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, the suspect was “upset” that he was denied entry to the museum after his membership was revoked due to two past incidents “involving disorderly conduct.” Friends and acquaintances of Cabana said that his mental health has deteriorated since he lost his job as a Broadway usher during the pandemic. In a now-removed post on Facebook, he alluded to living with a bipolar disorder.MoMA workers who spoke with Hyperallergic reported an atmosphere of fear and trepidation at the museum in the aftermath of the attack. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because employees were asked by leadership not to give interviews to the press.“We’re shocked at what happened, but we’re not entirely surprised,” said one worker who regularly interfaces with visitors. “We constantly deal with members who throw tantrums, especially at the film department.”The worker said that colleagues have previously expressed safety concerns about the film reception desk, saying it leads to a “cul-de-sac” and could leave workers trapped in the event of an attack. This scenario became a terrifying reality last week, as security footage showed the assaulted workers trapped behind the enclosed, curving desk. The museum has not responded to this allegation; the desk was relocated further inside the building after the attack.Workers at MoMA’s Visitor Engagement department (or Visitor Services) count among the museum’s most vulnerable, lowest-paid employees. The starting annual salary for a full-time Guest Assistant at MoMA is $36,131. After a year, a worker in the department becomes a Guest Specialist at $41,570. Salaries include benefits and tend to rise over the years based on seniority, largely thanks to years of contract negotiations between the museum and UAW Local 2110, the union representing MoMA workers and colleagues at other New York museums.“Wages are higher at MoMA because we’ve been unionized for longer,” said Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110, in an email to Hyperallergic. “Rates at museums that are non-union or have just unionized are much lower. At the Guggenheim and Whitney, for example, people start at $17-$18 an hour, are usually part-time, and don’t have health benefits.”Rosenstein added that the union is currently talking to workers at MoMA about what security measures they would like to see in light of the attack. “It’s been very traumatic, especially for those who work in Visitor Services and Membership,” she said. Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Black Mountain College Prize Awarded to Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh, and Hesam Rahmanian</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 480  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/RaminHaerizadeh-Rokni-Haerizadeh-HesamRahmanian-photoSebastianBoettcher.jpg?fit=720%2C480 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents The BMC Prize, an annual grant of $20,000, celebrates the lasting impact of Black Mountain College in contemporary arts. Dubai-based interdisciplinary artists Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh, and Hesam Rahmanian will have the opportunity to develop their practice in a context that is rich with artistic and cultural significance and ongoing contemporary relevance.Over the past few decades, Ramin, Rokni, and Hesam have shared a life philosophy that has allowed for mutual creation, during which their individual practices interact with their collaborative ones and which is informed by the understanding and technical skills of other people. From the dialogues they build among themselves and with other artists, friends, and collaborators, these artists have established a personal language that enables them to present different layers of content and texture in their work.Origins of the PrizeBlack Mountain College (BMC) was a uniquely global college, with ideas and ideals grounded in worldviews that extend beyond the Western canon. In the same way, the legacy of the college has taken root across the globe, evolving and expanding to encompass disparate identities and forms of expression. Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center (BMCM+AC) is dedicated to preserving the history of BMC as well as facilitating new work through collaboration with contemporary artists. As they advance this mission they look to a blueprint set forth by BMC that valued the greater good, experimentation, and accountability.Funded by cultural pollinators Hedy Fischer and Randy Shull, the BMC Prize will allow BMCM+AC to continue on this path by building relationships and creating an impact with intention by supporting the creation of new work by the most innovative artists working within the BMC tradition today.

		<title>A Brief 100-Year History of Santa Fe Indian Market</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 554  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/IAIA-100-years-featured-image-1.jpg?fit=720%2C554 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure The annual event has survived draconian governmental policies to become the country’s largest public Native American arts and cultural gathering.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents SANTA FE, NM — This summer, hundreds of thousands of visitors are expected to convene in New Mexico’s capital city, where the centennial edition of Santa Fe Indian Market is scheduled to take place in person on Saturday, August 20 and Sunday, August 21, 2022. According to the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA), the juried Native American art fair features approximately 1,000 Indigenous artists from over 200 federally recognized tribes selling works ranging from pottery and textiles to jewelry and paintings.It’s a far cry from its beginnings 100 years ago, when the market’s organizers didn’t allow participating Native American artisans to be seen by the buying public. Today, the country’s largest Native American public event, which features contemporary and traditional Indigenous art from the United States and Canada, is organized and produced by Kim Peone (Colville Confederated Tribes/Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians), who’s supported by a staff of mostly Native American women. Throughout its history, the market has often responded to the country’s changing sociopolitical climate and the evolving creative output of Indigenous artists.“It originally came from a preservation perspective of cultures and now it’s evolved into this place of sustaining and supporting living cultures,” says Peone, who became the executive director of SWAIA, the nonprofit that helms the market, in 2020.The market’s debut in 1922, a smaller affair presented under the mouthful title of The Southwest Indian Fair and Industrial Arts and Crafts Exhibition, was held indoors rather than the bustling Santa Fe Plaza. The event, which included Navajo rugs and Plains Indians beadwork and basketry, focused on ceramics in an effort to revive Pueblo pottery making, according to Cathy Notarnicola, curator of Southwest history at the New Mexico History Museum. (The Santa Fe cultural institution, in partnership with SWAIA, is set to open the Tradition and Innovation exhibition on August 7, 2022 that chronicles the history of the market; it’s scheduled to remain on view through August 2023.)Notarnicola adds that the event borrowed influences from the Panama–California Exposition, a World’s Fair-style shindig that took place in 1915. Edgar Lee Hewett, an archeologist and director of the Museum of New Mexico, attended the San Diego fair and later co-founded what would become Indian Market with Kenneth Chapman.The market attempted to capitalize on New Mexico’s burgeoning tourist industry — tourism remains one of the state’s largest money-making enterprises — that brought visitors to the Land of Enchantment via the Santa Fe Railway, Notarnicola explains. It was also in response to the various failed US government policies — including removal, reservation, and assimilation — that attempted to wipe out Indian Country.“It was like salvage ethnography in an attempt to try to save what was left of Indian cultures after all the devastating policies,” says Notarnicola.“The first market came at it from an anthropological perspective, thinking that they were going to preserve Indian arts because we were on the brink of extinction,” adds Peone.Native artisans weren’t allowed to sell their works in-person at the market until 1931, which predated the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, a federal government policy that attempted to reverse the damages of cultural assimilation.The post-World War II federal Indian policy of termination and relocation — the US government ditched its relationships with tribes so that Native people could be “civilized” into mainstream White society, often in the big cities — did a number on Indian Market.The cultural event bounced back in the 1960s with the beginning of the self-determination era and the 1962 establishment of the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA). Notarnicola says IAIA, founded by Lloyd Kiva New (Cherokee) and George Boyce, is often credited for the inception of contemporary Native art. Fritz Scholder (La Jolla Band of Luiseño Indians) and Allan Houser (Chiricahua Apache) taught at the Santa Fe school; alumni include current US poet laureate Joy Harjo (Muscogee/Creek), sculptor, ceramicist, Indigenous food activist, and gallerist Roxanne Swentzell (Santa Clara Pueblo), and the late painter and printmaker T.C. Cannon (Kiowa/Caddo).“Another major shift occurred with regards to the mission of the market, which, in its origination, preserved traditional designs and technologies of the past,” says Peone. “Today, the market honors and encourages innovation in its works of Native artists.”In the 1970s, the market became a predominantly Native American-represented organization, according to Jamie Schulze (Northern Cheyenne), SWAIA director of operations, and has steadily grown. Today, the annual summer event attracts upwards of 150,000 visitors, who can talk with and purchase work from Native artists throughout approximately 17 city blocks in and around the historic Santa Fe Plaza.“There’s a camaraderie that happens with artists and collectors where every year they get to see each other again and catch up on what’s happened in the past year,” says Notarnicola, who adds that she’s seen the children of artists and collectors grow up together at the market over the last 30 years.Moving forward, Peone says Santa Fe Indian Market, which also produces a yearly winter market, will continue adapting to the contemporary moment while fostering personal and cultural sustainability for Native artists.“We are definitely pivoting,” she says. “We really want to get away from an organization that only concentrates on two markets. How that comes about really comes from the perspective of partnerships and how we want to not only be a part of this community, but contribute to this community 365 days out of the year.”Editor’s Note, 03/18/22, 10:50am EDT: An earlier version of this article mistakenly identified the year Native artisans were allowed to sell work in person at the market as 1933. This has been corrected.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Robert Ryman’s Joyful Last Paintings</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 900  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/RYMRO0094.jpg?fit=720%2C900 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure The pleasure Ryman took in seeing and sensing the world of things so closely is what viewers who are open to his work will take away.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents In 2010 and 2011, Robert Ryman (1930–2019) made a group of eight paintings measuring between 18 by 18 and 24 by 24 inches. All of them were done on mottled grounds in which the weave of the canvas was visible. The grounds were mossy green, dark brown, or earth red — colors we are apt to associate with nature. It is an association that Ryman would most likely have accepted, even as he would also have emphasized, in that soft-spoken demeanor he had, that nature was never a subject he pursued. These modestly scaled paintings — his last body of work before his death in 2019 — constitute the exhibition Robert Ryman: The Last Paintings at David Zwirner (February 10–March 26, 2022), his first with the gallery, which now represents his estate. It is both unfortunate and understandable that Ryman became known during his lifetime as an abstract artist who used only white paint, because “white” is a generalizing term that suppresses all the nuances that one encounters in his work. In each of the exhibition’s eight paintings, the ground is never uniformly one color, as the density of the tone changes. The tonal change becomes evident when the viewer stands close to the painting, which is something that Ryman must have wanted, because, with at least one work, one side is a darker hue than the painting’s surface, suggesting that he added another brushstroke of thin color. These differences and shifts in the ground are picked up in the topography of brushstrokes he built up on the modulated surface, always leaving the painting’s four edges visible. While the visceral shape always fits within the support’s surface, its placement and relationship to the painting’s physical edges vary, as do the brushstrokes. In “Untitled” (2010, 18 by 18 inches, oil on stretched cotton canvas), which was done on an earth-red ground — a color that also calls up Greek red-figure pottery — the shape comes right up to the edge on the painting’s ride side, while Ryman left more space between the paint and the edge of the canvas on the left and along the top and bottom. In this painting, Ryman began with short gray-green brushstrokes, some of which he covered over as he added more paint. After this first layer, he added celadon strokes. By the time he added the thicker white brushstrokes (tinged with ochre yellow), he had already laid down two layers of paint. The white paint sits within the shape made by the first two layers, but Ryman did not try to cover all evidence of what preceded this final layer. The paint’s thickness results in a rough, uneven surface in which the celadon strokes peek through, as do the gray-green strokes that extend beyond the white along the top left and side edges. While these turned out to be Ryman’s last paintings, they do not feel that way — he did not know that he would have an accident and be unable to paint again. There is a joy to these paintings, as well as a playfulness, all arising from the artist’s sensitivity to tone, contrast, placement, and natural light, which is how he would have wanted them to be seen. I remember Ryman suggesting that I go to one of his shows in the late afternoon, when the paintings would be illuminated by the darkening sky filtering in through the skylight. He wanted his work to be seen without being enhanced by artificial light. Ryman’s preoccupation with the relationship between the painting and natural light brings me back to my initial suggestion that nature was key to his work. His belief in paintings as flat, square objects placed against the wall and seen in natural light, as things in the world, is the foundation upon which he developed his practice. That understanding of painting became the circumference within which he worked and where he found immense freedom and joy. While art historians and critics have predominantly focused on what Ryman absorbed from Mark Rothko — a consciousness of the painting’s physical edge and the placement of the shape within — and from the cluster of creamy vertical and horizontal strokes in Philip Guston’s paintings from the early 1950s, it seems to me that he also drew on other inspirations that might be considered unfashionable, which is why they are seldom if ever mentioned. Two of the artists that I am thinking about are Edwin Dickinson and Bradley Walker Tomlin, whose works were in the house Ryman and his wife, the artist Merrill Wagner, lived in for many years. Doesn’t the green that Tomlin used in “Number 9: In Praise of Gertrude Stein” (1950) remind you of some of the greens one finds in Ryman’s paintings? (Isn’t it worth remembering that Guston dedicated a painting to Tomlin and readily admitted that he was an inspiration?) Ryman, who worked as a guard in the Museum of Modern Art for seven years, was an autodidact. He educated himself in the museum and never lost his initial curiosity about paint, materials, and the hardware that went into a painting. For him it was all a joy, inflected with a sense of humor. Nothing about painting was mundane. He knew everything he used had its own identity and he was respectful of that, down to the color of a nail and the shape of its head. The pleasure he took in seeing and sensing the world of things so closely is what viewers who are open to his work will take away. Just as Ryman considered the density and viscosity of paint, whether it was lead or titanium white (and how much red, blue, or yellow ochre it contained), different surfaces (aluminum, Tyvek, canvas, and linen), where to start and stop, and how to affix it to the wall, and was always conscious of every choice he made, always responsible for it, he invites viewers to do the same. We do not just look at a Ryman painting; we see ourselves looking at it, walking around it, scrutinizing the relationship of the painting’s sides to the surface. He was not interested in having a painting reveal itself all at once, and in that regard he stood apart from many of his contemporaries In her groundbreaking book, Robert Ryman: Used Paint (2009) Suzanne P. Hudson cites the artist’s statement about his beginnings: I thought I would see what would happen. I wanted to see what the paint would do, how the brushes would work. This was the first step. I just played around. I had nothing really in mind to paint. I was just finding out how the paint worked, colors, thick and thin, the brushes, the surfaces. While Hudson focuses primarily on what Ryman learned by working in the Museum of Modern Art, where he took an art-education class on experimental painting in 1953 (although he claimed to have no detailed memories of what he learned in it), it should also be stressed that his approach to painting was influenced by his desire to be jazz saxophonist and his study with the pianist Lennie Tristano. When he abandoned that dream and focused on painting he remained true to something bebop musicians embraced: an openness to experiment and to discovering how the instrument worked. His approach to painting reminds me of Rahsaan Roland Kirk’s experiments with all different kinds of saxophones (he was known to wear three around his neck when he played a concert). Disinterested in the idea of the masterpiece, Ryman defined a very different trajectory than that of his peers.  Robert Ryman: The Last Paintings continues at David Zwirner (34 East 69th Street, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through March 26.

		<title>A Lesson in Bad Manners From an Art Provocateur</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 478  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Kippenberger-Modell-Interconti.jpg?fit=720%2C478 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure  i Bad Manners /i  is thoroughly and unmistakably an endeavor of one-time art world provocateur Jake Chapman.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents LONDON — How to characterize Jake and Dinos Chapman? The two brothers first made a big splash in the 1990s, when they fabricated a gruesome, three-dimensional version of an etching by Goya from a series called The Disasters of War. This assemblage of lopped and mutilated, mannequin-like human limbs hanging from a tree was shown in an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1997 called Sensation. It was a nasty piece of work. It likely made you wince because it seemed to lack compassion or human feeling of any kind. It was also entirely characteristic. The brothers seemed to revel in the business of provoking and outraging the world. They wanted to be seen as bruisers, Bad Boys, agents provocateurs. They bristled with a kind of sneery arrogance. I first met them at their studio in London’s Old Kent Road in the autumn of 1998. Jake was the spokesman, the reader, the intellectual, the pushy one; Dinos tended to hang back. Our conversation rapidly declined into an unpleasant argument. Jake heaped mockery and derision on my shoulders. He told me that I knew nothing about art at all. He was even kind enough to give me a reading list. I told him that I honestly thought the 75-page catalogue essay he had written to accompany a show in New York was one of the most pretentious pieces of crap I had ever read, an ill-digested mash-up from bits of Heidegger, Sartre, and others, worthy of a teenager. Jake, I felt, was loving every minute of this bit of verbal brawling. This is how he wanted to engage with art critics and journalists. It would give him notoriety, enemies. And it did. It did. Their eye-catching acts of provocation continued. They reveled in it. They bought a collection of utterly banal paintings by Adolf Hitler, and painted over parts of them in silly and clownish ways. Once again, the action felt attention seeking. What they had done could be taken exception to in a variety of ways. Tastelessness, for example. Who in their right mind would wish to buy and then exhibit — and thereby associate themselves with — bad paintings by a monster called Hitler? And then daub over them? In 2003, they were shortlisted for the Turner Prize, and they put on a considered show of public outrage when they failed to win. Grayson Perry, who became more than their equal at the art of showmanship and look-at-me-ism, beat them to it. It was in that exhibition that they returned once again to Goya, who has proven to be an abiding obsession of theirs. This time they painted over an entire suite of those same etchings referred to above, adding clownish heads and other trivializing details of buffoonish defacement. Oh horror! How the art world howled! All very good for the Chapmans’ publicity machine.And now we are all a quarter of a century older and wiser, and I am talking to Jake Chapman once again — the call is mediated by Yuval Etgar, the young Israeli curator who conceived this exhibition with him — over the telephone from his home in the Cotswolds, which is as far away in mood from the Old Kent Road as you could possibly conceive. Much else has changed. He and his brother have suffered a divorce. They are no longer quite that cheeky twosome, artistic bomb-tossers of the 1990s. Dinos now lives and works as a solo artist in Los Angeles. The Cotswolds, where his brother Jake has his home, is generally depicted as a snapshot of a timeless, sweet-faced rural idyll of the England that once used to be. “What’s happened then?” I ask Jake. Was it a painless divorce? We were never joined at the hip, Jake tells me. It wasn’t a symbiotic relationship. He always read a lot, whereas Dinos didn’t. Is he still a Bad Boy? I wonder. He partly answers the question for me without my even having to ask. It’s quite hard, he tells me, going from being a YBA to an OAP …The new show is, nevertheless, a thoroughgoing and unmistakably Chapman endeavor. Having said that, it is also less shrill and combative than in the past, and perhaps more calmly thought-provoking. Yet it still manages to include the odd whiff of quite deliberate — and perhaps even tasteless, if not downright unpleasant — provocation. The press materials tell us that the show — which is called Bad Manners — is an exploration of “non-consensual” collaborations between artists from about the middle of the 19th century to the present day. You cannot help but linger over that compound adjective, “non-consensual,” and quietly reflect upon the fact that it is most often used in the context of sexual assault. So the ante is being raised — as usual.So what exactly do we have in this gallery today? We have a number of works that could be described as cannibalistic: an artist has acquired a work by another artist and done something with it and to it — drawn on it, added to it, turned it into a part of something quite different from what it was in the first place, and all without the permission of its creator. Once this happens, confusion sets in: who is now the creator of this work? Is there anger and dismay too? Not necessarily from the original creator because he or she may be dead, and therefore beyond the reach of caring at all. One of the most interesting examples of cannibalistic collaboration in this show is what looks like a smallish wooden coffee table raised up on a low plinth. In many respects it looks thoroughly unremarkable. And yet something rather odd has happened to its surface. In fact, set into that surface is an abstract painting by Gerhard Richter. Who had the barefaced cheek to turn a painting by Richter into the surface of something as banal and unremarkable as a coffee table on which you might easily and unthinkingly plonk down a cup of coffee? Martin Kippenberger did it, one of the postwar German bad boys — they do come in many different nationalities. And did Richter complain? I ask Yuval Etgar. Not as far as he knows. He probably thought it was quite a good joke. Artists generally don’t complain when this sort of thing happens. They leave that to the collectors, the dealers, the advertising men.  Bad Manners: On the Creative Potentials of Modifying Other Artists’ Work continues at Luxembourg + Co.

		<title>Cuban Artists Test the Frontiers of Political Dissent</title>

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Against the backdrop of Cuba’s ongoing assault on human rights, an otherwise prosaic image of a bus without passengers becomes unnaturally haunting. In Raychel Carrión’s monochrome graphite drawing “Romper” (2020) — “to break” — rows of empty bus seats emerge from a thick, textured darkness akin to smog. In the foreground, the distinct shape of a police baton can be discerned amid the sinuous curves of metal railings, chain-like patterns, and strap handles that resemble hooks — mundane elements made sinister.“On the 27th of January, in front of Havana’s Ministry of Culture, agents of Cuban state police beat approximately 20 activists, artists, and reporters who were reading poetry,” reads a wall label for the work now on view at Montserrat Gallery in Manhattan, written in Spanish. “That day it was shown that in Cuba, what is called ‘culture’ is just another arm of power and repression.” An audio clip accompanying the piece amplifies the screams heard as officers apprehended participants of the pacific homage to Cuban author and journalist José Martí, shoving them onto the bus Carrión so uncannily captured.Some of the artists included in Umbral, conceived by Havana-based curators Claudia Genlui and Anamely Ramos, were present that dark day in Havana, and are often on the frontlines of similar incidents so frequent in Cuba that they have become almost commonplace. In this exhibition of works by Cuban artists, activists, and members of the dissident San Isidro Movement, several names are familiar for their recurrence in headlines decrying state repression of free speech and creative freedom. One of Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara’s symbolic Door paintings hangs next to a blue hard hat worn by the artist as part of a performance piece during the month of February 2020, after three children died when a building collapsed in Old Havana the previous year. Alcántara was detained several times for wearing the helmet in public, a wall text says. And he remains in a maximum-security prison in Havana at the time of this writing, behind bars for the last eight months as one of hundreds arrested during historic anti-government protests on the island last year. When Umbral opened on March 5, Genlui, his partner, had not heard from Alcántara in weeks and knew his health was rapidly declining after he declared a hunger strike in January; it was not his first. Last year’s peaceful demonstrations in Cuba, which found echoes in solidarity protests around the world, were largely prompted by longstanding food and medicine shortages and poverty exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two prints by Aryam Rodriguez feature bottles of rum the Cuban government handed out to households last December, a strategy to deflect attention from these scarcities, as a wall text explains. The rum was distilled using sugar from the 2020-2021 Zafra harvest, dubbed the “worst in the last 120 years in Cuba” due to lack of fuel, machinery parts, and low yields.Ramos explains the resonance of the title Umbral, or “threshold,” as “the idea of remaining at the entrance of something, but at a distance.” “The fundamental thesis is that when you talk about Cuba, you have to enter a previous, introductory space, the Umbral, where certain notions that are difficult for the rest of the world to understand are explained through the voices of these artists who are in danger,” Ramos told Hyperallergic at the opening of the show. The term encompasses the specific dystopia of voicing dissent while living on the island as well as the tension of existing as a Cuban citizen anywhere in the world, as the government maintains discretionary power to deny entry into or exit out of the country. Ramos currently finds herself currently inhabiting this “liminal space,” she adds: When she attempted to return to Havana from the United States last month, gate agents prevented her from boarding the flight.“Umbral was created from a place of permeability,” Ramos said. “It is resistance, it’s an attempt to reflect on what a frontier is, where Cuba begins and where it ends, and what it means to be safe in Cuba today.”Artist Camila Lobón, a Camagüey native whose works on view include illustrations designed for various civic actions on the island, recently completed a residency in Miami and plans on returning to Cuba. “The generation I identify with has a deep consciousness around this question of naturalizing the fact of returning, of entering and leaving and coming back, of regaining our ownership over the territory,” Lobón told Hyperallergic. “In my case, I don’t think about the concept of country or nationalism — it’s my home, it’s where the people I love are, and for that reason, I have the right to be there,” she said.In their subtle elegance, Lobón’s drawings are tacitly subversive. One of them depicts three stages in the metamorphosis of a butterfly labeled with the words “resistance, contempt, and disobedience,” the charges on which rapper Maykel Osorbo was arrested in May 2021. Another, a drawing of José Martí modeled after Cuban modernist Jorge Arche’s iconic portrait of the writer, was made for a “poetic pilgrimage” calling for the liberation of rapper Denis Solis in 2020. “I have two homelands: Cuba and the night,” it reads, citing Martí’s poem. “Or are they one?”“Carolina [Barrero], a historian and activist, had the idea of making these as posters and giving them away. We never got to do that, because police intervened in her home, found the prints, and accused her of ‘clandestine printing,’” Lobón said. “Something as simple as the image of Martí, because of the gesture it implied about autonomy over an image, over an idea, is seen as an act of rebellion in Cuba.” Alexis Romay, a Cuban writer and teacher who attended the opening of Umbral, left the island in 1999. When asked if he plans on returning, he quotes Heraclitus: “No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.”“I resist the hyphen: I don’t call myself ‘Cuban-American.’ I am profoundly Cuban,” Romay told Hyperallergic. “But like many other Cubans, I told myself that I cannot return to that Cuba. I can’t return to a place from which I escaped.”“What they are doing — Anamely, Camila, Claudia — is asserting the idea that this country is ours,” he continued. “I don’t think I’ll ever step on Cuban soil again, but if I do, it’s because of them. They are returning to me a country that I had lost.”A screen plays the music video for “¿De qué me van a hablar?” (“What are they going to talk to me about?”) (2021) shot by Anyelo Troya and featuring Osorbo and Elexer Funk “El Funky,” which calls for freedom for Alcántara and members of the San Isidro Movement. Osorbo and El Funky are co-authors of “Patria y Vida,” which became a rallying cry for freedom during the peaceful protests of July 2021. When the video for that song began to “spread like wildfire” among Cubans, wrote curator Coco Fusco for Hyperallergic, the government launched a defamation campaign against it that included homophobic attacks. Osorbo is currently in prison and El Funky lives in exile in the US. Troya is in Havana with a yearlong order that restricts his mobility. In a small room in the back of the gallery, Indira Romero, a Cuban artist and performer, offers tarot readings with a deck of cards illustrated by many of the artists in the show. The High Priestess was designed by Lobón, a jovial portrait of Cuban salsa musician Celia Cruz mid-song against a background of papayas. Hamlet Lavastida, who was forced into exile last year after three months in prison in Cuba, drew number 15, the Devil: the unmistakable silhouette of Fidel Castro pointing a gun. “Our cry should not be in vain,” Genlui wrote in a statement for the exhibition. “Luis Manuel always said that art gives us the possibility of helping everyone understand. Today, he and Maykel assume that cry in the form of extreme sacrifice; today, through curation and art, we are by their sides, we transit that threshold and we invite the world to understand us.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Street Photography That Highlights the Female Gaze</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 1123  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/PF102005.jpeg?fit=720%2C1123 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Twelve women photographers demonstrate their creative ingenuity and raw technical skill.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Ask why blue-chip photography galleries represent fewer women than men, and you might hear a supply-side argument: “A century ago, there just weren’t that many women making museum-quality work.” A Female Gaze: Seven Decades of Women Street Photographers, now on view at Howard Greenberg Gallery, proves this theory false. Encompassing work by 12 women photographers that spans the course of the 20th century, this impressive exhibition showcases these artists’ creative ingenuity and their raw technical skill. The exhibition title cleverly inverts Laura Mulvey’s concept of “the male gaze” — which, according to Mulvey’s well-known essay, objectifies and fetishizes its female subjects — while rightly acknowledging that its artists’ perspectives are not universal; it is a vision, not the vision. A Female Gaze includes a wide range of street photography, not all of which was taken at street level. Several works by Ruth Orkin were taken looking down from the artist’s apartment window, giving the scenes an angled, almost Constructivist appearance. “Man in Rain”(1952) is one such image, which masterfully captures individual raindrops — no easy feat, even with today’s digital technology. Berenice Abbott’s show-stopping aerial photograph “Night View, New York”(1932) is one of those works that now looks cliché because of the decades of photographers who have tried to imitate it. The level of detail in the gargantuan gelatin silver print is startling; despite the photograph’s 15-minute exposure time, one can still make out the rooms behind each illuminated window.Many of the women in A Female Gaze were members of the Photo League, a New York cooperative of socially conscious photographers that was active from 1936 until 1951, when its leftist origins landed it on a Justice Department blacklist. The organization championed work that was both aesthetically composed and socially significant; for example, Helen Levitt, one of the better-known female photographers associated with the group, documented children on the on the streets of New York and the chalk drawings they left behind. One of the works from this series, “N.Y.” (c. 1942), depicts a delightfully youthful chalk portrait of a girl with a sly smile. Positioned so that only the plane of the sidewalk is in view, the photograph itself becomes a kind of abstract drawing, recalling Brassaï’s Graffiti photo series of the 1930s. Women like Levitt made up almost a third of the League’s membership, serving significant roles within the organization at a time when women were rarely allowed such agency.Whether these women of the Photo League were really “encouraged equally alongside their male counterparts” as the press release claims is up for debate; as Catherine Evans writes in The Radical Camera: New York’s Photo League 1936-1951, the League “encouraged women but did not entirely support them.” Photo League editors — just like their gallery and institutional counterparts — favored work by male photographers, leaving many of the group’s female members to return to the domestic roles that society expected of them. Today, much of their work has been lost.Hopefully, A Female Gaze signals a new direction for Howard Greenberg Gallery’s program, which has skewed disproportionately white and male. While the art world has become increasingly conscious of gender and racial inequity in recent years — and the gallery itself is predominantly staffed by women — its program has in fact become less equal along gender lines over the past decade. From 2013 to 2015, its website indicates that 26 percent of its solo exhibitions were of female artists; from 2016-2018, as the MeToo movement gained traction, this figure dropped to 18 percent. Since 2018, solo presentations by female artists now stand at a dismal 7 percent. Of the 66 artists that Howard Greenberg lists as representing on its primary roster, 10 of them are women. (Only two Black artists are included in this list: Gordon Parks and James Van Der Zee.)From its inception, Howard Greenberg Gallery has championed a socially conscious approach to photography similar to that of the Photo League; a pioneer in the art market, the gallery fought for photojournalism and street photography’s place in the canon. Its program, however, hasn’t always matched its ethos. As one of New York City’s leading photo galleries—particularly as one that describes its collection as “a living history of photography”—it should strive to represent an accurate, more complete view of that history. As Mary Ellen Mark once said, “nothing is more interesting than reality.”A Female Gaze: Seven Decades of Women Street Photographers continues at Howard Greenberg Gallery (41 East 57th Street, Suite 801, Midtown, Manhattan) through April 2.Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<title>Presence and Absence in Virtual Reality Storytelling</title>
		<description> figure  img alt=   class= attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image  height= 450  src= https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/as-mine-exactly.png?fit=720%2C450 amp;quality=100 amp;ssl=1  width= 720  /  /figure Charlie Shackleton talks to Hyperallergic about his performance piece  i As Mine Exactly /i  and the challenges of virtual reality filmmaking.</description>
		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents The Museum of the Moving Image’s annual First Look program is a terrific way for New Yorkers to see some of the most exciting new experimental film and documentary work emerging early each year. The 2022 iteration includes several timely works about Ukrainian/post-Soviet history, a pre-COVID meditation on isolation from Poland, a survey of men who live in abandoned missile launch silos, and much more. One of the more exciting picks is As Mine Exactly, a virtual reality performance piece by filmmaker Charlie Shackleton. During the experience, a participant sits across from Shackleton in a room and straps on a VR headset. Shackleton then reads his lines aloud in the room as imagery from his youth plays on the participant’s screen, laying out the story of his mother’s experiences with epilepsy and how seeing her seizures as a boy impacted him. He not only narrates, but also “converses” with his mother, whose voice is heard through a speaker positioned behind the viewer. By actively mediating the participant’s interactions with this anecdote, Shackleton draws attention to the ways we already reframe and perform our pasts, both in how we personally process events and how we relate them to others. Hyperallergic sat down with Shackleton over Zoom to discuss the piece and the logistical and artistic headaches involved in making it. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and brevity.* * *Hyperallergic: Why was it important that you be a physically present part of this experience?Charlie Shackleton: I had qualms about telling this story on film to begin with, because it felt so personal, intimate, and sensitive. Some of the material and experience I let people in on, I was daunted by. I think when I had the idea of it becoming a one-on-one performance, that felt like it circumstantially matched what it represented to me to be sharing this story. However I did it, it would’ve felt like I was confiding in the audience, so why not stage it in such a way that I am literally doing that? And everything that would bring to the performance would heighten the themes of the story. It is so much about presence and absence, so to have me present with the viewer underlined that in a way nothing else really could.H: Especially since, even though you are physically present, there’s the distancing element of the audience member wearing the VR headset.CS: Yeah. It’s fascinating to watch people do it. You’re intensely close to someone in a way that you almost never are with a stranger. I’m staring at their face for half an hour, but they can’t see me back. They can hear me, how proximate I am to them, but it’s a weird kind of proximity that’s unlike anything else. I come out of it — and I think they come out of it — feeling both really close to the other person but also weirdly alienated from them. And again, that felt right for this. I can’t imagine doing another piece like this, because I don’t know what kinds of stories it would suit.H: How did you prepare to perform this way? What effect have the performances so far had on you?CS: I think I prepared in all the wrong ways. [laughs] I did have a long time to think about it, and I knew that it was going to be exhausting — emotionally, physically, even technically, having to be in command of the various components. All that turned out to be true, but in a different way than I ever could’ve imagined. I think what I didn’t really prepare myself for was how psychologically intense it is for a succession of different people go through something emotionally with you. And the reactions really varied. Sometimes it was easy to tell how someone was feeling, sometimes it was quite hard. But I think it left a psychic impact on me as well, just watching them receive it.H: Subjectivity is a recurring theme in your work. CS: My short Personal Truth made me think about the layers of mediation in telling a personal story. Not only was my notionally conversational voiceover obviously scripted and had been reread so many times in recording it, but also what I was expressing as my unvarnished perspective was of course heavily filtered. It had been through many rounds of drafts in an attempt to make it satisfying, structurally and emotionally. I’d always had this slightly uneasy relationship with how I presented myself in my own work; it’s a strange semi-real, semi-unreal version. I knew that in telling a story that was so personal, I had to confront that within it. It would be dishonest to say that I can tell a story about this incredibly formative part of my life impartially or without artifice.H: How did you plot out what to put into the headset screen, and how to present it, edit it, arrange it, and more?CS: One of the things I like about that technology is that it feels experimental. You put the headset on and you can decide what you’re going to do inside it; it can be completely spontaneous and impulsive. I didn’t see that reflected in any of the broadly defined ‘film work’ being made for VR. It instead felt like everything was super polished. There’s a focus on immersion that leads people toward sanding off all the rough edges and making grand statements. I was interested in VR as a DIY tool, especially because the technology is still so ropy and breaks as often as it works. It’s only as useful as what it allows you to do, not for its own innate being. I wanted to make something that would evolve quickly and responsively as I was road-testing it. It’s never going to stop evolving as long as I’m performing it. It’s already changed quite a lot just over the course of a week of doing it.The material evolved in response to showing it to people. I had endless material, thousands of childhood photographs and videos and things I’d written, things my mom had written, any of which could’ve been included — and a lot of which was included, at one point or another. But when you get someone in a headset, it’s fascinating to see where their focus sharpens and where it doesn’t. I can see where they’re looking, what’s catching their attention and whether that aligns with my intention. Those moments are what I tried to build the piece around.Initially I did what I think 99% of people who first make work for VR do, which is shoot a load of 360-degree footage. But because my piece is a theatrical performance as much as it is a work of VR, I had two spaces I needed to orchestrate: the 360-degree canvas of the headset and the physical space I and the participant occupy. And often the two worked against each other. I found that if I started the piece and all I gave them to look at was an image I put directly in front of them, they would focus intensely forward on that spot, which was where I was in the room. That bond was intense, and something I could exploit to create the intimate relationship the piece relies on. But when I showed them a 360-degree video, that bond was instantly severed; they’d look around, look behind themselves. And as fun or immersive as it might’ve been, I never got back that focus. That led me to strip back how much of the virtual canvas I occupied, to maintain control of the audience member’s focus.Something that’s also interesting about VR is the void, which you don’t often get to see because most of the work is so visually populated. You don’t usually get to linger on the strange absence of a frame, but I think that’s intriguing. If I put something in someone’s peripheral vision in a space they had gotten used to being blank, you can see how radical it is for them to suddenly breach this imagined wall. That wouldn’t be the case if I had quickly filled in all the space and shown them a 360-degree vision of my childhood street.H: What technical and artistic changes have you made in this road-testing process?CS: Pacing is probably the biggest thing. What feels right when I’m rehearsing feels totally different in an actual atmosphere with a human being. The pauses are often much longer now than I ever imagined they would be, either because the person is reacting in some way that I need to leave space for, or just because something strikes me in the moment and it feels like it needs to breathe.I also need to reassure people as early as possible that they don’t have to perform. I really need to get that in the synopsis. If I was a viewer, I would be put off by the idea that it was immersive theater, where you have to play a role. I don’t want to only have a self-selecting audience of people who would be up for that kind of thing. It needs to be clear that it’s very low-key, low pressure, that the experience is ultimately being told a story by another human being.First Look 2022 runs March 16-20 at the Museum of the Moving Image (36-01 35 Avenue, Astoria, Queens).Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents We’ve all heard of sealing letters with a kiss, but what if the message you want to send is, “Stop fucking invading my country”? Ukraine has got you covered, with a new stamp that commemorates Ukrainian soldier Roman Gribov’s reply to a Russian warship that asked his force on Snake Island to surrender: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself!”Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzheppar, announced the stamp in a tweet earlier this week. The stamp’s design, featuring a panoramic view of a Ukrainian soldier giving an approaching Russian warship the middle finger, was created by Ukrainian artist Boris Groh and submitted to a public contest by the Ukrainian Postal Service (Ukrposhta). The postage stamp named  Russian warship, go f**k yourself!  will appear in🇺🇦. The sketch by artist Boris Groh received the most votes and will soon be published by Ukraine s state postal company.🇺🇦✌️#StandWithUkraine#StopRussianAgression pic.twitter.com/ByYAzw2tYqGroh’s entry was the winner through social media upvotes, beating out a field of four finalists that included a graphic sinking Russian warship with the included text dripping blood; a subtle Snake Island carved out against a Ukrainian yellow ocean and blue sky telling a huge Russian warship to fuck itself; and one that rendered the small troop of soldiers stationed on the island on a little bit of land, buoyed by their iconic battle cry. Groh proved that a picture is worth a thousand words, as the only entry to elide the phrase entirely, replacing it with a single, eloquent gesture.The stamp is only the latest in what is being considered a masterful public image campaign on the part of Ukraine, encouraging national fortitude and international aid through a heady combination of stalwart determination to hold their ground, and wacky memes. Just as their Russian foes were early adopters of social media as a tool for disinformation and passive disruption of international politics, Ukraine seems to well understand the power of propaganda as a rallying call. And while it is somewhat unorthodox to put literal profanities on postage stamps, and canonize those who utter them as national heroes, it feels extremely fitting given the circumstances.

		<text>Hyperallergic Sensitive to Art   its Discontents Maryland’s last public Confederate monument, the “Talbot Boys Statue” outside the Talbot County courthouse in Easton, was removed on March 14. The move marked a resolution to two decades of contestation over the statue, which will now be moved to Cross Keys Battlefield in Harrisonburg, Virginia, where it will be stewarded by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation.Standing at 13 feet in height at the courthouse lawn, the monument portrays a Confederate regiment from Talbot County that served in the Civil War. Erected in 1916, a single soldier totes a Confederate flag and peers into the distance wistfully. The granite base is inscribed with the names of 96 Confederate soldiers associated with the county in some way, with the front reading, “To the Talbot Boys / 1861-1865 / C.S.A.” Previously positioned prominently on the greens just outside the courts where local residents would have to get essential business taken care of, the statue was a visual reminder of the persistence of unequal justice and racism in the United States. It also occupied the very spot where a slave auction block once stood.Guess what you don’t see in this picture? The Talbot Boys. The last confederate monument on public grounds in Maryland is gone. Frederick Douglass finally has the lawn to himself. Congrats to all involved @MTMCoalition @BoysTalbot cc: @cncep @ClintSmithIII pic.twitter.com/jY0QkXlLcHThe county council voted to remove the monument in September after several failed attempts in 2015, 2016, and 2020. Subsequently, a nonpartisan coalition of local citizens came together under the banner of the Move the Monument Coalition to raise $82,000 for the relocation of the statue. While Maryland was part of the Union in the Civil War, many of its counties were divided, including Talbot County. There, family members found themselves fighting each other in battle. Although three times as many fought for the Union as for the Confederacy in the county, a promised Union monument to accompany the Confederate one was never realized. As such, Talbot County is often misremembered as a Confederate bastion in the state. A statue of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who was born just 12 miles away, does stand on the lawn, though it was only erected in 2011 after a long fight.#BREAKING: it’s a big day in Easton today: the Talbot Boys Confederate monument is coming down. The statue came down earlier. Now crews are preparing to remove the base. #TalbotBoys #Easton @stardem_news pic.twitter.com/xOFlTuHYLPPut in place almost half a century after the end of the Civil War — when the sun was already setting on the era of Reconstruction and Confederate nostalgia was on the rise — the statue was spearheaded by Joseph Seth, a lawyer and eventual mayor of Easton. In his memoir, he expressed that enslaved people “lived under a paternal, kindly rule” on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, regurgitating sentimentally violent falsehoods about the antebellum South. The statue was therefore “erected at a time when Confederate statues were used as a means of racial intimidation,” a legal complaint filed by the Talbot County Branch of the NAACP against the county in May 2021 read.A public information request late last year showed that almost 900 people had contacted the Talbot County council about the statue during a public comment period. Of that group, over 700 argued for its removal.“Frederick Douglass finally has the lawn to himself,” tweeted Maryland resident Sandy Boyd, CEO of the nonprofit Seek Common Ground. “Congrats to all involved.”Jaishri Abichandani’s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork — as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist’s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA’s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year’s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it’s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood’s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

		<text>We use cookies to enhance your experience. By continuing to browse this site you agree to our use of cookies. More info.A recent article posted to the Research Square* preprint server and under consideration at Scientific Reports evaluated a novel hygiene concern that emerged during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, i.e., the adherence of fungi and bacteria to face masks. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has prompted people to use face masks in public regularly. The three kinds of commercially marketed face masks are 1) cloth or gauze masks, 2) non-woven masks, and 3) polyurethane masks.The World Health Organization (WHO) states that masks are only beneficial in combating COVID-19 when combined with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand hygiene. Moreover, the factors like correct mask use and disposal are also of paramount significance in curtailing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While viruses cannot multiply without infecting host cells, most fungi and bacteria may exist and reproduce on various substrates (public transportation system, currency notes) depending on the circumstances. Despite substantial research into the efficiency of face masks in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is no clarity on the possible hygiene difficulties caused by fungi and bacteria adhered to the mask surfaces. Furthermore, the hygiene of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical as the fungal and bacterial infections from the masks could aggravate COVID-19 infection.In the current work, the researchers demonstrated 1) the types and duration of mask use, 2) the number of fungi and bacteria adhering to the masks, and 3) the characterization of the fungi and bacteria sticking to masks. The team surveyed 109 medical students at Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Japan, on their mask use during September and October 2020. The scientists assessed the association between microbes adhered to masks and factors associated with the subjects like gender, age, gargling habit, duration of mask use, natto consuming habit, and transportation. In addition, they also cultured bacteria and fungus on these volunteers  masks.Before enrollment, informed consent was procured from all subjects, of which 63 were males, and 46 were females. The scientists ensured that none of the study participants were treated with antimicrobials during the research period. Microbes attached to the face masks were isolated by pressing the outer side and face side of the masks separately onto agar plates. These plates were then immediately covered to prevent contamination and then cultured. Subsequently, the fungal and bacterial colony counts were estimated.Employing MiSeq, the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing was conducted. Fungi were identified by examining the colony microscopically and their morphology following lactophenol cotton blue staining. The results indicated that the bacteria colony counts were overall more than fungus colony counts on face masks. Further, fungal and bacterial colony counts were higher on the outer side and face side of the mask, respectively. The longer the mask was worn, the higher the fungal colony counts were, but this was not the case for bacterial colony counts. Non-woven masks harbored fewer fungi on the outside than other mask varieties. Despite the fact that bacterial colony counts were equivalent in all mask kinds, women had lower face-side counts than males.According to the findings of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the Cladosporium genus, which was the most often identified fungus in this investigation, was discovered more frequently in females. B. subtilis was found more often on the masks of individuals who ate natto at least monthly. On the other hand, transportation systems were not linked to bacterial or fungal colony numbers. Of note, the ROC results were congruent with the study s findings. There were no significant variations in microbial colony counts across non-woven and other mask types when comparing the microbial colony counts based on mask type. The high fungal colony counts on the outer side of masks, according to these data, were linked to the length of mask use rather than the mask type. Immunocompromised individuals should be urged to use non-woven masks regularly, although the majority of the fungus found in this investigation were opportunistic pathogens. A foodborne pathogen named B. cereus was found on the outside of masks in 5% of the volunteers. This suggests that B. cereus may have gotten onto the masks through the hands from excrement. The authors advised intensive handwashing as it effectively lowered the occurrence of diarrhea.Females who applied foundation on the left half of the face and wore face masks for four hours demonstrated no variation in bacterial colony counts across both sides of the face. Additionally, while facial skincare probably lowered bacteria on masks, it increased the presence of fungi. Similarly, those who used facial cleansers in the morning demonstrated lower bacterial counts but higher fungal counts.The study findings implied that bacterial colony counts were higher on the face side of the masks than on the outer side. On the contrary, fungal colony numbers were lower on the face side than on the outer side of the masks. While the fungal colony counts were considerably higher after wearing the mask for extended periods, this was not the case for the bacterial colony counts. Although the majority of the detected microbes such as S. aureus, Cladosporium, and S. epidermidis were non-pathogenic, pathogenic microbes such as Microsporum, B. cereus, Aspergillus, and S. saprophyticus were also found.Collectively, the present research indicates that individuals, particularly those with impaired immune systems, should avoid repeated usage of masks to forestall microbial infection. The present findings shed light on the usage of face masks to prevent potentially pathogenic infections during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Preprints with Research Square publish preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.Ah-Mee Park, et al. 2022. Bacterial and Fungal Isolation from Face Masks: Newly Emerged Hygiene Issues Under COVID-19 Pandemic.

		<title>Genomic sequencing reveals unique pattern of SARS-CoV-2 Epsilon emergence in Alaska</title>
		<description>Researchers used genomic sequencing to examine SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Alaska, United States, between December 2020 and June 2021.</description>
		<text>We use cookies to enhance your experience. By continuing to browse this site you agree to our use of cookies. More info.In a recent study posted to the medRxiv* pre-print server, researchers used genomic sequencing to examine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from Alaska, United States (US), between December 2020 and June 2021.During this period, Alaska witnessed a surge in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases due to the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.519 (Epsilon), and a founder effect contributed to the unique pattern of B.1.1.519 emergence and dissemination in Alaska.Several studies have suggested that geographic and sociodemographic factors contribute to the emergence, evolution, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants globally.Despite being the largest state in the US by area, Alaska has the lowest population density and has unique community dynamics compared to the contiguous US states (lower 48). While its two economic regions are densely populated and highly intersected, its rural areas are sporadically populated and reachable by water or air transportation.It is approximately 800 km from the lower 48, so the researchers explored how different was Alaska’s pattern of SARS-CoV-2 variant emergence. Expectedly, they observed prominent differences in the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 Epsilon variant between Alaska and the lower 48 in early 2021.In the current study, researchers downloaded 2,323 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available on the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), and starting February 2022, they analyzed these sequences to increase genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants as part of the Alaska SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing Consortium. The serum samples for these sequences were collected by the authorities of the Alaska Division of Public Health (AKDPH) and volunteers of the University of Alaska between 29 November 2020 and 26 June 2021 in Alaska, US.For the lower 48, the research team gathered 1,331,799 sequences from GenBank, including Pangolin assignment, geolocation, and isolate for all the samples; additionally, they filtered out cases from Hawaii, Alaska, and other US territories to limit study comparisons to the lower 48. They used the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 data tracker site for gathering daily case data with a mean of seven days.The study presented an estimate of the prevalence of the following SARS-CoV-2 lineages - B.1.617.2 and AY sublineages (Delta), B.1.525 (Eta), B.1.1.519, B.1.427/429 (Epsilon), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), C.37 (Lambda), B.1.526 (Iota), B.1.621 (Mu), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), and P.1 (Gamma) in Alaska compared to the lower 48.The SARS-CoV-2 variant prevalence data were computed for each week during the study period and compared to prevalence rates in other geographical locations, especially the lower 48.The researchers used the Nextclade version 1.13.2 to determine the number of the amino acid (AA) mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. The Wilcoxon test was used to identify the differences in AA mutations between the emerging sublineages and lineages.The analysis of genomic data from outbreak.info, a sequence repository of GISAID, showed that Epsilon was highly prevalent worldwide in early March 2021, a month before Alaska’s peak prevalence. Notably, this variant was detected in sequencing data from Alaska five weeks after its detection in the US, i.e., in December 2020.By the end of January 2021, Alpha and Epsilon had emerged and were being steadily detected in the US sequencing data, thus, 5% of sequenced cases in the lower 48 were due to Alpha by this time. However, at this time, Alaska had only one case of Alpha and no cases of Epsilon. In February 2022, Epsilon constituted 10.4% of Alaska’s SARS-CoV-2 sequences; such high prevalence rates also point at temporal and spatial heterogeneity in sequencing data.Epsilon reached a peak prevalence of 77.9% in Alaska, five weeks after attaining the peak in the lower 48. Epsilon comprised a high percentage of sequenced cases from January to March 2021 in the Interior economic region of Alaska, 360 miles away from its another large economic region, the Anchorage-Mat Su.By the end of February, Epsilon accounted for 37.8% and 10.5% of sequenced cases in the Anchorage-Mat Su and the Interior regions, respectively. By April 2021, the proportions of Epsilon sequenced cases in the Interior and the Anchorage-Mat Su regions were 77.2% and 72.6%, respectively. After attaining a peak on April 4, 2021, the prevalence of Epsilon in May decreased to 74.1% and 38.8% for the Interior and Anchorage-Mat Su regions, respectively.The study revealed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes (from Alaska) occurred in a clockwise manner. The Wilcoxon test results suggested that Epsilon had more AA substitutions in the S protein than lineages detected in Alaska before its peak prevalence. Therefore, it had a competitive advantage over pre-peak circulating lineages; however, genomes sequenced after its peak prevalence were assigned to Alpha and Delta, having more AA mutations than Epsilon. This finding indicates that both Alpha and Delta had a selective advantage that allowed them to replace Epsilon in Alaska, a phenomenon also previously observed across Alpha and Delta waves in the USA.The founder effect reduced the genetic diversity from a founding SARS-CoV-2 lineage that helps it outcompete its previously circulating lineage(s) because the founding population had a selective advantage, thus explaining how Epsilon likely emerged and became dominant in Alaska. In other US states, especially the lower 48, the same trend was not observed. This was most likely because Alpha, which could potentially outcompete Epsilon, had already established itself within the population.At a country level, for instance, in Mexico, Epsilon was first detected in November 2020, about three months before its detection in Alaska. Thereafter, Epsilon rapidly outcompeted existing variants to become the dominant variant in Mexico comprising 51.5% of sequenced genomes by January 2021.The stud demonstrated the importance of robust genomic sequencing efforts to examine the distinctive and unique patterns of SARS-CoV- 2 variant emergence and transmission. Further, the study highlighted how founder effects influenced the observed regional differences in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Alaska.Overall, the study data could prove beneficial in informing public health decisions when SARS-CoV-2 will become endemic in Alaska and globally.medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.Posted in: Medical Research News | Medical Condition News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: Amino Acid, Avian Influenza, Coronavirus, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19, covid-19, Evolution, Genetic, Genomic, Genomic Sequencing, Glycoprotein, Influenza, Protein, Public Health, Research, Respiratory, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SyndromeWritten byNeha is a digital marketing professional based in Gurugram, India.

		<title>Novel non-extensive statistical model to study COVID-19 epidemic distribution</title>
		<description>Researchers modified and developed a SIR model within the framework of non-extensive statistics to show the complexity of the global COVID-19 epidemic distribution.</description>
		<text>We use cookies to enhance your experience. By continuing to browse this site you agree to our use of cookies. More info.In a new study posted to the Research Square* preprint server and under consideration at Scientific Reports, researchers modified and developed a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model within the framework of non-extensive statistics to show the complexity of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic distribution.Several statistical models, including susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) models, have been formulated to predict the epidemic progression of the West Africa Ebola epidemic of 2014, the SARS epidemic of 2003, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, further refinement in terms of parameterizing a model is crucial for analyzing and predicting the behavior of pandemics.Moreover, given the high interconnectedness of the world nowadays, the underlying idea behind the concept of ‘Global Village,’ the classical statistical approaches seem inadequate to study the epidemiology of the unprecedented COVID-19-pandemic.In the current study, researchers introduced a non-extensive parameter q to analyze the similarities and differences (variations) in the epidemiological data from across the world to COVID-19 data from China, where the first COVID-19 case in humans was reported in December 2019.The q-statistics was introduced by Tsallis, where parameter q represents the extent of non-extensivity of a distribution. It is used in the present study to generalize the typically used exponential function and deal with the issues, such as fluctuations due to non-ideal COVID-19 cases. Introducing a non-extensive parameter q, which indicates a shift in the behavior of the epidemic distribution, helped the researchers analyze scenarios where the classical statistics become inappropriate.The study model based the analysis of the COVID-19 disease outbreak evolution under different quarantine scenarios for several countries across the world. In particular, the research team obtained the infectious numbers of COVID-19 weekly from February to July 2021 for Japan, Australia, England, France, Canada, Germany, South Korea, and the United States (US); however, for England, they did the same analysis from January to July 2021 (used for comparisons).They simulated the evolution of the cumulative number of active infectious individuals as a function of time and compared it with real-time data from different countries.The study model predicted a secondary outbreak in April 2021, indicating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was active in spring, especially in England, that witnessed the highest surge in COVID-19 cases.Further, the study model showed that the mitigation, quarantining, and other COVID-19 prevention measures implemented by the government at the population level led to larger values of q, which reflected that these measures were effective.While analyzing the comparisons among various fitting parameters, the authors observed that all changeable fit parameters were not independent, especially the fit parameters with common properties, and the study model firmly supported this observation. Notably, while A reflected the peak value of study data sets, B and γ depicted epidemic data evolution pattern. More specifically, γ indicated the mean infectious time for an individual.In the case of the US and England, the weekly evolution of infectious individuals for COVID-19 steadily increased, indicating that these countries implemented fewer epidemic-control measures, especially England. The observed q value of 0.254 further supports this finding.Contrastingly, South Korea, Australia, Germany, and Canada, had almost similar q values as they had implemented similar COVID-19 containment measures.In Japan and France, the evolution of infectious COVID-19 individuals tended to stabilize with the highest observed q values of 1.99 and 1.98, respectively. Notably, governments in these two countries implemented agile and aggressive COVID-19 mitigation strategies, especially the France government.However, Japan implemented occasion augmentation, isolation, and hospitalization during the 32nd Olympic Games, leading to the highest observed value of q-parameter in the present study.The study model emerged as an alternative tool to investigate the global distribution of COVID-19 cases. Additionally, it could help resolve issues in the scientific works studying infectious diseases and outbreaks, such as COVID-19.Through data-fitting analysis, the non-extensive parameter q remarkably accounted for the external (societal and state-level interferences) and internal interactions at play in the system of epidemic transmission. Further investigating the physics of the Tsallis parameter q and other fitting parameters, including A, B, and γ (used in the current study) could help predict future epidemic transmission.Future studies should comprehensively analyze how the study parameters impacted the COVID-19 epidemic transmission.

More info.INTEGRA Biosciences’ ASSIST PLUS pipetting robot is helping the Arbovirus Testing Lab at the New Hampshire Public Health Laboratories in Concord, USA, to streamline sample pooling for West Nile and Eastern equine encephalitis virus testing.Laboratory supervisor Denise Bolton explained: “We adopted pooled testing in summer 2020, initially constructing the sample pools manually. However, the additional step complicated the workflow, required high levels of concentration and focus, and occupied over an hour of analyst time. Adding a manual pooling step was also quite risky from a quality standpoint, and we worried about the opportunity for analyst error.”We were already familiar with the ASSIST PLUS system, as we use it for our COVID-19 samples. It was easy to write a pooling program using the VIALAB software, and the flexibility of the 8 channel VOYAGER adjustable tip spacing pipette meant that there was no need to change our mosquito processing method. We use the platform to transfer aliquots from 2 ml tubes into a 96 well plate to create the sample pools, then add lysis buffer directly, using the entire pool for nucleic acid extraction. This streamlines the process, saving time and reducing the use of plastic labware, since we aren t constructing high volume pools then transferring an aliquot for extraction. We have seen a 75% saving in extraction and PCR reagents, and reduced the use of PCR instrumentation for the surveillance program, as well as saving precious analyst time. Most importantly, we have confidence that the most complex step in the process is being performed without errors.”Denise Bolton, Laboratory SupervisorINTEGRA BiosciencesPosted in: Device / Technology News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: 96 Well Plate, Arbovirus, covid-19, Encephalitis, Laboratory, Mosquito, Nucleic Acid, Pipetting, Public Health, Reagents, VirusPlease use one of the following formats to cite this article in your essay, paper or report:APAINTEGRA Biosciences.

		<title>Study reveals new opportunities for using small molecule drugs to target KRAS mutants</title>
		<description>Research published today in Nature Chemical Biology reveals new opportunities for using small molecule drugs to target KRAS, the most commonly mutated protein in cancer.</description>
		<text>We use cookies to enhance your experience. By continuing to browse this site you agree to our use of cookies. More info.Research published today in Nature Chemical Biology reveals new opportunities for using small molecule drugs to target KRAS, the most commonly mutated protein in cancer. Promega research scientists collaborated with the University of California – San Francisco research group led by Dr. Kevan M. Shokat, a global leader in KRAS biology, to study the binding of potentially therapeutic molecules to common mutants of the KRAS protein. This study represents the first observation and quantification of direct target engagement of KRAS(G12D) and other hotspot oncogenic mutants of KRAS in cells using reversible binders.KRAS is a protein that serves as a “master switch” for regulating cell proliferation. It is the most commonly mutated protein in cancer. KRAS was long considered to be “undruggable” until 2013 when the Shokat lab identified covalent drugs targeting KRAS(G12C), a common mutant in which a glycine amino acid is changed to a cysteine. That discovery led to increased drug discovery research, and eventually the first inhibitors targeting KRAS(G12C).Unfortunately, other mutants of KRAS presented different challenges. All of the known inhibitors of KRAS(G12C) relied on an inactive state of the protein that other mutants do not frequently exhibit. The G12C mutation also provided the opportunity to employ covalent drug discovery methods that would not apply to other hotspot mutants. For those reasons, alleles such as KRAS(G12D) and KRAS(G12V) continued to be considered undruggable.The research published today in Nature Chemical Biology utilized a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assay to quantify target engagement of RAS complexes in live cells. They found that the switch-II pocket of KRAS was a privileged drug binding site for non-covalent ligands, and that this was not dependent on the activation state of KRAS. These results open new opportunities for targeting non-G12C mutants of KRAS in drug discovery.“We’ve shown that some of these highly aggressive mutants are indeed vulnerable to small molecule inhibitors,” says Matt Robers, Senior Research Scientist at Promega.With our new target engagement method, we can measure binding within living cells and show that the binding we see at these hotspot mutants actually translates into anti-proliferative effects in the pancreatic cancer lineages.”Matt Robers, Senior Research Scientist, PromegaIn addition to the BRET methods for measuring target engagement, the paper also describes nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methods for observing reversible ligand binding in vitro and determining the state of the KRAS protein. The authors hope that the methods they describe will be a valuable tool for researchers to develop treatments for some of the most aggressive KRAS mutants previously thought to be “undruggable.”Promega offers a comprehensive selection of tools to accelerate RAS pathway drug discovery based on a sensitive bioluminescence platform.Promega CorporationPosted in: Drug Discovery   Pharmaceuticals | Cell Biology | BiochemistryTags: Amino Acid, Assay, Bioluminescence, BRET, Cancer, Cell, Cell Proliferation, Cysteine, Drug Discovery, Drugs, Glycine, in vitro, Ligand, Living Cells, Molecule, Mutation, Pancreatic Cancer, Proliferation, Protein, Research, SpectroscopyCancel reply to commentSonia PonzoIn this interview, we speak to Sonia Ponzo, the Director of Science at Flo Health, about their app and how it s revolutionizing the field of women s health.Linda Boekestijn, Dr. Glauco SouzaIn this interview, News-Medical talks to Dr. Glauco Souza and Linda Boekestijn about their work in the wound healing space and how they devised a new high throughput 3D model for would healing.Dr. Amy Gelmi and Professor Leslie YeoIn this interview, we speak to Dr. Amy Gelmi and Professor Leslie Yeo about their new research that looked at using sound waves to regrow bones.

		<title>UEA research reveals the lasting impact of Covid lockdowns on people’s mental, physical health</title>
		<description>New research from the University of East Anglia reveals first-hand the lasting impact that lockdowns may have had on people’s mental and physical health.</description>
		<text>We use cookies to enhance your experience. By continuing to browse this site you agree to our use of cookies. More info.New research from the University of East Anglia reveals first-hand the lasting impact that lockdowns may have had on people’s mental and physical health.The UK’s first Covid lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson exactly two years ago today.Just a few days later, researchers at UEA launched a major project to track the mental and physical health of the nation through lockdowns and beyond.More than 1,000 participants carried out daily surveys – with questions on a range of lifestyle behaviors including physical activity, diet, sleep, smoking, drinking, and drug use.Some of the participants were then interviewed by the research team, to try to understand what was happening for people from their own viewpoints.New findings published today show how people responded very differently to social restrictions depending on their existing circumstances.For those who were less well-off to start with, adapting to lockdown was more difficult, and health behaviors typically worsened to a greater extent.In contrast, those who were better off at the start of the pandemic demonstrated faster adaptation and were more able to respond positively to restrictions, for example by taking to online exercise classes.It is likely that any lasting impact to mental and physical health will therefore be much greater for those who were worse off to start with.Those with good social links and healthy behaviors already in place described in their interviews how they were able to adapt to lockdown and thrive, whereas some of the more vulnerable in our communities had fallen into unhealthy spirals.Prof Caitlin Notley said: “When the first lockdown was announced back in 2020, we started surveying participants from around the UK daily. Our initial results showed that people were eating less fruit and veg, getting less exercise and drinking more alcohol.“It quickly became apparent that lockdown may have lasting consequences for the physical and mental health of the nation.“We wanted to see whether people’s lifestyles changed in the long-term so we continued the study by carrying out regular surveys with the participants, and interviewing some people to find out more.”Now, two years on, the team’s results show how health inequalities are likely to have widened.Prof Notley said: “Social restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic have had a significant impact on health behaviors at the individual and population level.“It’s fair to say that all of our participants’ lives were disrupted by lockdown and they were forced to adapt.“But people responded to the lockdowns very differently and their experiences of social restrictions varied considerably.“Fundamentally, people were hindered or helped by their existing support structures and resources, such as access to technology to engage with the outside world, or private outdoor space.“Those people who had good friends, community links and who were already health conscious, were able to respond positively and better able to cope.“They were able to adapt to the ‘new normal’, use technology to keep in touch with friends and relatives, order veg boxes, carry on with a healthy diet and take part in healthy pursuits in new and innovative ways such as online fitness classes or ‘doing Joe Wicks’.“But lockdowns are very likely to have caused a sustained widening of social and health inequalities.“Those who remained in work outside the home, or who were retired, were the least impacted overall. But those who were unemployed, younger, on a lower income, clinically unwell or told to fully shield were particularly impacted by strict restrictions.“For these more vulnerable people, supportive social factors were taken away or severely restricted. Anxiety and depression worsened, and unhealthy behaviors like exercising less, drinking more alcohol, and eating a poor diet increased.“As we work through the ‘roadmap to recovery’, emphasis needs to be placed on a collaborative, community-based approach, with a focus on what makes us well. Encouraging membership of community exercise groups, for example, may help those most impacted to engage again with healthy behaviors to keep them well. We also need to pay attention to how those who are less well-off responded more negatively to the policy of lockdown, so that lessons can be learnt for the future.Prof Caitlin Notley‘Disruption and adaptation in response to the coronavirus pandemic – assets as contextual moderators of enactment of health behaviors’ is published in the British Journal of Health Psychology.University of East AngliaPosted in: Medical Research News | Healthcare NewsTags: Alcohol, Anxiety, Coronavirus, Depression, Diet, Exercise, Fruit, Mental Health, Pandemic, Physical Activity, Psychology, Research, Sleep, SmokingCancel reply to commentSonia PonzoIn this interview, we speak to Sonia Ponzo, the Director of Science at Flo Health, about their app and how it s revolutionizing the field of women s health.Linda Boekestijn, Dr. Glauco SouzaIn this interview, News-Medical talks to Dr. Glauco Souza and Linda Boekestijn about their work in the wound healing space and how they devised a new high throughput 3D model for would healing.Dr. Amy Gelmi and Professor Leslie YeoIn this interview, we speak to Dr. Amy Gelmi and Professor Leslie Yeo about their new research that looked at using sound waves to regrow bones.

		<title>New York Blood Center and Columbia University partner to advance the use of mRNA technology in HIV vaccine study</title>
		<description>New York Blood Center’s Project ACHIEVE and Columbia University’s Columbia Research Unit are working in partnership for the New York City effort to advance the use of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology in an HIV preventive vaccine study – HVTN 302.</description>
		<text>We use cookies to enhance your experience. By continuing to browse this site you agree to our use of cookies. More info.New York Blood Center’s Project ACHIEVE and Columbia University’s Columbia Research Unit are working in partnership for the New York City effort to advance the use of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology in an HIV preventive vaccine study – HVTN 302. The global research effort is sponsored by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), headquartered at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health, and sponsored by NIAID.The Phase 1 trial, titled HVTN 302, is the second trial of its kind and will be enrolling up to 108 people across 10 sites in the United States to test 3 different experimental vaccines against HIV using the mRNA vaccine technology that has been successful in fighting COVID-19. The vaccines are experimental, meaning that they have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Researchers will study the safety of and immune responses to the different vaccines, focusing on which might be the best vaccine candidate as well as what might be the best dosage.  Both organizations have an extensive history of conducting research spanning all phases of HIV vaccine clinical research. They have conducted longstanding work in community engagement and recruitment throughout New York City, developing a reputation for enrolling a diverse pool of study participants and addressing mistrust in vaccine trials among racial, ethnic, and sexual minority communities.“Seeing the first participant in HVTN 302 receive their initial injection of the study vaccine at our clinic site provides me hope that we can make a major contribution to the scientific community’s goal to prevent the spread of HIV. Globally more than thirty-seven million people are living with HIV. There have been major advances in HIV prevention, care, and treatment, but a vaccine will impact the broadest segment of society. We’re looking forward to applying what we learned from the COVID-19 vaccine trials to our research on this potentially groundbreaking vaccine,” stated Hong Van Tieu, MD, MS, Head, Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention, LFKRI, New York Blood Center’s Project ACHIEVE.We are immensely excited to be working on this significant advancement in HIV vaccine research. We have been studying various HIV vaccine products for decades and the science continues to progress. The major advancements in COVID-19 vaccine development involved the use of the mRNA technology. Applying this technology to the realm of HIV vaccine research is a major turning point. Community members in New York City continue to enroll in this study which will help further the global effort to develop an HIV preventive vaccine.”Magda Sobieszczyk, MD, MPH, Principal Investigator, Columbia University’s Columbia Research UnitThe HVTN 302 trial is evaluating three experimental vaccines; each participant in the trial will get one of the vaccines, all of which use mRNA technology. The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) on behalf of Scripps Consortium provides these study vaccines, developed by researchers at Scripps Research, for the study for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development (CHAVD).These study vaccines are manufactured using mRNA technology, a piece of genetic code carried into your body by the vaccine as a message with instructions. The mRNA technology was developed by Moderna for the COVID-19 vaccine, which instructs the body’s cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Instead of showing the immune system pieces of HIV, the study vaccines carry instructions that show human muscle cells how to make small pieces that resemble parts of HIV but are not actual pieces of the virus. Therefore, participants cannot get HIV from the vaccines.When people get a vaccine injection in the muscle of their arm, the cells in that muscle will get the instructions and start to make the different types of HIV pieces and display these pieces on the surface of the muscle cell. The immune system will then be able to see these HIV pieces and learn how to recognize them.Researchers hope that the immune system will respond by making antibodies and T-cells that could fight HIV if a person is ever exposed to the virus in the future.The mRNA instructions do their work in the part of the muscle cell called the cytoplasm and only remain in the body for a couple of days before they break down naturally. The mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cells, which is where human DNA is located. Therefore, the mRNA cannot interact with human DNA.The study vaccines have not been given to people before. Prior research in animals was promising and found to be safe. The HVTN 302 trial is conducted in a way in which safety is carefully monitored.The process is simple: participants indicate that they are interested, they complete an online screener, and staff contact them to complete a pre-screen over the phone. They then schedule their first study visit, where the participant receives more information on the study, signs consent forms and undergoes a physical exam. After that, if the participant is approved for the study, they are scheduled for their first vaccination.Project ACHIEVE and Columbia University are appealing to community members to screen for and join the HVTN 302 trial. As with recent advances in the COVID-19 vaccine development, study participants are essential in furthering the science. Tens of thousands of people have participated in the studies that led to the development of the lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines. As with the COVID-19 vaccine trials, Project ACHIEVE and Columbia University highly encourage those from racial, ethnic and sexual minority communities to participate in the study, as a diverse pool of participants is essential in the success of the study.New York Blood CenterPosted in: Medical Research News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: AIDS, Allergy, Antibodies, Blood, Cancer, Cell, covid-19, Cytoplasm, DNA, Food, Genetic, HIV, HIV/AIDS, Immune System, Infectious Diseases, Laboratory, Muscle, Protein, Research, Ribonucleic Acid, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Spike Protein, Vaccine, VirusCancel reply to commentSonia PonzoIn this interview, we speak to Sonia Ponzo, the Director of Science at Flo Health, about their app and how it s revolutionizing the field of women s health.Linda Boekestijn, Dr. Glauco SouzaIn this interview, News-Medical talks to Dr. Glauco Souza and Linda Boekestijn about their work in the wound healing space and how they devised a new high throughput 3D model for would healing.Dr. Amy Gelmi and Professor Leslie YeoIn this interview, we speak to Dr. Amy Gelmi and Professor Leslie Yeo about their new research that looked at using sound waves to regrow bones.

		<title>Study shows link between psychotropic medication use and post-Covid dementia</title>
		<description>Recent studies have highlighted the connection between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and the development of dementia.</description>
		<text>We use cookies to enhance your experience. By continuing to browse this site you agree to our use of cookies. More info.Recent studies have highlighted the connection between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and the development of dementia. To identify additional factors putting individuals in danger for developing brain impairment, researchers from The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research conducted a first-of-its-kind study that shows a link between the use of psychotropic medication before COVID-19 and post-COVID dementia in older adults (age 65 and older).These findings emphasize the important relationship between preexisting neuropsychiatric conditions, psychotropic medication and post-COVID dementia and may help shed light on future preventative strategies for dementia, an increasingly common and devastating disease. The research, published in Frontiers in Medicine, looked at the electronic health records (EHR) of 1,755 older adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at Northwell Health, the largest health system in New York State, between March 1 and April 20, 2020.A striking 12.7 percent of patients (223) developed dementia within one year of follow-up. Of the 1,755 patients studied, 25 percent (438) were exposed to at least one psychotropic before their COVID diagnosis. Patients who were exposed to a psychotropic medication prior to their COVID diagnosis were almost three times more likely to develop dementia (24 percent vs. 9 percent).“COVID-19 can have a profound, lingering effect on a person s physical and mental health, particularly in older adults,” said Liron Sinvani, MD, assistant professor in the Institute of Health System Science at the Feinstein Institutes and the senior author of the paper.We know that pre-existing psychiatric illness is associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes, but our study is the first to show an association with certain psychiatric medications and dementia.”Liron Sinvani, MD, Assistant Professor, Institute of Health System Science, Feinstein InstitutesThe medications used by the patients were classified as antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines (for stress/anxiety), mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants and anti-Parkinson disease medications. The research found that antipsychotic medications and mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants were associated with more than a two-fold increased risk of incident post-COVID dementia. Also noted in the paper, delirium during COVID-19 admission was associated with a two-fold increased risk of post-COVID dementia.“This research shows that psychotropic medications can be considered a predictive risk marker for post-COVID dementia. In patients taking psychotropic medications, COVID-19 could have accelerated progression of dementia after hospitalization,” said Yun Freudenberg-Hua, MD, associate professor in the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry of Northwell Health and in Institute of Molecular Medicine at the Feinstein Institutes, who is also first author on the paper. “It is important to note that this study is no way recommending people should stop taking antipsychotics, but simply that clinicians need to factor in a patient’s medication history while considering post-COVID after effects.”This study was done in collaboration with Northwell s Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine. They assembled a research workgroup to focus on COVID-19 and its impact on geriatric patients during the pandemic. The Older Adult COVID Workgroup is part of the Collaboration of Aging and Advanced Illness Research and Education, a research arm which sits within the Department of Medicine. Their work aims to examine geriatrics-relevant factors that significantly impact decisions around medical care and response to treatments. In 2021, the research team published a study in the Journal of Gerontology, which identified older adults presenting to the hospital with atypical COVID-19 symptoms, such as functional decline and altered mental status.“Dr. Sinvani and her team continue to shed new light on the impact COVID-19 has on older adults,  said Kevin J. Tracey, MD, president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes.

		<title>Groundbreaking chemical technique could reveal new treatments for cancer and other diseases</title>
		<description>Leicester researchers have described application of a pioneering chemical technique which could unlock ground-breaking new treatments for cancer and other diseases.</description>
		<text>We use cookies to enhance your experience. By continuing to browse this site you agree to our use of cookies. More info.Leicester researchers have described application of a pioneering chemical technique which could unlock ground-breaking new treatments for cancer and other diseases.Members of the Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, based at the University of Leicester, used proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as a ‘bridge’ to degrade proteins implicated in cancer.Scientists can manipulate the effectiveness of treatments by making changes to elements of this PROTAC bridge.This new study, published this week in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, describes how Leicester researchers applied a previously-described protein degradation technique known as PROTACs to degrade histone deacetylation enzymes (HDACs) in a more targeted way than ever before.HDACs play an important role in gene regulation, in which genes are switched ‘on’ and ‘off’, and are associated with a range of diseases, including cancer as well as various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease.Using this pioneering technique to target specific structures within cancerous cells could increase the potency and selectivity of new and existing drugs, meaning patients would require lower systemic exposure to drug treatments leading to a reduction in harmful side-effects to patients.The group have been granted a patent by the European Patent Office for the pioneering technique.Dr James Hodgkinson is an Associate Professor in Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology at the University of Leicester and one of the corresponding authors for the study.We are really excited about what these new molecules are capable of in cancer cells and their potential future development into medicines. Our next steps will involve optimizing their chemical structure and biological properties so that one day they could be used to improve the lives of cancer patients.”Dr James Hodgkinson, Associate Professor in Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology, University of LeicesterJohn Schwabe is Professor of Structural Biology and Director of the Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, and also a corresponding author on the study.

More info.Results from a major study into the effectiveness of a community-based group exercise program designed for people aged 65 and over with mobility limitations shows that REACT prevents physical decline and is cost-effective to run. The team behind it say it should be rolled out nationwide.A decline in mobility associated with aging can greatly reduce quality of life, lead to loss of independence, generate substantial health and social care costs, and reduce overall life expectancy. Pressure on healthcare systems is set to be exacerbated by the rapid expansion of the older population. Currently, three in 10 people of state pension age are classified as disabled due to mobility limitations.REACT – otherwise known as the REtirement in ACTion program – is an innovative, behavior change intervention targeted specifically at older adults who are beginning to experience mobility limitations (e.g., those who are beginning to find climbing upstairs, walking to the shop, or getting up from a chair more of a challenge). It aims to prevent further decline in mobility through exercises that target lower limb strength, balance, and stamina.The program focuses on fun, social interaction and building a community through the group-based sessions whilst providing accessible strength, balance, mobility, and cardio-vascular exercises tailored to each participant s needs.Based on results from a large, randomized control trial, the international research team from the universities of Bath, Birmingham, Exeter, and the University of the West of England (UWE) (UK) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine and Wake Forest (US) say that REACT can help older people avoid a downward spiral of declining mobility, which can accelerate and lead to social isolation and loss of independence.Funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) – Public Health Research program, REACT ran across three sites (Bath / Bristol, Birmingham, and Devon) over four and a half years. It involved 777 participants aged 65 and over (the oldest participant was 98). Participants were split into either an intervention or a control group.Those in the intervention group attended REACT twice a week for three months and then once a week for a further nine months. Those in the control group attended three separate  healthy ageing  classes over the course of the year. By comparing the two groups, researchers were able to test the effectiveness of REACT on lower limb mobility, as well as looking at health and social care usage.Their results, which are published today [Monday 21 March 2022 – 23.30] in two papers in the Lancet Public Health, show that:Physical activity carries a wide range of benefits for older people including a longer and healthier life, prolonged independence and autonomy, better mobility and improved wellbeing. Yet, many older people face a downward spiral of declining mobility, whereby the less active they are, the more limited they become. Afroditi Stathi, Professor and REACT Chief Investigator from the University of Birmingham Through REACT we have shown that this steady decline is avoidable. It can be prevented, or in many cases be reversed through an exercise program that is individually tailored and progressive. At least one REACT exercise session per week seems sufficient to provide clinically meaningful benefits on lower limb physical function and it is highly cost-effective. This is a strong public health message to give to older adults, both in the UK and around the world. Bath-based REACT participant, Mr Fayek Osman, aged 74, said:  The program improved my wellbeing as my walking ability and stair climbing are improving. REACT has been of great benefit to me and encouraged me to continue with advanced level of activities. It also strengthens my belief that some exercise is better than nothing at all. Dr Tristan Snowsill of the University of Exeter, who examined the economic data from the study with Professor Antonieta Medina-Lara, said:  We found clear evidence that quality of life was improved in the REACT group. This alone would most likely have been enough to justify the cost of the program using the standard rule for cost-effectiveness. To also find that REACT participants used fewer health and care services makes the REACT program one of the clearest cases of value for money I have come across. The team now hope REACT can be rolled out nationwide via community activity providers based in local areas.Dr Max Western of the University of Bath s Department for Health explained:  The aim of REACT was always to have real impacts on people s lives. Given these significant results we are calling on healthcare professionals and policymakers to draw on our findings and implement similar REACT sessions in other parts of the country. Our studies show just how effective REACT can be; we hope many more people will soon be able to benefit from it in the way our participants did.  Dr Janet Withall, of the University of Birmingham, is the REACT Trial Manager. She added:  We would like to thank all 777 REACT participants who contributed their time and enthusiasm, and without whom the study would not have been possible. We also could not have conducted the REACT study without all our delivery partners who supported us with their time, resources and expertise.

		<title>Scientists Described a Dinosaur s Butthole in Exquisite Detail</title>
		<description> img alt=   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2021-01/processed/dinobutt_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p Uncharted territory. /p </description>
		<text>When a dog-sized Psittacosaurus was living out its days on Earth, it was probably concerned with mating, eating, and not being killed by other dinosaurs. It would never even have crossed its mind that, 120 million or so years later, scientists would be peering intensely up its clacker.However, that s precisely what scientists did, publishing in 2021 an exquisitely detailed description of a non-avian dinosaur s cloaca: the catch-all hole used for peeing, pooping, mating, and laying eggs.This Swiss Army knife of buttholes is common throughout the animal kingdom today – all birds, amphibians, reptiles, and even a few mammals possess a cloaca. But we know little about the cloacae of dinosaurs, including their anatomy, what they looked like, and how the animals used them. I noticed the cloaca several years ago after we had reconstructed the color patterns of this dinosaur using a remarkable fossil on display at the Senckenberg Museum in Germany which clearly preserves its skin and color patterns,  paleobiologist Jakob Vinther of the University of Bristol in the UK explained last year. It took a long while before we got around to finish it off because no one has ever cared about comparing the exterior of cloacal openings of living animals, so it was largely uncharted territory. The Psittacosaurus specimen. (Vinther et al., Current Biology, 2020)So that s what the team did, comparing the fossilized cloaca to modern cloacae.Their specimen was the only non-avian dinosaur fossil known to have a preserved cloaca, but due to the way the fossil was positioned, the internal anatomy of this opening has not been preserved; only the external vent is visible. This means there was a lot of information the researchers couldn t gauge. We found the vent does look different in many different groups of tetrapods, but in most cases it doesn t tell you much about an animal s sex,  said anatomist and animal reproductive system expert Diane Kelly of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Those distinguishing features are tucked inside the cloaca, and unfortunately, they re not preserved in this fossil. Even so, that exterior anatomy could contain some pretty interesting clues as to what some dinosaur cloacae looked like, and how they were used.Although the dinosaur s cloaca is unlike any other known modern animal, the team was able to identify several features in common with crocodilian reptiles, such as alligators and crocodiles, and birds.There was a dorsal lobe that seemed similar to the cloacal protuberance seen in birds – a rounded swelling near the cloaca during breeding season, where the male stores sperm – although, again, without the internal anatomy, it s impossible to say for sure.Secondly, the cloaca had lateral lips on either side of the opening, much like those of crocodilians. Unlike crocodilians however, Psittacosaurus had them arranged in a V-shape, thus the opening could have been slit-shaped; it also could have been round, like in birds.(Jakob Vinther, University of Bristol and Bob Nicholls/Paleocreations.com 2020)Above: The cloacal vent, and how it might once have looked.Other features, however, were also similar to crocodilians. The cloacal lips were covered in small, overlapping scales and heavily pigmented with melanin. In crocodilians, these lobes function as musky scent glands that are used during social displays – a function, the researchers said, that would be supported by the heavy pigmentation. As a paleoartist, it has been absolutely amazing to have an opportunity to reconstruct one of the last remaining features we didn t know anything about in dinosaurs,  said paleoartist Robert Nicholls. Knowing that at least some dinosaurs were signaling to each other gives paleoartists exciting freedom to speculate on a whole variety of now plausible interactions during dinosaur courtship. It is a game changer! Because only one fossilized cloaca has been recorded, it s impossible to tell whether the display may have been sexual, and whether the fossilized dinosaur is male or female. But the colorful lobes could hint at the shared ancestry between birds and non-avian dinosaurs, the researchers noted in their paper.Comparison of different cloacae. (Vinther et al., Current Biology, 2020)For lack of samples, this is a very understudied region of dinosaur anatomy, and only by examining a wide range of dinosaur cloacae can we learn more about how they functioned in the social and reproductive lives of these ancient animals.No doubt, other paleontologists are on the lookout for fossilized buttholes to try to fill this gap in our understanding of dinosaur life.The research was published in Current Biology.An earlier version of this article was published in January 2021.</text>

		<title>Fish Appear to Be Losing Their Color as Coral Reefs Decline, Scientists Warn</title>
		<description> img alt=   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/ClownFishOnCoralReef_1_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p A pale new world. /p </description>
		<text>Fish communities on Australia s famed Great Barrier Reef may become less colorful as oceans warm and corals bleach, according to a new Australian study that looked at changes in reef health, coral types, and resident fish over three decades.    Future reefs may not be the colorful ecosystems we recognize today,  write marine ecologist Chris Hemingson and his James Cook University colleagues in their paper, published in Global Change Biology. Our findings suggest that reefs may be at a critical transition point and might be poised to become much less colorful in the coming years. The study, which comes weeks after the Great Barrier Reef was struck by another widespread bleaching event fueled by rising carbon emissions, focused on reefs surrounding Orpheus Island, which is located in the mid-section of the largest coral reef system on Earth.Previous coral bleaching events have profoundly changed the make-up of coral reefs in the area, with the loss of soft and branching corals a likely factor in the disappearance of brightly-colored fish, which are becoming increasingly rare, the study found.   As these complex corals become rarer, on future reefs impacted by climate change, fish communities may become duller,  the trio of researchers writes on their group s website.To investigate, Hemingson and colleagues looked at the diversity of colors found in communities of reef fishes and related that to the types of habitats where those fishes live.  Whether fishes evolved bright colors to stand out and attract a mate or neutral tones to blend in and avoid predators, their coloration is naturally linked to the coral reefs they inhabit.Fish communities in healthy parts of the reef with plentiful complex corals were compared to other areas where massive, encrusted corals dominate in the wake of major disturbances, such as heatwaves and cyclones, and degraded reefs with few corals smothered in algae. We found that as the cover of structurally complex corals increases on a reef, so does the diversity and range of colors present on fishes living in and around them,  says Hemingson, who focused on small fishes that rarely venture far from their home patch of reef. But, as the cover of turf algae and dead coral rubble increases, the diversity of colors declines to a more generalized, uniform appearance. (Hemingson et al., Global Change Biology, 2022)Above: Fish communities in healthy (a) and damaged (b) parts of the reef.This doesn t bode well for reef fishes in warming waters, so Hemingson and colleagues looked back at data collected annually for the past 27 years on fish communities inhabiting reefs around Orpheus Island, to see whether the trends held true over time.We know from other previous studies that just 2 percent of the Great Barrier Reef remains untouched by the five mass coral bleaching events of the past 30 years – a truly horrific toll of human-caused, emissions-driven marine heatwaves.The first recorded mass bleaching event of 1998 hit the reefs around Orpheus Island especially hard, damaging complex branching corals and leading to a  complete shift  in fish communities, Hemingson and colleagues found.The most eye-catching yellow and green fishes, such as the lemon damselfish and green coral goby, have declined in abundance in the three decades since, by about two-thirds. Ongoing declines (exacerbated by further disturbance events) are likely to lead to a complete loss of these brightly colored species,  which would effectively  drain  the color out of fish communities, making them dull and drab, Hemingson and his coral reef compadres write.Although the massive and encrusting boulder corals that replaced soft, branching corals are more resilient to heat impacts – literally hardening the reef to future stressors – they probably provide less protection from predators for brightly-colored fishes. Unfortunately, this means that the corals that are most capable of surviving the immediate impacts of climate change are unlikely to maintain the diversity of colors currently supported by coral reefs,  the researchers write. Fish communities on future reefs are therefore likely to be a duller version of their previous configurations, even if coral cover remains high. Hemingson acknowledges the grief that people may feel as fish species and corals are lost – an ecological grief that scientists studying coral reefs first-hand know all too well.But as scientists have shown with gusto, grief can be a powerful motivational force that spurs people to take action, too. I can either give up when I feel upset, or use those emotions to motivate me and find better solutions,  Emma Camp, a coral biologist at the University of Technology Sydney told Nature in 2019.Fighting words for us all to live by.The study was published in Global Change Biology.</text>

		<title>There s a Stunning Detail Lurking in Juno s Latest Pic of Jupiter</title>

		<text>The Juno probe has been tasked with studying a leviathan: Jupiter, the heavyweight of the Solar System, King of the Planets.But a planet the size of Jupiter, nearly 318 times the mass of Earth, isn t without its friends.The gas giant has 79 known moons (and possibly more unknown), one of them even bigger than Mercury. Juno is exploring the relationship between some of those moons and their host planet – and sometimes, seeing them show up photobombing pictures of the Big Jupe itself.The latest of these is so breathtaking, it almost looks like an artwork of science fiction. Jupiter looms large, its classic bands of roiling, swirling cloud and spot-like cyclones clearly visible on the southern hemisphere in the sunlight.(NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/AndreaLuck)To the right of the giant planet, two relatively small specks sail serenely against the inky darkness. These are two of Jupiter s four Galilean moons – the largest of its satellites, discovered by Galileo Galilei.The two pictured here are the smaller of the four: Io, with an equatorial diameter of 3,643.2 kilometers (2,264 miles); and Europa, with an equatorial diameter of 3,121.6 kilometers (1,940 miles).(NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/AndreaLuck)Each of these moons is a fascinating target for study in its own right. Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, speckled by over 400 active volcanoes on its surface. These are the result of internal gravitational stresses placed on the moon, not just by Jupiter, but by the three other Galilean moonsThis volcanic activity results in Io s atmosphere becoming rich in sulfur dioxide, spewed out by the volcanoes. That atmosphere constantly leaks, forming a plasma torus around Jupiter itself, which is channeled along magnetic fields lines to rain down onto Jupiter s poles, generating permanent aurorae.The constant spew of sulfur has also coated Io itself in various sulfur compounds, which give the moon its predominantly yellow hue.True-color image of Io. (NASA/JPL/University of Arizona)Europa, meanwhile, is the target of interest in the search for life outside Earth. Beneath its pale, icy shell lurks an interior liquid ocean. Although the moon is far from the Sun, it, too, may be internally heated by gravitational stress.If this is the case, then there may be hydrothermal vents at the floor of its global sea. Here on Earth, such vents are havens for food webs that rely not on photosynthesis, but chemosynthesis to survive: harnessing chemical reactions for food.This has led astrobiologists to believe that, of all the worlds in the Solar System, ice moons like Europa and Saturn s moon Enceladus may be the most likely places to find extraterrestrial life.Juno will be making close flybys of these two very different worlds.Europa, which is also the target of a dedicated mission scheduled for a 2024 launch, will be visited by the probe in September of this year. It will be the closest any probe has been to the moon in decades. Io, meanwhile, is scheduled for flybys in late 2023 and early 2024.You can download the full-size version of this image from the NASA website.</text>

		<title>Record-Smashing Heatwaves Are Hitting Antarctica And The Arctic at The Same Time</title>
		<description> img alt= Sunset reflection in Antarctic Sound, Antarctica.   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/AntarcticaSunset_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p What is going on? /p </description>
		<text>Record-breaking heatwaves hit both Antarctica and the Arctic simultaneously this week, with temperatures reaching 47°C and 30°C higher than normal.Heatwaves are bizarre at any time in Antarctica, but particularly now at the equinox as Antarctica is about to descend into winter darkness. Likewise, up north, the Arctic is just emerging from winter.Are these two heatwaves linked? We don t know yet, and it s most likely a coincidence. But we do know weather systems in Antarctica and the Arctic are connected to regions nearest to them, and these connections sometimes reach all the way to the tropics.And is climate change the cause? It might be. While it s too soon to say for sure, we do know climate change is making polar heatwaves more common and severe, and the poles are warming faster than the global average.So let s take a closer look at what s driving the extreme anomalies for each region, and the flow-on effects for polar wildlife like penguins and polar bears.Antarctica s heatwave was driven by a slow, intense high pressure system located southeast of Australia, which carried vast amounts of warm air and moisture deep into Antarctica s interior. It was coupled with a very intense low pressure system over the east Antarctic interior.To make matters worse, cloud cover over the Antarctic ice plateau trapped heat radiating from the surface.Since it s autumn in Antarctica, temperatures in the continent s interior weren t high enough to melt glaciers and the ice cap. But that s not to say large swings in temperature didn t occur.(ClimateReanalyzer.org)Above: Air temperature anomalies across Antarctica at 2 meters above the ground for 18 March 2022.For example, Vostok in the middle of the ice plateau hit a provisional high of -17.7°C (15°C higher than previous record of -32.6°C). Concordia, the Italian-French research station also on the high plateau, experienced its highest ever temperature for any month, which was about 40°C above the March average.The story is very different on the coast as rain fell, which isn t really common for the continent.The rain was driven primarily by an atmospheric river – a narrow band of moisture collected from warm oceans. Atmospheric rivers are found on the edge of low pressure systems and can move large amounts of water across vast distances, at scales greater than continents.Despite their rarity, atmospheric rivers make an important contribution to the continent s ice sheets, as they dump relatively large amounts of snow. When surface temperatures rise above freezing, rain rather than snow falls over Antarctica.Last Monday (March 14) air temperatures at the Australian Casey Station reached a maximum of -1.9°C. Two days later, they were more like mid-summer temperatures, reaching a new March maximum of 5.6°C, which will melt ice.This is the second heatwave at Casey Station in two years. In February 2020, Casey hit 9.2°C, followed by a shocking high of 18.3°C on the Antarctic Peninsula.So what might this mean for wildlife?Adélie penguins, which live across the entire Antarctic coastline, have recently finished their summer breeding. But thankfully, the Adélie penguin chicks had already left for sea to start hunting for food on their own, so the heatwave did not impact them.The rain may have affected the local plant life, such as mosses, especially as they were in their annual phase of drying out for the winter. But we won t know if there s any damage to the plants until next summer when we can visit the moss beds again.A similar weather pattern occurred last week in the Arctic. An intense low pressure system began forming off the north-east coast of the United States. An atmospheric river formed at its junction with an adjacent high pressure system.This weather pattern funneled warm air into the Arctic circle. Svalbald, in Norway, recorded a new maximum temperature of 3.9°C.US researchers called the low pressure system a  bomb cyclone  because it formed so rapidly, undergoing the delightfully termed  bombogenesis .(ClimateReanalyzer.org)Above: Arctic air temperature anomalies at 2 meters above the ground for 17 March 2022.Winter sea ice conditions this year were already very low, and on land there was recent record-breaking rain across Greenland.If the warm conditions cause sea ice to break up earlier than normal, it could have dire impacts for many animals. For example, sea ice is a crucial habitat for polar bears, enabling them to hunt seals and travel long distances.Many people live in the Arctic, including Arctic Indigenous people, and we know losing sea ice disrupts subsistence hunting and cultural practices.What s more, the bomb cyclone weather system brought chaotic weather to many populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere. In northern Norway, for instance, flowers have began blooming early due to three weeks of abnormally warm weather.Modelling suggests large-scale climate patterns are become more variable. This means this seemingly one-off heatwave may be a harbinger for the future under climate change.In particular, the Arctic has been warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. This is because the melting sea ice reveals more ocean beneath, and the ocean absorbs more heat as it s darker.In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects Arctic sea ice to continue its current retreat, with ice-free summers possible by the 2050s.Antarctica s future looks similarly concerning. The IPCC finds global warming between 2 and 3°C this century would see the West Antarctic Ice Sheet almost completely lost. Bringing global emissions down to net zero as fast as possible will help avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Dana M Bergstrom, Principal Research Scientist, University of Wollongong; Sharon Robinson, Professor, University of Wollongong, and Simon Alexander, Atmospheric scientist, University of Tasmania.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

		<title>World Happiness Report Reveals an Inspiring Benefit That Came Out of The Pandemic</title>
		<description> img alt=   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/Volunteering_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p There s reason for hope. /p </description>
		<text>Amid the pandemic and other struggles that have affected most people on Earth in recent years, there are some bright spots of hope to be found – at least according to the new World Happiness Report 2022 just published by researchers and experts.The report is put together by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, using data from the Gallup World Poll. This year s report, the tenth anniversary of the survey, collected responses from approximately 1,000 respondents in each of the 156 countries that participate.While the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak have undoubtedly brought pain and suffering to many, there has also been an increase in support that people show for each other, and in expressions of benevolence, the study authors report. We found during 2021 remarkable worldwide growth in all three acts of kindness monitored in the Gallup World Poll,  says economist John Helliwell from the University of British Columbia in Canada. Helping strangers, volunteering, and donations in 2021 were strongly up in every part of the world, reaching levels almost 25 percent above their pre-pandemic prevalence. With disease and war continuing to impact wellbeing (the data here was collected before the conflict between Russia and Ukraine), it s a reminder that there is still hope for humanity – that in times of trial we can come together. This surge of benevolence, which was especially great for the helping of strangers, provides powerful evidence that people respond to help others in need, creating in the process more happiness for the beneficiaries, good examples for others to follow, and better lives for themselves,  Helliwell says.In terms of individual countries, the people of Finland were ranked as the happiest in 2022 – the fifth year in a row the nation has held the top spot. Denmark came in second, with Iceland, Switzerland and the Netherlands rounding out the top five.The team behind the report suggests high trust, social cohesion, a good work-life balance, and free education and healthcare are the key reasons why the Scandinavian countries rank highly in the report every year.While the positioning hasn t shifted much from last year, the biggest gains in happiness were seen in Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania. The biggest drops in happiness scores were observed in Lebanon and Venezuela, and in Afghanistan, where life continues to be difficult for many since the Taliban regained control in August 2021. At the very bottom of the ranking we find societies that suffer from conflict and extreme poverty,  says economist Jan-Emmanuel De Neve from the University of Oxford in the UK. Notably we find that people in Afghanistan evaluate the quality of their own lives as merely 2.4 out of 10. This presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims and the fundamental importance of peace and stability for human wellbeing. Stress, worry, and sadness have increased overall, the researchers report, with the pandemic in particular having a  tangible impact  on lives and happiness. Future concerns are likely to focus around war, rises in the cost of living, and the shifts happening due to the climate crisis.Different attitudes are revealed in different age groups. Among the young, for example, life satisfaction has fallen – but it has also risen in the over-60s. However, overall there has been a slight long-term decline in the enjoyment of life in most countries.The World Happiness Report is intended to promote happiness and wellbeing as well as report on it. While researchers continue to discover new insights into what makes us happy, our happiness or lack of it still depends largely on environmental factors and what s going on around us.While conflict, disease, poverty, and inequality continue to be major problems in 2022, the researchers suggest there s plenty of potential for taking better care of ourselves, whether that s at the level of governments or individual actions. Acts of kindness and generosity can help us cope in difficult times by giving us a sense of purpose, something practical to focus on and showing the strength of the human spirit,  explains Mark Williamson, CEO of the charity Action for Happiness. We can build good mental health by taking positive action to help others.  To see the report in full, check out the World Happiness Report website.</text>

		<title>MDMA Shows Promising Results in Phase 3 Clinical Trial For PTSD Treatment</title>
		<description> img alt=   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/CloseUpPinkTabletsWithLetterEOnThem_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p The evidence is in. /p </description>
		<text>In recent years, scientists have found that psychoactive drugs such as MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, and ketamine show promise in treating various mental health issues. Now, MDMA-assisted therapy has shown more promising results in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).In findings presented at the American Chemical Society s (ACS) Spring Meeting for 2022, researchers report on follow-up results from a phase 3 clinical trial last year where MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy), coupled with therapy, was tested for the treatment of PTSD.The data indicate therapy has been effective even in hard-to-treat patients, such as those with drug or alcohol use disorders.  MDMA is really interesting because it s an empathogen,  says neuroscientist Jennifer Mitchell from the University of California, San Francisco.  It causes the release of oxytocin in the brain, which creates feelings of trust and closeness that can really help in a therapeutic setting. Researchers enrolled 90 participants with severe PTSD, a condition characterized by amnesia, flashbacks, and nightmares relating to a past traumatic event, in the first phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of MDMA-assisted therapy for treatment of this disorder. Previous phase 2 studies determined optimal dosages of the drug, while the phase 3 trial focused on participants attending an eight-hour therapy session after receiving their dose. Participants then received two MDMA-assisted therapy sessions a month apart, in addition to weekly therapy. In follow-ups two months after their final MDMA-assisted therapy session, around two thirds of participants no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Conversely, only one-third of participants in the placebo plus therapy condition saw a significant reduction in their PTSD symptoms.Potential negative side effects of the drug such as nausea were minimal, and there was no evidence that participants were forming addictions to the drug. Studies on the addictiveness of MDMA have had mixed results, so the apparent lack of addiction in the current study is a cause for optimism.The first treatment option for people with PTSD is usually selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants such as Prozac, which are usually taken on a daily basis, aren t always effective, and can come with a whole host of unpleasant side effects.  The effect size for MDMA-assisted therapy is better than that for the SSRIs that have been investigated, suggesting that MDMA is a far better therapeutic for PTSD,  Mitchell says.Researchers are currently sourcing participants for a second phase 3 trial, and if similar results are found, they believe MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD could be approved by the FDA for clinical use by 2023. A study was also recently completed that investigated whether MDMA-assisted therapy could be effective in groups of people who have proved resistant to traditional PTSD treatment, such as SSRIs or therapy alone.  It definitely appears to be equally effective in people who are usually considered treatment resistant, so we re very excited to think that MDMA-assisted therapy is going to be an effective therapeutic in that hard-to-reach population,  Mitchell says.While the short-term results are certainly promising, the researchers are now turning their focus to long-term data from the phase 3 trial.  People in the phase 2 trial were better for years,  Mitchell says.  They seemed to have a new perspective on life and engaged more. As their social skill set built up, they were happier over time.  However, the long-term results from this latest phase 3 trial are less certain, since participants had more severe PTSD symptoms.Mitchell is quick to point out that people with PTSD should not try to self-medicate with MDMA. If MDMA is decriminalized, that doesn t mean it s safe,  she says.   It can be a very powerful tool, but it needs to have the right dose in the right context with the right support system. While the preliminary results are certainly encouraging, the drug itself cannot be considered a silver bullet in the treatment of PTSD and other disorders. Instead, it becomes a powerful tool for treatment once paired with therapy, as the drug elicits states of mind that make people more receptive to the benefits that therapy can offer.The results were presented at the American Chemical Society s Spring Meeting for 2022.</text>

		<title>Scientists Translated a Spiderweb Into Music, And It s Utterly Captivating</title>

		<text>Spiders rely quite significantly on touch to sense the world around them. Their bodies and legs are covered in tiny hairs and slits that can distinguish between different kinds of vibrations.Prey blundering into a web makes a very different vibrational clamor from another spider coming a-wooing, or the stirring of a breeze, for example. Each strand of a web produces a different tone.A few years ago, scientists translated the three-dimensional structure of a spider s web into music, working with artist Tomás Saraceno to create an interactive musical instrument, titled Spider s Canvas.The team later refined and built on that previous work, adding an interactive virtual reality component to allow people to enter and interact with the web.This research, the team says, will not only help them better understand the three-dimensional architecture of a spider s web, but may even help us learn the vibrational language of spiders. The spider lives in an environment of vibrating strings,  engineer Markus Buehler of MIT explained in 2021.  They don t see very well, so they sense their world through vibrations, which have different frequencies. When you think of a spider s web, you most likely think of the web of an orb weaver: flat, round, with radial spokes around which the spider constructs a spiral net. Most spiderwebs, however, are not of this kind, but built in three dimensions, like sheet webs, tangle webs, and funnel webs, for example.To explore the structure of these kinds of webs, the team housed a tropical tent-web spider (Cyrtophora citricola) in a rectangular enclosure, and waited for it to fill the space with a three-dimensional web. Then they used a sheet laser to illuminate and create high-definition images of 2D cross-sections of the web.A specially developed algorithm then pieced together the 3D architecture of the web from these 2D cross sections. To turn this into music, different sound frequencies were allocated to different strands. The notes thus generated were played in patterns based on the web s structure.They also scanned a web while it was being spun, translating each step of the process into music. This means that the notes change as the structure of the web changes, and the listener can hear the process of the web s construction.Having a record of the step-by-step process means we can also better understand how spiders build a 3D web without support structures – a skill that could be used for 3D printing, for example.Spider s Canvas allowed audiences to hear the spider music, but the virtual reality, in which users can enter and play strands of the web themselves, adds a whole new layer of experience, the researchers said. The virtual reality environment is really intriguing because your ears are going to pick up structural features that you might see but not immediately recognize,  Buehler explained. By hearing it and seeing it at the same time, you can really start to understand the environment the spider lives in. This VR environment, with realistic web physics, allows researchers to understand what happens when they mess with parts of the web, too. Stretch a strand, and its tone changes. Break one, and see how that affects the other strands around it.This, too, can help us understand the architecture of a spider s web, and why they are built the way they are.Perhaps most fascinatingly, the work enabled the team to develop an algorithm to identify the types of vibrations of a spider s web, translating them into  trapped prey , or  web under construction , or  another spider has arrived with amorous intent .This, the team said, is groundwork for the development of learning to speak spider – at least, tropical tent-web spider. Now we re trying to generate synthetic signals to basically speak the language of the spider,  Buehler said. If we expose them to certain patterns of rhythms or vibrations, can we affect what they do, and can we begin to communicate with them? Those are really exciting ideas. The team s previous research was published in 2018 in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.An earlier version of this article was published in April 2021.</text>

		<title>It s Official: NASA Confirms We ve Found 5,000 Worlds Outside The Solar System</title>
		<description> img alt= Artist s impression of Poltergeist, Phobetor, and Draugr.   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/lich-and-its-exoplanets_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p A galaxy of worlds! /p </description>
		<text>In January 1992, two cosmic objects forever changed our galaxy.For the first time, we had concrete evidence of extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, orbiting an alien star: two rocky worlds, whirling around a star 2,300 light-years away.Now, just over 30 years later, that number has exploded. This week, March 21 marked the hugely significant milestone of over 5,000 exoplanets confirmed. To be precise, 5,005 exoplanets are now documented in the NASA exoplanet archive, every one with its own unique characteristics.Each and every one of these exoplanets has appeared in peer-reviewed research, and been observed using multiple detection techniques or methods of analysis.The pickings are rich for follow-up study to learn more about these worlds with new instruments, such as the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope, and upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. It s not just a number,  says astronomer Jessie Christiansen of the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech.  Each one of them is a new world, a brand-new planet. I get excited about every one because we don t know anything about them. The first two worlds ever confirmed, discovered by astronomers Alexander Wolszczan and Dale Frail, were exoplanets 4.3 and 3.9 times the mass of Earth, whirling around a dead star known as a millisecond pulsar, which sends out  beats  or pulses of radio waves on millisecond timescales.A third exoplanet, much smaller at 0.02 times the mass of Earth, was discovered orbiting the star, since named Lich, in 1994. The exoplanets were named Poltergeist, Phobetor, and Draugr, respectively.The discovery suggested that the galaxy had to be teeming with the things. Pulsars are a type of neutron star: the dead cores of massive stars that have ejected most of their mass, then collapsed under their own gravity. Their formation process is pretty extreme, often involving colossal explosions. If you can find planets around a neutron star, planets have to be basically everywhere,  Wolszczan says.  The planet production process has to be very robust. But there was a catch. The technique used to identify these exoplanets was based on the very regular timing of pulses from the star, which are altered very slightly by the gravitational influence of the orbiting bodies.Alas, this technique is restricted to pulsars; it s unsuitable for main-sequence stars that don t have regular millisecond pulsations.However, when astronomer William Borucki of NASA pioneered the transit method, which observes faint, regular dips in starlight as an exoplanet passes between us and the host star, exoplanet science exploded.The Kepler Space Telescope, launched in 2009, contributed over 3,000 confirmed exoplanets to the list, with another 3,000 candidates waiting in the wings.In addition to the transit method, astronomers can study the gravitational effect exoplanets exert on their host stars. As the objects orbit a mutual center of gravity, a star appears to  wobble  slightly on the spot, altering the wavelengths of its light.In addition, if you know the mass of the star, you can study how much it wobbles to infer the mass of the exoplanet; and, if you know how intrinsically bright a star is, you can infer the size of the exoplanet.This is how we know that there are exoplanets out there in the Universe very, very different from those we have in our own home system.Hot Jupiters are enormous gas giants on incredibly close orbits around their stars, the proximity resulting in exoplanet temperatures that can be even hotter than some stars.Mini Neptunes inhabit the size and mass regime between Earth and Neptune, and could potentially be habitable. There are also super Earths, which are rocky like Earth, but up to a few times the mass.Because studying exoplanets directly is very hard – they are small, very dim, very far away, and often very close to a bright star whose light drowns out anything the exoplanet might reflect – there s still a lot we don t know. There are also still a lot of worlds out there beyond our current detection thresholds.But in the years ahead, those thresholds will retreat against the advance of technology and new analysis techniques, and we may find a variety of worlds beyond our wackiest dreams. Maybe we ll even find traces of life outside the Solar System. I get a real feeling of satisfaction, and really of awe at what s out there,  Borucki says. None of us expected this enormous variety of planetary systems and stars. It s just amazing. </text>

		<title>Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Aftermath Was Even More Brutal Than We Realized</title>
		<description> img alt= A T. rex chick shivers in the cold   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/DinosaurSulfurWinterSnow_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p The long winter. /p </description>
		<text>When the dinosaur-destroying asteroid collided with Earth 66 million years ago, massive amounts of sulfur – volumes more than were previously thought – were thrown high above land into the stratosphere, a new study finds.Once airborne, this vast cloud of sulfur-bearing gases blocked the Sun and cooled Earth for decades to centuries, then fell down as lethal acid rain on Earth, changing the chemistry of the oceans for tens of thousands of years, which is longer than previously thought, the study found.The findings show that  we ve underestimated the amount of this sulfur that this asteroid impact created,  study co-researcher James Witts, a lecturer in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol in the UK, told Live Science.As a result,  the climate change that was associated with it was much greater perhaps than we thought previously .The fact that sulfur continued pouring down on Earth s surface for so long may help explain why it took so long for life, especially marine life, to recover, as some of the sulfur that fell onto the land would have then washed away into the oceans, Witts said.Related: What happened when the dinosaur-killing asteroid slammed into Earth?The researchers  finding was completely serendipitous.  It was not something that was planned at all,  Witts said.The team had originally planned to study the geochemistry of ancient shells near the Brazos River in Falls County, Texas – a unique place that was underwater during the end-Cretaceous extinction, when the non-avian dinosaurs died out.It s also not too far from the Chicxulub crater in Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula, where the 6-mile-wide (10 kilometers) asteroid struck.The researchers took a few sediment samples at the site, which they hadn t planned on doing.These samples were brought to the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where study co-researcher Aubrey Zerkle, a geochemist and geobiologist, analyzed the different sulfur isotopes, or variations of sulfur that have a different number of neutrons in their nuclei.The researchers found  a very unusual signal  – the sulfur isotopes had unexpected tiny changes to their masses, Witts said. Such mass changes occur when sulfur enters the atmosphere and interacts with ultraviolet (UV) light. That can really only happen in two scenarios: either in an atmosphere that doesn t have any oxygen in it or when you have so much sulfur, it s gone really high up into an oxygenated atmosphere,  Witts said.Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and it has been enveloped by an oxygenated atmosphere since about 2.3 billion years ago. We re the first people to see this sort of thing in much more recent times,  at least in sediments that aren t on the Earth s poles, Witts said.(That s because volcanic eruptions release sulfur high into the atmosphere, which can mix with snow and end up in high concentrations in ice cores at the poles, where there is no other sulfur or sulfate to dilute the signal, Witts said.) You don t see [this signal] in marine rocks,  he said.  The sea has its own isotopic signature which totally dilutes the tiny amount of sulfur from these volcanoes. The fact that this signal is present in marine rock from the Cretaceous shows that,  there must have been a heck of a lot of sulfur in the atmosphere after this impact event,  Witts said. And that, of course, has a huge implication for climate change related to the impact because sulfur aerosols, we know from modern volcanic eruptions, cause cooling. A lot of the sulfur came from the sulfur-rich limestone at the Yucatan Peninsula. If the asteroid had hit somewhere else, perhaps there wouldn t have been as much sulfur released into the atmosphere and the climate change that followed might not have been as severe,  Witts said.  And therefore the extinction event might not have been so bad. Previous estimates of the sulfur aerosols entering Earth s atmosphere after the asteroid impact range from about 30 to 500 gigatons; according to climate models, this sulfur would have turned into sulfate aerosols, which would have caused 3.6 to 14.4 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 8 degrees Celsius) cooling of the Earth s surface for a few decades after the impact.But the new finding suggests that because the sulfur amount was higher, the climate change could have been even more severe.The study was published online Monday (March 21) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Related content:The 5 mass extinction events that shaped the history of Earth10 extraordinary dinosaur discoveries from 2021Photos: Dinosaur tracks reveal Australia s  Jurassic Park This article was originally published by Live Science.

		<title>Looking at a Human Face Triggers Activity in Our Brains Unlike Any Other Object</title>
		<description> img alt=   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/FaceBehindHands_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p We are social beings indeed. /p </description>
		<text>It may not feel like it, but our eyes are constantly making rapid, tiny movements called saccades, taking in new information as we focus our gaze on various things in the world. As we do so, our brains receive the input – and depending on what the object of our gaze is, it turns out the brain activity triggered can be quite unique. While we typically do not perceive our own eye movements, the abrupt change in visual input with each saccade has substantial consequences at the neuronal level,  researchers explain in a new study led by first author and cognitive neuroscientist Tobias Staudigl from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany.In an experiment, Staudigl and fellow researchers worked with 13 epilepsy patients, who had electrodes implanted in their brains to monitor their condition. This kind of intervention can be helpful for brain scientists, so they often turn to such patients with electrodes already implanted, in case they d be willing to volunteer their time.Thus, the patients consented to take part in a study in which they were instructed to freely view a range of visual stimuli displayed on a screen, including images of human faces, monkey faces, and also non-face imagery (pictures of flowers, fruit, cars, and so on).While they were doing this, a camera-based eye-tracking system monitored what objects their eyes were looking at, and the electrodes simultaneously monitored neural activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus – distinct parts of the brain that are both involved with different aspects of processing memories, amongst other functions, with the amygdala also important for regulating our emotions.(Pikovit44/Getty Images)When the participants looked at human faces, neurons fired and synchronized between the amygdala and the hippocampus in a specific pattern that was different to the results from the other stimuli – which the team interprets as evidence of how the brain handles memory encoding for important social information, distinct from other non-social objects. You could easily argue that faces are one of the most important objects we look at,  says senior author of the study, Ueli Rutishauser, the director of the neuroscience research at nonprofit healthcare and research organization Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. We make a lot of highly significant decisions based on looking at faces, including whether we trust somebody, whether the other person is happy or angry, or whether we have seen this person before. The foundations for those decisions have to start somewhere, and the researchers say the process can be seen beginning in the rapid adjustments of saccadic eye movements.It s long been known that seeing faces makes neurons fire in the amygdala more so than for other forms of stimuli, although the reasons for this have remained uncertain. One hypothesis is that these signals are transferred from the amygdala via strong projections to the hippocampus, where they elevate and prioritize hippocampal processing of stimuli with high social and emotional significance,  the researchers write. This may serve hippocampal memory encoding for salient stimuli and events. That could be what we re seeing here, with the researchers noting that the proportion of cells that were visually selective for human faces was substantially larger in the amygdala than in the hippocampus, suggesting that the amygdala plays a more important frontline role in identifying social stimuli in the first instance. We think that this is a reflection of the amygdala preparing the hippocampus to receive new socially relevant information that will be important to remember,  Rutishauser says.Another key finding was that long-distance communication between different parts of the brain was increased when social stimuli were present. When a fixation on a human face followed a saccade, neural communication between the amygdala and hippocampus was enhanced,  the researchers write.  The same effect was not observed for saccades and fixations that landed on other stimuli. However, when the participants looked at human faces they had already seen earlier in the experiment, the neuron-firing pattern in the amygdala appeared more slowly – suggesting learned and familiar faces don t spark the same level of neural excitement as new social stimuli.The findings are reported in Science Advances.</text>

		<title>Enormous Ice Wall Blocked Ancient Entry Into The Americas, Study Suggests</title>
		<description> img alt=   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/IcyCliffsProtudingFromAGlacier_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p Taller than any building on Earth. /p </description>
		<text>An icy barrier up to 300 stories high – taller than any building on Earth – may have prevented the first people from entering the New World over the land bridge that once connected Asia with the Americas, a new study has found.These findings suggest that the first people in the Americas instead arrived via boats along the Pacific coast, researchers said.There are two main hypotheses as to how people first migrated to North America. The older idea suggested that people made this journey when Beringia – the landmass that once connected Asia with North America, now divided by the Bering Strait – was relatively free of ice.The more recent notion suggested that travelers made their way on watercraft along the Pacific coasts of Asia, Beringia, and North America. A major factor influencing the way in which the first Americans arrived were giant ice sheets that once blanketed North America. Previous research suggested that an ice-free corridor between the margins of these ice sheets may have enabled travel from Beringia down to the Great Plains.Based on stone tools dating back as much as 13,400 years, archaeologists had long suggested that people from the prehistoric culture known as the Clovis were the first to migrate from Asia to the Americas. Prior work regarding the age of the ice-free corridor suggested it might have served as the migration route for Clovis people.However, scientists have recently unearthed a great deal of evidence of a pre-Clovis presence in North America. For example, in 2021, 60 ancient footprints in New Mexico suggested humans were there about 23,000 years ago, and in 2020, archaeologists discovered stone artifacts in central Mexico that were at least 26,500 years old.Related: In photos: The Clovis culture   stone tools Recent estimates suggested the ice-free corridor did not open until about 14,000 to 15,000 years ago, which would mean that the earliest Americans may have relied on a coastal route instead of an overland one. Still, a great deal of uncertainty remained when it came to the age of the ice-free corridor. To help solve this mystery, researchers sought to pinpoint when the ice-free corridor opened. They investigated 64 geological samples taken from six locations spanning 745 miles (1,200 kilometers) along the zone where the ice-free corridor was thought to have existed.The scientists examined boulders that glaciers once carried far from their original homes, much as rivers might wash pebbles down riverbeds over time.They analyzed how long these rocks were exposed on Earth s surface – and thus how long they sat on ice-free ground – by looking at levels of radioactive elements that generated when the rocks were bombarded by high-energy rays from space.The new findings suggest that the ice-free corridor did not fully open until about 13,800 years ago, and the ice sheets  may have been 1,500 to 3,000 feet (455 to 910 m) high in the area where they covered the ice-free corridor,  study lead author Jorie Clark, a geologist and archaeologist at Oregon State University, told Live Science.By comparison, the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, stands about 2,722 feet (829.8 m) high. This is a very nicely executed study which tackles a long-standing question,  Matthew Bennett, a researcher who studies trace fossils at Bournemouth University in England and who did not take part in this work, told Live Science. The results are interesting and help add to our understanding of this potential migration route. The authors are to be commended on a great bit of science. All in all,  we now have robust evidence that the ice-free corridor was not open and available for the first peopling of the Americas,  Clark said. Still,  there is still a lot to learn about whether they actually did come down the coastal route, and if so, how did they travel. We need to find archaeological sites from the area. After the first wave of migration and once the ice-free corridor opened, other migration waves may have taken that more direct route, Clark noted.  But again, we need to find archaeological sites in the ice-free corridor to evaluate when they came down. John Hoffecker, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who did not participate in this study, pointed out that the earliest signs of people in the Americas may reveal that humans were present there when both coastal and interior routes to North America were blocked by ice.If true,  the simplest explanation is that they followed an interior route through the wide ice-free corridor that was present before 30,000 years ago,  he told Live Science.The scientists detailed their findings online March 21 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Related content:The 25 most mysterious archaeological finds on EarthIn photos: New Clovis site in SonoraIn Photos: Human Skeleton Sheds Light on First AmericansThis article was originally published by Live Science.

		<title>Weird Circular Objects Observed in Space May Finally Be Explained</title>
		<description> img alt= Artist’s impression of odd radio circles.   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/MassiveGreenConjoinedBubblesLikeBlobInSpace_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p Unlike anything seen before. /p </description>
		<text>In 2019, my colleagues and I discovered spooky glowing rings in the sky using CSIRO s ASKAP radio telescope in Western Australia. The rings were unlike anything seen before, and we had no idea what they were.We dubbed them odd radio circles, or ORCs. They continue to puzzle us, but new data from South Africa s MeerKAT telescope are helping us solve the mystery.We can now see each ORC is centered on a galaxy too faint to be detected earlier. The circles are most likely enormous explosions of hot gas, about a million light years across, emanating from the central galaxy.Our paper showing these results has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication by Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.We now have beautiful images of one of these rings taken with South Africa s MeerKAT radio telescope, which shows the ORC in stunning detail.(Jayanne English/MeerKAT/Dark Energy Survey.)Above: MeerKAT (green/grey) image of the odd radio circle ORC1 superimposed on an optical image from the Dark Energy Survey.For example, MeerKAT sees a small blob of radio emission in the centre of the ring, which is coincident with a distant galaxy. We are now fairly certain this galaxy generated the ORC.We see these central galaxies in other ORCs too, all at vast distances from Earth. We now think that these rings surround distant galaxies about a billion light-years away, which means the rings are enormous – around a million light-years across.From modeling the faint cloudy radio emission that MeerKAT detects within the rings, it seems the rings are the edges of a spherical shell surrounding the galaxy, like a blast wave from a giant explosion in the galaxy.They look like rings instead of orbs only because the sphere appears brighter at the edges where there is more material along the line of sight, much like a soap bubble.Above: Artist s impression of odd radio circles exploding from a central galaxy. It is thought to take the rings 1 billion years to reach the size we see them today. The rings are so big (millions of light-years across), they ve expanded past other galaxies. (Sam Moorfield/CSIRO)MeerKAT has also mapped the polarization of the radio waves, which tells us about the magnetic field in the ring. Our polarization image shows a magnetic field running along the edge of the sphere.This suggests that an explosion in the central galaxy caused a hot blast to collide with the tenuous gas outside the galaxy. The resulting shock wave then energized electrons in the gas, making them spiral around the magnetic field, generating radio waves.(Larry Rudnick/MeerKAT data)ABOVE: Lines around the edge of the ORC show the direction of the magnetic field. A circular magnetic field like this indicates it has been compressed by a shock wave from the central galaxy.One big surprise from the MeerKAT result is that within the ring we see several curved filaments of radio emission. We still don t know what these are.But we do know that the sphere is so huge that it has swallowed up other galaxies as it blasted out from the central galaxy. Perhaps the filaments are trails of gas ripped off the galaxies by the passing shock wave?The big question, of course, is what caused the explosion. We are exploring two possibilities.One is that they were caused by the merging of two supermassive black holes. Such a  merger event  releases an enormous amount of energy, enough to generate the ORC.Another possibility is that the central galaxy went through a  starburst  event, in which millions of stars were suddenly born from the gas in the galaxy. Such a starburst causes hot gas to blast out from the galaxy, causing a spherical shock wave.Both black hole mergers and starburst events are rare, which accounts for why ORCs are so rare (only five have so far been reported).The puzzle of ORCs is not solved yet, and we still have much to learn about these mysterious rings in the sky. So far, we have only detected them with radio telescopes – we see nothing from the rings at optical, infrared, or X-ray wavelengths.To find out more, we need a tool even more sensitive than MeerKAT and ASKAP. Fortunately, the global astronomical community is building just such an observatory – the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), an international effort with telescopes in South Africa and Australia.ASKAP and MeerKAT were built to test the sites and technology for the SKA. Quite apart from their role as precursors for the SKA, both telescopes have been hugely successful in their own right, making major discoveries in their first years of operation.Their success in discovering and studying ORCs therefore bodes well for the SKA.The two telescopes are also beautifully complementary – ASKAP is superb at surveying large areas of sky and finding new objects, while MeerKAT is unrivaled for zooming in on those objects and studying them with higher sensitivity and resolution.The SKA promises to surpass both. No doubt the SKA will find many more ORCs, and will also be able to probe them to find out what they are telling us about the life cycle of galaxies.Ray Norris, Professor, School of Science, Western Sydney University.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

		<title>Can t Stand Some Sounds? It Could Be Due to an  Abnormal  Brain Connection</title>
		<description> img alt=   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2021-05/processed/close_up_man_chewing_fruit_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p Eeeeeeeeeeek. /p </description>
		<text>If you have an overreaction to  triggering  sounds such as other people chewing or drumming their fingers, you probably have misophonia. Last year, scientists finally discovered a key brain connection responsible for setting it off.The connection runs from the auditory cortex (the brain s hearing center) to the orofacial motor cortex (controlling movement of the face, mouth and throat). This makes sense, as most misophonia-triggering sounds are caused by actions involving the human face – such as chewing or breathing.As a result of the findings, the researchers have a suggestion: People with misophonia are actually experiencing a stimulation of the same part of the motor cortex that is causing the triggering sound from someone else. Our findings indicate that for people with misophonia there is abnormal communication between the auditory and motor brain regions,  said neuroscientist Sukhbinder Kumar, from Newcastle University in the UK. You could describe it as a  super-sensitized connection . This is the first time such a connection in the brain has been identified for the condition. The team analyzed fMRI brain scans from a total of 75 people with and without misophonia to discover this super-sensitized connection. Data was collected with no noise, with misophonia trigger sounds (like chewing), with sounds designed to be unpleasant to everyone (like screaming), and with neutral sounds (like rainfall).The researchers made an additional discovery too: a stronger connection between the motor cortex and the visual cortex. This gives us more clues about what might be setting off misophonia in the brain. What surprised us was that we also found a similar pattern of communication between the visual and motor regions, which reflects that misophonia can also occur when triggered by something visual,  said Kumar. This leads us to believe that this communication activates something called the  mirror system , which helps us process movements made by other individuals by activating our own brain in a similar way – as if we were making that movement ourselves. This mirror neuron system, which has been previously studied, is thought to work in the same way inside the brain whether we re actually doing something or watching someone else do it. The researchers suggested that misophonia is so uncomfortable because it feels like an intrusion into the brain when this mirroring happens.That idea is backed up by one of the ways misophonia can be managed in some people: by mimicking the action creating the trigger sound and thus taking back control. If we can better understand how that works, we could improve our approaches to managing misophonia, which can have a seriously negative impact on people s day-to-day lives.Between 6 to 20 percent of the population are thought to be living with some form of misophonia, but there s still plenty about it that we don t understand. In its most severe form, it can make some work, family and social situations almost intolerable. The study provides new ways to think about the treatment options for misophonia,  neurologist Tim Griffiths, from Newcastle University, said last year. Instead of focussing on sound centers in the brain, which many existing therapies do, effective therapies should consider motor areas of the brain as well. The research was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.A version of this article was originally published in May 2021.</text>

		<title>Physicists Just Discovered a Weird New Tetragonal Phase of Water Ice</title>
		<description> img alt= The diamond anvil used to squash the sample.   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/diamond-anvil-for-pressurising-water-ice_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p Literally cool! /p </description>
		<text>A new crystalline form of water ice has been discovered in fleeting transitions between phases at high pressures.It s called Ice-VIIt, and it takes place as the substance slides between two already known, cubic arrangements of molecules. Although it s unlikely Ice-VIIt would naturally appear on Earth s surface, it could reveal more about how water behaves on massive alien worlds.We might think it commonplace, but water is actually pretty weird compared to other liquids we know. The arrangement of molecules within water s frozen form – ice – can vary significantly, depending on the conditions around it.We know of at least 19 of these solid phases of ice, some of which occur naturally, some of which have only been seen in laboratory conditions.The ice you see in the freezer, or falling from the sky as snowflakes or hailstones, is the most common natural ice on Earth. It is called Ice-I, with oxygen atoms arranged in a hexagonal grid. The structure is, however, geometrically frustrated, with the hydrogen atoms hanging about in a disorderly fashion.When physicists cool Ice-I at various temperatures and apply different pressures to it, the hydrogen and oxygen atoms within can periodically reach different arrangements, sometimes even ordering themselves more neatly. These various forms of water ice are not always stable, but we can explore these in the lab to reveal their curious molecular structures.Two of these phases that have cubic structures are Ice-VII, which has disordered hydrogen, and Ice-X, which is symmetric. These can be reached by subjecting ice to high pressures tens to hundreds of thousands greater than Earth s atmospheric pressure at sea level, Ice-VII at even lower pressures than Ice-X.To study the transitions between ice phases, a team of physicists led by Zach Grande of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas performed experiments on high pressure ice using a new technique to measure the properties of the ice as pressure was applied. The researchers squeezed a sample of water in a diamond anvil, forcing it to freeze in a jumble of crystals. Lasers were used to then heat the sample, causing it to melt before re-freezing into what the researchers described as a powder-like collection of crystals.By incrementally raising the pressure in the anvil, with periodic blasts from the laser, the researchers created Ice-VII, and observed the transition to Ice-X. In between, thanks to their new measurement technique, they also observed the new intermediate phase, Ice-VIIt.In this phase, the cubic lattice of Ice-VII is stretched along one of its vectors so that the structure extends into a rectangular arrangement, with a cubic footprint, before settling into the symmetric, fully ordered cubic arrangement of Ice-X. This arrangement is known as tetragonal.The team also showed that Ice-X can form at much lower pressures than previously thought. Ice-VII forms from approximately 3 gigapascals; that is, 30,000 atmospheric pressures. According to the team s observations, the transition to Ice-VIIt occurs at around 5.1 gigapascals.Previous reports have put the transition pressure for Ice-X between 40 and 120 gigapascals. However, Grande and his team observed the transition between Ice-VIIt and Ice-X occurring at around 30.9 gigapascals.This, the team said, should help resolve the debate about the Ice-X transition pressure. Zach s work has demonstrated that this transformation to an ionic state occurs at much, much lower pressures than ever thought before,  said physicist Ashkan Salamat of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. It s the missing piece, and the most precise measurements ever on water at these conditions. This, the team said, could have important implications for studying the interior conditions of other worlds. Water-rich planets outside the Solar System could, they said, have Ice-VIIt in abundance, even increasing the chance of conditions suitable for the emergence of life.The team s research has been published in Physical Review B.</text>

		<title>Here s How a Large-Enough Solar Storm Could Completely Change The World</title>
		<description> img alt= Not our actual distance to the Sun.   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/DistantSunLashingCloserEarthWithPlasma_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p They ve happened before. /p </description>
		<text>On Sept. 1 and 2, 1859, telegraph systems around the world failed catastrophically. The operators of the telegraphs reported receiving electrical shocks, telegraph paper catching fire, and being able to operate equipment with batteries disconnected.During the evenings, the aurora borealis, more commonly known as the northern lights, could be seen as far south as Colombia. Typically, these lights are only visible at higher latitudes, in northern Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia.What the world experienced that day, now known as the Carrington Event, was a massive geomagnetic storm. These storms occur when a large bubble of superheated gas called plasma is ejected from the surface of the sun and hits the Earth. This bubble is known as a coronal mass ejection.The plasma of a coronal mass ejection consists of a cloud of protons and electrons, which are electrically charged particles. When these particles reach the Earth, they interact with the magnetic field that surrounds the planet.This interaction causes the magnetic field to distort and weaken, which in turn leads to the strange behavior of the aurora borealis and other natural phenomena. As an electrical engineer who specializes in the power grid, I study how geomagnetic storms also threaten to cause power and internet outages and how to protect against that.The Carrington Event of 1859 is the largest recorded account of a geomagnetic storm, but it is not an isolated event.Geomagnetic storms have been recorded since the early 19th century, and scientific data from Antarctic ice core samples has shown evidence of an even more massive geomagnetic storm that occurred around 774 CE, now known as the Miyake Event. That solar flare produced the largest and fastest rise in carbon-14 ever recorded. Geomagnetic storms trigger high amounts of cosmic rays in Earth s upper atmosphere, which in turn produce carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon.A geomagnetic storm 60 percent smaller than the Miyake Event occurred around 993 CE. Ice core samples have shown evidence that large-scale geomagnetic storms with similar intensities as the Miyake and Carrington events occur at an average rate of once every 500 years.Nowadays the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration uses the Geomagnetic Storms scale to measure the strength of these solar eruptions. The  G scale  has a rating from 1 to 5 with G1 being minor and G5 being extreme. The Carrington Event would have been rated G5.It gets even scarier when you compare the Carrington Event with the Miyake Event. Scientist were able to estimate the strength of the Carrington Event based on the fluctuations of Earth s magnetic field as recorded by observatories at the time. There was no way to measure the magnetic fluctuation of the Miyake event. Instead, scientists measured the increase in carbon-14 in tree rings from that time period.The Miyake Event produced a 12 percent increase in carbon-14. By comparison, the Carrington Event produced less than 1 percent increase in Carbon-14, so the Miyake Event likely dwarfed the G5 Carrington Event.Today, a geomagnetic storm of the same intensity as the Carrington Event would affect far more than telegraph wires and could be catastrophic. With the ever-growing dependency on electricity and emerging technology, any disruption could lead to trillions of dollars of monetary loss and risk to life dependent on the systems. The storm would affect a majority of the electrical systems that people use every day.Geomagnetic storms generate induced currents, which flow through the electrical grid. The geomagnetically induced currents, which can be in excess of 100 amperes, flow into the electrical components connected to the grid, such as transformers, relays and sensors.One hundred amperes is equivalent to the electrical service provided to many households. Currents this size can cause internal damage in the components, leading to large scale power outages.A geomagnetic storm three times smaller than the Carrington Event occurred in Quebec, Canada, in March 1989. The storm caused the Hydro-Quebec electrical grid to collapse.During the storm, the high magnetically induced currents damaged a transformer in New Jersey and tripped the grid s circuit breakers. In this case, the outage led to five million people being without power for nine hours.In addition to electrical failures, communications would be disrupted on a worldwide scale. Internet service providers could go down, which in turn would take out the ability of different systems to communicate with each other. High-frequency communication systems such as ground-to-air, shortwave and ship-to-shore radio would be disrupted.Satellites in orbit around the Earth could be damaged by induced currents from the geomagnetic storm burning out their circuit boards. This would lead to disruptions in satellite-based telephone, internet, radio and television.Also, as geomagnetic storms hit the Earth, the increase in solar activity causes the atmosphere to expand outward. This expansion changes the density of the atmosphere where satellites are orbiting. Higher density atmosphere creates drag on a satellite, which slows it down. And if it isn t maneuvered to a higher orbit, it can fall back to Earth.One other area of disruption that would potentially affect everyday life is navigation systems. Virtually every mode of transportation, from cars to airplanes, use GPS for navigation and tracking. Even handheld devices such as cell phones, smart watches and tracking tags rely on GPS signals sent from satellites.Military systems are heavily dependent on GPS for coordination. Other military detection systems such as over-the-horizon radar and submarine detection systems could be disrupted, which would hamper national defense.In terms of the internet, a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the Carrington Event could produce geomagnetically induced currents in the submarine and terrestrial cables that form the backbone of the internet as well as the data centers that store and process everything from email and text messages to scientific data sets and artificial intelligence tools. This would potentially disrupt the entire network and prevent the servers from connecting to each other.It is only a matter of time before the Earth is hit by another geomagnetic storm. A Carrington Event-size storm would be extremely damaging to the electrical and communication systems worldwide with outages lasting into the weeks.If the storm is the size of the Miyake Event, the results would be catastrophic for the world with potential outages lasting months if not longer. Even with space weather warnings from NOAA s Space Weather Prediction Center, the world would have only a few minutes to a few hours notice.I believe it is critical to continue researching ways to protect electrical systems against the effects of geomagnetic storms, for example by installing devices that can shield vulnerable equipment like transformers and by developing strategies for adjusting grid loads when solar storms are about to hit. In short, it s important to work now to minimize the disruptions from the next Carrington Event.

		<title>Scientists Surveyed What Makes You a Boring Person, And The Results Are Harsh</title>
		<description> img alt=   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/WomanSittingVeryBoredTalkingWithAMan_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p Can you guess the most boring hobbies? /p </description>
		<text>Although many of us are likely trying our best to be interesting, boring people are seemingly everywhere. Maybe it s the person who never finishes a story properly, or someone who just can t stop filling you in on their bird-watching  adventures .A new paper has investigated what makes people appear boring, and how this impacts our perceptions in relation to boring people. To do this, researchers asked over 500 people in five different studies to rank the most stereotypically boring characteristics, hobbies, and jobs.  Unfortunately, some people are perceived as boring,  the team, led by University of Essex psychology researcher Wijnand Van Tilburg, writes in their paper. We examined the stereotypical features of boring others by having people generate and then rate these [..] These results suggest that being stereotyped as a bore may come with substantially negative interpersonal consequences. In the first two studies, which included a total of 463 people recruited via MTurk, the team asked participants to write down a list of boring features, and then rank them.The volunteers classified data analysis, accounting, tax/insurance, cleaning, and banking as the five most boring jobs, while the most boring hobbies were sleeping (huh?), religion, watching TV, observing animals, and doing math (poor mathematicians!).When asked about the characteristics of stereotypical bores, people nominated attributes like having no interests, no sense of humor, being unopinionated, or a bit of a complainer. The more typical the features of stereotypical boringness described a person, the more the person was perceived as boring,  the team writes. Furthermore, and important for the social consequences of such perception, stereotypical boringness affected perceptions of interpersonal warmth and competence. While it s all a bit fun to think up the most boring people imaginable, those that see themselves in the above traits might actually be getting the rough end of the stick in social situations.In the next two studies the team undertook, when people were presented with descriptions of imaginary people according to the  boring characteristics  found in the first study (including adjectives such as  uneducated  or  has a monotonous voice ), the bores were seen as lacking warmth and competence, and were socially avoided.Even worse, in the last study, when asked how much they d need to be financially compensated for spending time with a  stereotypical bore  described in a vignette, participants nominated significant sums of money compared to vignettes of less boring people. Perceptions can change, but people may not take time to speak to those with  boring  jobs and hobbies, instead choosing to avoid them,  said Van Tilburg. They don t get a chance to prove people wrong and break these negative stereotypes. This is a relatively small study, and the majority of participants lived in the United States, so it s likely that around the world different jobs, hobbies, and characteristics might be classed as boring.But this study is one of the first to investigate the  boring people  stereotype across multiple domains, and having this information is important to try and break those stereotypes down.For example, the team questions why boring people were also seen as incompetent by the study participants, despite these attributes being unrelated.  I would have thought that accountants would be seen as boring, but effective and the perfect person to do a good job on your tax return,  said Van Tilburg. The truth of the matter is people like bankers and accountants are highly capable and have power in society – perhaps we should try not to upset them and stereotype them as boring! The research has been published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. </text>

		<title>People in One of World s Oldest Cities Colored The Bones of Their Dead</title>

		<text>The sprawling ruins of Çatalhöyük – a vast, ancient human settlement in what we now know as Turkey – are much like a precursor to the modern metropolis of today. Yet, over the course of 9,000 years, times have certainly changed.Çatalhöyük, often described as one of the world s oldest cities, was one of the largest Neolithic settlements in Anatolia, providing a home for up to 8,000 people at its peak, after its founding in approximately 7100 BCE.But while this sprawling city of the past shares many similarities with modern urban centers, striking contrasts are also apparent.Hand print on wall. (Jason Quinlan/Çatalhöyük Research Project)One of the most obvious: Çatalhöyük had no streets. Dwellings were constructed directly alongside each other, so that the only way to enter buildings was to climb down into them from the rooftop.Once inside, even if nobody was around, you were not alone. The people of Çatalhöyük buried their dead inside their homes, underneath the floor. Adults were most often placed in a flexed position, located beneath the northern and eastern platforms of the central room,  a team of researchers, led by first author and archaeo-anthropologist Eline Schotsmans from the Université de Bordeaux in France, explains in a new study analyzing the funerary practices of ancient Çatalhöyük. Perinate, neonate, and infants were buried in more variable locations within the house. Burial placement wasn t the only custom unusual by our modern Western standards. Çatalhöyük s skeletons were sometimes ritualistically painted before burial, although much has remained unknown about the specifics of the pigments used – and the symbolism of their colorings.In the new study, Schotsmans and fellow researchers examined the skeletal remains of former Çatalhöyük individuals, over 800 of whom have been excavated since the early 1990s; the team also analyzed the pigments used on them (or on associated burial items) with an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer.Detail of cinnabar stripe on cranium of male individual. (Marco Milella)Ultimately, only a small minority of Çatalhöyük s dead (about 6 percent of the individuals studied here) were directly treated with pigments, while 11 percent featured pigment on grave items buried with the deceased, such as stained shells, bowls, baskets, and bone objects.Pigments applied to skeletal remains were always red in color (usually on the cranium), with red ochre being the most commonly used pigment. More males than females received direct treatment with pigment, and adults were also slightly more likely than children to be painted.Less common pigments seem to have reflected the social identity of the deceased, the researchers observe, with cinnabar (a red form of mercury sulfide) reserved largely for males, and either directly painted onto bone, or absorbed from red headbands the men wore while alive or when buried after death.Meanwhile, blue and green pigments on burial items were solely limited to females and children. These colors have sometimes been associated with concepts of growth, fertility, and ripeness, which are abstractions that could be related to the transition to agriculture,  the researchers write, although they note that the limited sample size of the colorants found so far limits our ability to interpret the discoveries.What is clear, however, is that there s some kind of link between the numbers of burials within a dwelling and layers of painting found on the walls above the grave. This means: when they buried someone, they also painted on the walls of the house , says senior researcher and anthropologist Marco Milella from the University of Bern in Switzerland.Geometric wall painting inside building. (Jason Quinlan/Çatalhöyük Research Project)Aside from the issue of pigment, not everybody in Çatalhöyük was buried in the same way, or perhaps buried at all. Among the human remains found in the ancient city, some have never been disturbed since Neolithic times, while others were interfered with by subsequent Neolithic activity, with evidence of disarticulated skeletons or isolated bones.This could potentially mean that skeletal elements were sometimes dug up in ancient Çatalhöyük, with the bones of deceased individuals serving some form of symbolic role in the community, before later being buried again. Other individuals, either as complete bodies or loose skeletal elements, remained in the community,  the researchers write. These circulating skeletal elements were eventually deposited in secondary or tertiary deposition contexts, which may also have been linked to the creation of architectural paintings in an indirect way. As for what purpose this served, it s impossible to know for sure, but the researchers say the continued use of excavated human remains within the community could have been a way of keeping the memory of those people alive, in a manner of speaking. According to socio-cultural anthropologists, collective memory is handed down from generation to generation through repetition of past actions and by direct object-to-memory association,  the researchers explain. Intramural burials may have been a part of processes of memory retention with each interment contributing to communal memory by keeping the deceased close to the daily rhythm of repeated household activities. The findings are published in Scientific Reports.</text>

		<text>A new image shows a breathtaking galaxy as you have never seen it before.Not only is the image absolutely spectacular, it s scientifically valuable: By studying the galaxy s light across multiple wavelengths, scientists can gain a better understanding of star formation and evolution processes.The galaxy in question is an object called NGC 4254, or Messier 99; the new capture reveals it across multiple spectra of light, thanks to the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on ESO s Very Large Telescope.All galaxies are special, but NGC 4254, located around 50 million light-years from the Milky Way, belongs to a subset deemed spectacular among spectacular, like an albino peacock: a  grand design  spiral galaxy.This is a spiral galaxy with prominent, well-formed and visible spiral arms; almost the platonic ideal of what a spiral galaxy should look like, unlike a flocculent spiral galaxy, with fluffy, patchy and broken arms.Hubble s visible light image of NCG 4254. (NASA/ESA/Hubble/Janice Lee/Leo Shatz)However, through the eye of MUSE, NGC 4254 becomes a lot fluffier, as it reveals the interstellar gas ionized by newborn stars. Although the galaxy isn t birthing stars at a rate high enough to categorize it as a starburst galaxy, its activity is three times higher than the average for galaxies of its type.Astronomers think this could be because of an interaction with another galaxy, millions of years ago. The clue to support this lies with one of NGC 4254 s spiral arms, which seems looser and more extended than the other.This ancient interaction would have perturbed NGC 4254, causing enough compression in its molecular gas to trigger heightened star formation activity.The new MUSE image of NGC 4354. (ESO/PHANGS)Whatever the cause, its relatively close proximity to the Milky Way, and the angle at which we can view it, combine to make NGC 4254 an excellent example for studying star formation processes.The MUSE image was taken as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) project, which takes high-resolution, multi-wavelength images of nearby galaxies in order to study the entire cycle of how stars are born.You can download wallpaper-sized versions of the new image from the ESO website.</text>

		<title>Is It Okay to Take Melatonin For Your Sleep? A Doctor Explains The Risks</title>
		<description> img alt=   src= https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/WomanHoldingRedSupplementGummiesInHand_1024.jpg  width= 100%  /  p It s not  just  a supplement. /p </description>
		<text>I have been a doctor for over 20 years, 12 of which were dedicated exclusively to the practice of sleep medicine. Over the years, I have seen an enormous increase in the use of melatonin by my patients and their families. Although melatonin has helped many of my patients, there are some concerns that I have that are worth sharing.First, I am not sure most of my patients that took melatonin before my clinical evaluation knew exactly what melatonin was. Melatonin is a hormone produced by a gland in the brain called the pineal gland. The main function of melatonin is sleep regulation.Melatonin levels increase in response to darkness, telling the brain that night has arrived and it is time to sleep. When there is bright light, as in the morning, melatonin production shuts down and the brain knows that it is daytime.The day-night regulation properties of melatonin and light make them the two key factors in the establishment of the internal sleep-wake clock, or what is called the  circadian cycle .A circadian disorder occurs when there is a mismatch between the internal clock and the socially accepted time to go to sleep or to wake up, as is seen when someone travels across time zones and has jet lag. But jet lag sometimes can occur in the absence of travel. For example, when you remain in an environment of bright lights until late hours of the night, you fool your brain into thinking that it is still daytime.In this case, melatonin production does not occur and you don t feel sleepy until the late hours of the night, or sometimes early hours in the morning.I have seen many teenagers come to my clinic because they can t sleep until 2 am or 3 am, but they re up watching videos on their electronic devices until late at night.I usually recommend my patients turn the lights off at a reasonable time and expect sleepiness to start occurring within one hour. But it takes time for the natural clock to adjust to a new schedule, and often my patients prefer to use a melatonin supplement to quicken the circadian time adjustment.With the increase in use of electronic devices, sleep disorders have become quite common and melatonin use has increased. Because of its sleep-promoting properties, melatonin is also an incredibly attractive option for people who suffer from insomnia or sleep disruption.In some countries, such as the US, melatonin can be bought without a prescription. This situation concerns me because a lack of regulation can mean an increased risk of taking a different dose or ingredients than those reported.In fact, a study of melatonin supplements found that the content of the hormone ranged from -83 percent to +478 percent of the labelled content. The researchers also found other substances that were not reported to be in the preparation, including serotonin and valerian.In the EU, the UK, Canada and Australia, melatonin is obtained only by prescription for the short-term treatment of insomnia. This approach allows for better regulation, understanding and explanation of risks, benefits and alternatives to the use of melatonin.Even though melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone, it does not come without side-effects, the most common being headaches and dizziness. It can also interact with other medicines, such as anticoagulants (drugs that help prevent blood clots).The best evidence of safety for the use of melatonin is for short-term use only (one to three months) and in low doses (0.5-1mg). The long-term effects of melatonin remain unknown.Have I used melatonin or recommended it to my patients? Absolutely. But only when I know exactly what I am recommending it for. Insomnia can be a symptom of a sleep disorder like restless legs syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea, or it can be a symptom of another condition, such as depression, asthma or pain.When a sleep specialist identifies the correct diagnosis, then the treatment options can be explored. When I need to prescribe melatonin, I usually recommend starting with the lowest dose possible (0.5 mg) one to two hours before their current bedtime, and I recommend that the patient turns their lights off, or dims them, before taking melatonin. I also recommend avoiding other contributors to poor sleep, such as caffeinated products after 3 pm, heavy exercise in the evening, or the use of electronic devices before bedtime. Lourdes M.
