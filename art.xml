It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians. In a Telegram message this weekend, Mariupol City Council said the building of G12 art school in Mariupol’s Left Bank district was destroyed in a Russian attack on Saturday, March 19. The number of casualties is still unknown. The building sheltered “women, children and the elderly,” the Telegram message said, adding that “peaceful people are still under the rubble.”  Last week, Russian troops bombed Mariupol’s Drama Theater where more than 1,000 civilians were taking shelter from the war. About 130 people were reportedly rescued from the building while hundreds remain trapped under the ruins. Satellite images taken before the bombing showed the word “children” visibly inscribed in Russian on the ground in the front and behind the theater in the hope that Russian fighter jets would avoid targeting the building. The humanitarian crisis in Mariupol continues to escalate, three weeks after Russian forces laid siege on the city. This weekend, the Mariupol City Council has also alleged that thousands of locals had been kidnapped and deported to Russian territory.    In a video address to his nation today, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the siege on Mariupol a “war crime.”“To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,” he said.Earlier in March, the United Nations Human Rights Council voted in favor of a commission to investigate alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Yevheniia Filipenko, Ukraine’s UN ambassador, told the council that there was “irrefutable evidence of gross and systematic human rights violations as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia.”     Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Previously by nomination only, the ARCAthens fully-funded residency is now open to all.Art.

This wasn’t because of the artwork itself, which she proclaimed “cool and ugly at the same time.” It was because answering my question about what she thought of the work caused her to loosen her grasp on the balloon she was bringing home from a kindergarten classmate’s birthday party. Hayden has fashioned a hundred school desks from cedar logs salvaged from the New Jersey Pine Barrens and installed them in four groups spread across the park’s lawns. Spiny branches emerge from their seats and desktops, splaying off in all directions. I wanted to ask my children what they thought about the work because Hayden has explained that Brier Patch comments on education. The title refers to folktales about a wily rabbit who begs the fox who has captured him not to throw him into a nearby patch of thorny brambles. (In America, the folktales were most famously reincarnated in the “Uncle Remus” stories about Br’er Rabbit.) The angry fox, wishing to torment his victim, hurls him into the thorns … only for the rabbit to escape, since he knows how to navigate the seemingly impenetrable pathways through the patch.As my daughter sobbed, my seven-year-old son delivered his opinion. He couldn’t tell whether the work was ugly or beautiful, happy or sad. He would only say that it made him feel confused. Frustrated, I gave up on our cultural outing and delivered on the milkshakes I had promised from the in-park Shake Shack. Back home, reading Hayden’s interview with the New York Times, I realized my son was not so obtuse after all. Hayden said that Brier Patch’s branches could symbolize the barriers to education often present in the United States. On the other hand, he claims that the work can also symbolize that same system’s benefits. No one could sit on these seats, but they might imagine themselves finding a creative perch on the branches, sheltering within the system. The work can be seen as a critique or a celebration — or both — depending on the visitor’s frame of reference.Confusing, indeed. Or perhaps a better word might be evasive — Hayden escapes being pinned down by an interpretation just as surely as Br’er Rabbit escaped Br’er Fox.The one thing Brier Patch is not is a brier patch. The work originated as an installation of six desks at White Columns in 2018. There, the desks were pushed close enough together that their branches intertwined, creating a thicket in the gallery. But the desks in the park sit in widely spaced aisles. The tips of their branches brush up against each other overhead, like enclosed bowers arching over walks in a genteel garden. Nothing would prevent you from moving easily between the desks.One of the four groups of desks is branch-free. In the middle of the dense text on the park’s signage about the piece, a sentence notes that Hayden “offers” these desks to “individuals and groups to interact with the piece for contemplation or convening.” I haven’t yet seen anyone take up this offer, perhaps because these desks are surrounded by a fence — a low one, to be sure, but still a barrier. The soft, bright cedar desktops, ripe for doodling or carving, or even staining with Shake Shack ketchup, remain unscathed, more than a month into the installation’s January to May run.The Madison Square Park Conservancy, the nonprofit that manages the park through a public-private partnership, takes similar care of the space’s other features. Its Shake Shack, the chain’s founding location and a crucial partner in the park’s finances, bustles tidily. Parents, whether of dogs or children, have nothing to complain about in the park’s runs and playground. Even pollinators are provided for, with five bee homes scattered amid the greenery. Meanwhile, unhoused people, at-risk youth, protestors, and hustlers have somehow been encouraged to stay six blocks south, in Union Square Park.The Madison Square Park Conservancy has been commissioning temporary art installations for the park since 2004. The signs for Brier Patch describe “the diverse range” of the program’s artists, while informing us that the work draws from Hayden’s “experience as an American and African American.” Within the well-patrolled boundaries of the park, where you are never far from a delicately worded fundraising appeal, it’s hard not to see Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling. Many of Hayden’s other works, which also make surreal modifications to everyday objects, have much more bite. His American Hero series, which began in 2010 with a taxidermized buffalo mount given cornrows, points out the concealment of Black contributions to foundational American history. A sculpture of a police car draped in a white sheet, 2021’s “Boogey Man,” denounces the white supremacist ideals that underlie police brutality. And Hayden has taken meaningful steps to help others enter the brier patch of the art world, for example by donating works to raise funds for tuition for Black MFA and art history students and persuading the Public Art Fund to expand what had been a solo commission into a group show for other young artists of color.But in the wealthy bubble of Madison Square Park, Brier Patch allows viewers to pat themselves on the back for their mere awareness of inequalities in our educational systems. The parents walking past who send their children to private schools are not made to question their decisions. The nannies whose own children are in sub-par public schools are not encouraged to protest that inequality. Everyone just gets to take nice Instagram photos, since the work does indeed, as my daughter said, look cool. Brier Patch is a temporary outdoor installation, not a public monument, and so I won’t judge it as one. But, as we debate what kinds of new monuments should be built to symbolize our changing understanding of our country, it can serve as a reminder to ask about who is paying. If a monument is seen as an amenity, it is likely to turn into something pleasing to the most influential and deep-pocketed members of a community, regardless of an artist’s intent. Hugh Hayden: Brier Patch continues at Madison Square Park (Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue between 23rd Street and 26th Street, Flatiron and NoMad, Manhattan) through May 1. The project was organized by Brooke Kamin Rapaport, Deputy Director and Martin Friedman Chief Curator; Tom Reidy, Deputy Director, Finance and Special Projects; and Truth Murray Cole, Curatorial Manager.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Previously by nomination only, the ARCAthens fully-funded residency is now open to all.Art.

Given at CUNY in 2018, the poet-classicist’s talk floatily triangulated between the introduction of a third actor in Sophoclean plays (corners move narrative forward), her father’s inability to orient himself amid mounting dementia (corners help us locate ourselves), and the corner as a form beyond the dialectic of inside and outside, or shelter and threat (corners are spatially distinct and psychologically freighted). I was drawn to the idea of moving the corner to the center, of recasting a space typically viewed as dustily incidental as a fulcrum of action.The gravity that Carson ascribes to corners sprang to mind when I encountered “Corner Basher” (1988), the first work — before the check-in desk, even — in Los Angeles-based sculptor Liz Larner’s most significant survey in more than 20 years, Liz Larner: Don’t put it back like it was at SculptureCenter. Among the earliest of the 28 artworks on view, which span from 1987 to 2021, “Corner Basher” activates a space that is normally invisible. The kinetic sculpture, which resembles a treacherous tetherball set, features a steel pole with a dangling metal ball hooked up to an electric motor. By flipping a switch and rotating a dial on an adjacent column, visitors to the space — with varying degrees of aggression, glee, and bemusement — can set the piece in motion, causing it to repeatedly wallop the walls of the corner in which it stands, at a range of velocities. As more people operate the machine over the course of time, the wall increasingly, incrementally, and a bit bathetically, crumbles into pieces on the floor. Conceived as a sly rejoinder to the macho-coded destructive robots of Mark Pauline’s performance collective Survival Research Laboratories, Larner’s collaborative “Corner Basher” literally lays the museum’s structure bare in a work of participatory institutional critique.In the nearby “Wrapped Corner” (1991), gleaming chains, turnbuckles, and brackets are kinkily pulled tight around the corner edge of a room in horizontal rows; “Too the Wall” (1990) features six delicately jointed steel and silver armatures, each holding a pale square of leather, suspended across a corner in increasingly taut tiers. These site-responsive drawings in space highlight the physical and social context in which the art and the viewer are situated, and, particularly by centering the anti-heroic corner, pose questions about the values that are reflected in both our built environments and the ways in which we move through those environments (or, show art in them). The feminist thrust of this undertaking is made overt in “Bird in Space” (1989): a reinterpretation of the (white, male) Romanian modernist Constantin Brancusi’s famous 1923 sculpture of a bird in flight, a pedestal-mounted phallic abstraction made from marble or bronze. Larner’s own abstract avian, its outstretched wings the size of the room, is constructed from bowed lengths of humble nylon cord held tensile between steel blocks. Slipping in and out of visibility based on the viewer’s position, this sweeping anti-monument asks gallery-goers to recognize where they stand and what they notice: to engage in the relatively unpolished and unsexy, intermittently rewarding, ongoing project of parsing the artworks’ nuances and thinking relationally.“I like to think of the viewer as more of a sensor, a being using every sense to understand an object,” said Larner in an interview with Mary Ceruti for the exhibition catalogue. Larner’s varied work allows us to feel our way toward meaning, often physically moving in the process. It can be difficult to identify, as the artist put it in a recent interview with Jeffrey Kastner, a traditional “throughline” in her oeuvre (despite the art historical record’s repeated attempts to shoehorn her into post-minimalism). The pieces in the show are wildly disparate, ranging from abstract to figurative and from microscopic to massive, executed in media as diverse as false eyelashes, bronze, porcelain, leather, and steel. They reflect a body of work with a slippery habit of shapeshifting, characterized by a commitment to an active viewing experience and materiality itself, rather than any one material or aesthetic.Larner, who graduated from CalArts with a BFA in photography in 1985, found her way to sculpture organically, via bacterial cultures that she had been cultivating with nutrient agar in petri dishes. Though she initially produced these experiments to photograph them, the artist became interested in letting them unfold as process works in three-dimensional space, giving rise to the cleverly titled Cultures series (1987-ongoing). In “Orchid, Buttermilk, Penny” (1987), the titular items decompose — altering one another’s chemical compositions in the process — in two petri dishes encased in glass atop a pedestal. “Primary, Secondary: Culture of Empire State Building and Twin Towers” (1988), a landscape to the former still life, is an architectonic glass-and-aluminum display of two petri dishes with colorful, crispy material grown from cultures taken at those corporate, seemingly inorganic locations. Exploring representation on a literal, material level, these works set biochemical assemblages into motion, evincing Larner’s early interest in sympoesis and an exploratory, collaborative approach to making that is also at the heart of “Corner Basher.”Encountering the solitary “smile (after dark)” (2009), a somewhat ominous, inky length of shiny porcelain upturned at the corners, conjures up Alice’s wonderment: “I’ve often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!” From 1996 to 2011, Larner labored on the smile series, a group of abstracted, disembodied grins made from casting foamcore forms in porcelain, a material also used in dental veneers. “smile (after dark)” is hollow, literally. Its unevenly faceted, intermittently lacerated surface makes it difficult to discern the inside from the outside (like a corner), prompting the viewer to scrutinize a detached gesture that is seen as shorthand for joy but so often contains grimacing gradations of ambivalence, obligation, resentment, or anger — perhaps particularly among people repeatedly told to smile.Larner, who lives and works in the birthplace of the anti-utilitarian California Clay Revolution, has since turned to the softer, more porous medium of ceramics, her focus throughout the past decade. Like the Cultures, ceramics inherently require the artist to cede a measure of authorship to nature and entropy: after the clay, teeming with microorganisms, is dug from the earth, worked, and shaped, it hardens into being in the kiln — cracking and warping as it sees fit — outside of the artist’s sight and out of her hands. A sequence of large, wall-mounted ceramic lozenges, begun in 2013, line a lower-level hallway. Glazed or painted in arresting hues and titled after geological phenomena, they include “subduction” (2013), a deep, shifting well of indigo; “inflexion” (2013), a blue morpho butterfly’s shimmering azure; and “vi (calefaction)” (2015), a navy ombre studded with chunky stones and minerals to a celestial effect. Alluding to the fault lines that run through fired clay and earth alike, each thick slab is intractably cracked, from hairline fissures and crumbling edges to clean rips down the middle, visual pauses that riff on Barnett Newman’s zip paintings. The viewer slips, unsettled, between art historical time and geological time; micro and macro; chance and intention; nature and culture. Through a longstanding practice of regarding her materials and audience as her co-creators, and approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment rather than a static or foreclosed object, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work. The inner unsteadiness — the searching — that this push-and-pull sets in motion is the main event.Liz Larner: Don’t put it back like it was continues at SculptureCenter (44-19 Purves St, Long Island City, Queens) through March 28 and will travel to the Walker Art Center (725 Vineland Place, Minneapolis, Minnesota) from April 30 to September 4.

The inaugural contemporary art fair, scheduled to take place this summer during the centennial Southwestern Association for Indian Arts’s Santa Fe Indian Market, has been billed as the first of its kind in the world, where contemporary Indigenous fine art galleries will gather for four days in New Mexico’s capital city. Martindale hopes to expand the Art Indigenous concept — which will feature sculpture, painting, photography, installation, and performance — to other cities.Martindale, who says that he produced the LA Art Show for a quarter-century, is a longtime worldwide art fair attendee. For years, the lack of global representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists nagged at him.“It doesn’t make sense,” he says. “Why isn’t there a show for contemporary artists from Indigenous lineage, and why don’t we see more of that art at some of these major shows?”Along with The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s inclusion of Native American art, Martindale says another milestone took place when the Upper East Side institution hired Patricia Marroquin Norby (Purépecha) as its first full-time curator of Native American art.“One thing led to another and now there’s a dialog in art museums saying that if you want to have a complete collection of American art, then you need Native American and Indigenous art in the US and Canada in your collection,” says Martindale. “I think this is all gelling together at this moment in time.”The idea for Art Indigenous Santa Fe took off due to the upcoming centennial anniversary of the Santa Fe Indian Market, which is scheduled to take place in an in-person format. The popular event, said to be North America’s largest and most important juried Indigenous art market, is helmed by Native American woman Kim Peone (Colville Confederated Tribes and Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians). The market, which has drawn upwards of 150,000 visitors to New Mexico’s capital city, features Native artists displaying and selling their works in and around the historic Santa Fe Plaza.Martindale was also encouraged to move forward after attending 2021 Art Basel Miami Beach in Florida. There, for the first time, he noticed that an installation and performance piece section of the fair included a Native American artist. “I thought, ‘Yes. Finally. It’s happening,’” he says.A partial list of participating Art Indigenous Santa Fe galleries is expected to be announced in April 2022; Martindale says the full roster, which he anticipates will be in the range of 30 to 40 galleries, will drop in May. An Art Indigenous Santa Fe preview event is scheduled from 6 to 10 pm on Thursday, August 18 at El Museo de Cultural de Santa Fe at the Railyard Arts District, and the show will run through Sunday, August 21.“We’re not taking away anything from Indian Market, but rather adding to Indian Market, and bringing in a whole other group of collectors that maybe wouldn’t come to town for Indian Market,” says Martindale. “With this gallery-oriented show, we’re presenting these artists that have not participated in Indian Market for years or never have.”It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Previously by nomination only, the ARCAthens fully-funded residency is now open to all.Art.

Two Athens residency fellowships will be available — one for a visual art fellow and the other for a curatorial fellow — and they will fully fund residents as they live and work in Athens for a duration of two months.Unlike previous years, when fellows were chosen by nomination, applicants from all countries are now welcome to apply, as long as they reside outside of Greece. The residency begins on September 19, 2022 and lasts until November 14. A total fellowship award of $2,000 will be granted to the two chosen fellows, along with a $150 weekly stipend and round trip airfare. The “live-work facilities” on offer include a “gorgeous neoclassical facility” operated by ARCAthens’ partner and contemporary arts organization ATOPOS; each fellow will be accommodated with a private bedroom, private studio, and shared kitchen, bathroom, dining room, and library.Past ARCAthens fellows include artists Tomashi Jackson and Cullen Washington, Jr., and curators Miranda Lash and Larry Ossei-Mensah. If accepted, fellows will be expected to participate in a seminar with students at the Athens School of Fine Arts and a public end-of-year residency event. “Athens is known for its ancient history, its radiant light, its delightful weather, gorgeous landscape, warm people, rich culture, and delicious food,” says ARCAthens Executive Director Aristides Logothetis in a statement. “Athens, which is also known as a destination for all things modern, is now becoming a vibrant hub of contemporary culture, providing our fellows with an additional lens from which to understand our world today.” ARCAthens also hosts a virtual residency, which began during the pandemic, in which a curator selects two artists — one from Greece and one from the Bronx, New York — to collaborate and exchange ideas through social media.

It seems that a decade of protest, and the example of several other museums cutting ties with the company, hasn’t changed anything — the museum is still performing gratitude to the oil giant for its generosity. There are so many things about the British Museum to criticize, but its complicity in BP’s artwashing ranks alongside the museum’s continual refusal to engage with its own colonial history and its total rejection of any requests for the repatriation of looted objects held in its collection. It’s these issues, and the connections between them, that are most significant — two high-profile movements that challenge the way we engage with the British Museum and have consequences that can be felt beyond its walls.There is, broadly, a disconnect between these movements. There are plenty of organizers who move between both spaces, but the public coverage and popular response tends to separate them. Talking about BP leads to the allegation that you’re ignoring the colonialist violence of the museum itself, while focusing on restitution is read as though you’re not thinking about the environmental impact of oil companies.Even as anti-colonial consciousness grows and there is a greater public awareness and involvement in campaigns for restitution, there’s a tendency to not see the modernity of this fight. It’s still bleakly common, even among people who are engaged with these conversations, to see the act of colonialism as an element of the past, and its consequences in the present, but not to consider the ways that colonial exploitation is still active. The language used by museums, the way imperialism is neatly sectioned off into history, the way institutions work to perpetuate the myth that these communities have simply faded passively away, the euphemisms around acquisitions, add to the impression that the actual moment of violence is over. We’re talking about the systematic displacement of communities from their homes, the destruction of cultural landscapes in the pursuit of profit, and the abuse of marginalized laborers to produce wealth in the cultural West. How can this be anything other than a continuation of colonialism?There is an incredible opportunity here for collaborations that can lead to real and meaningful change. In my own experience, it works both ways: People involved in climate justice campaigns are open to learning about the exclusionary history of these spaces, just as those who explore the racism and violence at a museum’s heart are able to consider modern forms of injustice and inequality. The trick, if you like, of museums is to collapse time, to shrink history and geography until we can see all things at once. This same compression can be an opportunity. The flattened structure of a museum works to create comparisons, and we can use those in building solidarity. The best tool at our disposal is context: showing the repetitions of history and exploring the parallels between the imperialist exploitation of people and extraction of resources and wealth, and the neo-colonial violence with which corporations carelessly destroy our environment in pursuit of profit.So how do we pull these threads together? Climate crisis disproportionately affects those who are already marginalized racially and economically, and it is crucial to keep in mind how that marginalization was created in the first place. The organization BP or Not BP has consistently worked to highlight the essentially neo-colonial nature of oil companies, and platform the voices of campaigners for restitution with their “Stolen Goods” tours, and interventions that contrast the BP-funded Stonehenge exhibition at the British Museum with the damage done by BP drilling into the petroglyphs at Murujuga on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia. The Stop Adani movement in Australia has also walked this line effectively so far. The Adani coal mines would devastate Wangan and Jagalingou lands, and displace communities in Godda to build power stations — an environmental issue that keeps the people most directly harmed at its center. And Members of the Indigenous communities impacted by these mines have led the campaign against Adani’s controversial sponsorship of the Science Museum’s “Green Energy Gallery,” emphasizing that this is cultural as well as environmental destruction.For historians and educators, there’s also a responsibility to address the deeper history of artwashing. The wealthy individuals who influenced the British Museum’s collections and curatorial narratives in the 19th century have their parallels in the sketchy Chairman’s Advisory Group, a group of anonymous representatives from massive corporations who have an unofficial role in steering the museum’s decisions today. Museums under capitalism can’t be completely divorced from these financial influences, but they can at least be transparent about them, and they have to expect that they’ll face scrutiny for them.Pulling these threads together is crucial. A change in sponsorship without the restitution of stolen objects would be inadequate, just as engaging in anticolonial work without considering modern forms of destruction and marginalization is meaningless. We need both, together. The museum is not a space of equality — it’s governed by uneven power and shaped by privilege, not a reflection of the world around it; nor is it an institution that consistently serves the public. This inequality is obvious to anyone kept away from their own cultural heritage by its cabinets. For those who don’t personally experience the museum’s inequality, or don’t see it as immediately affecting them, being able to point to these concrete examples of deception and complicity can help us bridge the gap. The energy and creativity of climate justice protests combined with the rigor and determination of anticolonial movements is formidable. With solidarity and effort, it could be transformative.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

So are we.</description><text>Hyperallergic					Sensitive to Art &amp; its Discontents				War is raging, oceans are burning, and the breaking news you’ve been waiting for is finally here: The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute Benefit (better known as The Met Gala) will return to its traditional spot on the first Monday of May, and this year’s chairpeople and theme have been announced! If you’re unfamiliar with the Met Gala, it’s an annual event that raises funding for the museum’s Costume Institute by encouraging the rich and famous to wear outrageous, themed costumes in a world-class menagerie of peacocking. We’re talking single-use fashion but make at six figures.This year’s theme is “In America: An Anthology of Fashion,” which follows last year’s “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” as a two-part series that focuses on the storied history of American fashion. That’s despite the fact that the United States has been around for less than 250 years, and spent much of that time importing fashion from France and England.Queen of meatpacking pic.twitter.com/5I0r600RA9But perhaps the Met Gala felt the need to simplify things a little bit after the gala’s 2019 theme “What is Camp?” was met with a resounding sense that no one was really sure what it meant. But even the “In America” theme leaves plenty of room for controversy. Who can forget Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s dress from last year, emblazoned with “TAX THE RICH” and dripping with irony? According to reporting by the New York Times, designers and corporate sponsors generally cover the event’s $35,000 a ticket (or $200,000 to $300,000 for a table) for the gala’s guests, while NYC elected officials are special guests of the museum and do not pay to attend.“In America: An Anthology of Fashion traces the emergence of a distinct American style, revealing underlying stories that often go unrecognized,” said Max Hollein, the Met’s director, in a statement. “As a whole, this ambitious two-part exhibition ignites timely conversations about the tremendous cultural contributions of designers working in the United States and the very definition of an American aesthetic.”The evening’s official co-chairs are Hollywood stars Regina King, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. They will host an evening that features the second installment of the exhibition series, displaying approximately 100 fashion items dating from the 19th to the mid-to-late 20th-century. The garments will be presented throughout the Met’s American Wing period rooms, placing them in the context of more than a century of American domestic life, in an attempt to frame an “identifiable American style.” I’m imagining blue jeans.The exhibition will also be punctuated by eight fictional cinematic vignettes, or “freeze frames,” within each room, created by filmmakers Janicza Bravo, Sofia Coppola, Julie Dash, Tom Ford, Martin Scorsese, Autumn de Wilde, Chloé Zhao, and King. Drawing a connection between fashion and Hollywood certainly underscores the incredible impact of movie-making on fashion as a cultural beacon.Those with a hankering for fashion and celebrity will surely be tuning in to see all the hottest “lewks” being served up by the glitterati. Our eyes will especially be peeled for statement pieces in which famous people try to make the current state of world crisis somehow all about them. It will be a season to remember! You know, until the next one!It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

She also said that Ukrainian officials were working with UNESCO to distinguish cultural heritage sites with the Blue Shield emblem to afford them with enhanced protection status. If such sites are granted this status, their destruction would constitute evidence of a war crime. Attacks in Ukraine have already decimated several churches, and many Ukrainians are scrambling to evacuate treasured artifacts that are at high risk of destruction in future strikes. Earlier this week, on March 16, a theater in the eastern port city of Mariupol that sheltered at least 1,000 civilians was bombed by Russian forces; it remains unclear how many were killed in the attack. A museum in the town of Ivankiv near Kyiv, housing a number of works by the artist Maria Pryimachenko, was bombed on February 28. Many Ukrainians see such callous neglect of its heritage as part and parcel of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nationalistic campaign to deny Ukraine of its cultural specificity, and hence sovereignty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has contended that the Kremlin is intent on the “erasure” of Ukraine as an independent sovereign state.With the prospect of a coordinated assault on Ukrainian cultural treasures on the horizon, civilian documentation of the destruction of cultural heritage is encouraged. Despite its cautionary statement on broadcasting information on efforts to salvage Ukrainian heritage properties, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy recently rolled out a website where those who have witnessed cultural crimes across Ukraine are asked to submit photo and video evidence. Lazare Eloundou, head of Unesco’s World Heritage Centre, reported that the agency was increasingly receiving reports about the destruction of cultural heritage in several cities, and that its officials were working closely with local cultural professionals to develop an “action plan.” It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

That building, designed by Jorge Machado Moreira, housed the University of Architecture and Urbanism, whose Research and Documentation Center — or Núcleo de Pesquisa e Documentação (NPD)  — contained archival equipment like cameras, scanners, and computers. It also held over 50,000 documents and 5,000 photographs recording more than 150 years of Brazilian architectural history. The papers included those associated with Brazilian modernist architects such as Lúcio Costa, Affonso Eduardo Reidy, Roberto Burle Marx, and Moreira himself, as well as Europeans like Le Corbusier.Earlier this month, the Getty Foundation granted $240,000 to the NPD to restore the archives damaged by the fire, which started in an air-conditioning unit. Founded in 1982, the NPD was established with the purpose of collecting documents important to the architectural history of Brazil.“These collections are considered the most important architectural archives of modern Brazil’s Carioca School, so the conservation and long-term care of these priceless items is our highest priority,” Andrés Martín Passaro, an NPD coordinator, said in a statement. The Escola Carioca, a group of architects active from 1930 to 1960, drew inspiration from modernists like Le Corbusier while hybridizing that style with Luso-Brazilian elements. For 18 months, a team of conservators and an archivist will work with students in the Conservation and Restoration department at the Escola de Belas Artes and the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism to restore the collections. This will involve preventative measures like situating them in a new temperature-stabilized environment, while assessing the condition of what remains and keeping up-to-date records on a database. Students and staff will also be trained in best practices for the conservation of the roughly 38,500 objects that survive.“While soot and water permanently harmed a significant number of items and the Center is now unusable, we can take comfort in knowing the bulk of our collection will be given a new home with suitable environmental conditions,” Passaro continued.In recent years, preventable blazes at Brazil’s museums and cultural institutions have occurred with upsetting regularity. In 2018, a fire at Brazil’s National Museum eviscerated 90% of its collection, destroying one of the largest museums of natural history and anthropology in the Americas overnight. Among the many artifacts damaged were “Luzia,” the oldest human fossil in the Americas, and the most extensive Egyptian collection in the Americas. In July 2021, a fire enveloped the Cinemateca Brasileira, Brazil’s foremost archive for film and television — an inevitability that many had apprehensively predicted given deep budget cuts and an observable pattern of negligence toward arts and culture under the governing regime.The grant is the latest one in Getty’s Keeping it Modern initiative, which supports conservation efforts for modernist buildings worldwide. The conservation of the site of the NPD is important not only because it represents a significant building preservation in its own right. Its materials are additionally critical to preservation professionals, who “rely on collections like these to care for modern buildings,” São Paulo-based preservation architect Silvio Oksman said in the statement. Getty indicated in a press release that it is currently doing conservation work on 77 sites, a majority of which “involve the development of conservation management plans that draw heavily on archival materials such as those housed in the Jorge Machado Moreira building.”It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Cumbo will succeed Gonzalo Casals, who stepped down at the end of Bill de Blasio’s mayoral term in 2021 and joined the Mellon Foundation as a senior research and policy fellow.Last December, Cumbo voiced opposition to legislation that allows nearly one million noncitizens living in New York to vote in municipal elections, arguing that it would “shift the power dynamics” in the city to the disadvantage of its Black residents.“We do not have the numbers or the information to know how that is going to impact African-American communities who have been the most vulnerable in our existence in our city,” Cumbo told Politico. “Laurie Cumbo has a recent record of anti-immigrant statements &amp; policy positions. Her appointment is another deeply troubling sign that @NYCMayor is choosing intolerant political loyalists instead of listening to our communities.” -Our @NatyAristiBetahttps://t.co/FEavbenhO6The comment drew ire from supporters of the legislation and immigration advocates including Luis Miranda, a political strategist and father of award-winning composer and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. “I am sorry but Ms. Cumbo’s recent anti-immigrant statements make it very difficult for me to support her appointment,” Luis Miranda wrote in an email to members of Mayor Eric Adams’s transition committee in January, when there was first talk of Cumbo being named commissioner.“Her appointment is another deeply troubling sign that @NYCMayor is choosing intolerant political loyalists instead of listening to our communities,” said Natalia Aristizabal, the deputy director of the immigration advocacy group Make the Road New York, in a tweet shared by the organization.Cumbo is a longtime and fervent supporter of Adams, who has defended her potential nomination. “Laurie’s a superstar, and I love Laurie,” he told Politico in January. Born and raised in Brooklyn, Cumbo earned an undergraduate degree in Art History from Spelman College and an MA in Visual Arts Administration from New York University. A member of the city council from 2014 to 2021 representing its 35th district ⁠— which covers several Brooklyn neighborhoods including Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill ⁠— Cumbo also founded the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts in Fort Greene in 1999. In 2017, Cumbo successfully sponsored a legislative package that increased funding for the Percent for Art program, a public art initiative administered by the DCLA. At the time, it was the largest package of bills in the history of the agency. She also supported and passed legislation to create the first-ever citywide Minority and Women-Owned Businesses Task Force. In a press release shared by DCLA today, several leaders of cultural institutions across the city,  including the Laundromat Project and the Brooklyn Arts Council, praised the former councilwoman and welcomed the appointment.“Laurie Cumbo has been a tireless advocate for arts and culture organizations and, more particularly, organizations led by people of color,” said Melody Capote, executive director of the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute.But critics of Cumbo cite her record of culturally insensitive and polarizing statements that appear to pit ethnic groups against one another. In 2013, she apologized for writing in a Facebook post that “the accomplishments of the Jewish community triggers feelings of resentment” among her constituents. The comment was made in the wake of a series of attacks on Jewish residents of Crown Heights and was interpreted by many as anti-Semitic. In 2015, Cumbo also apologized for expressing concerns over “blocs” of Asian Americans moving into public housing in her district during a council hearing.At the height of Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, Cumbo, who is Black, compared calls to defund the police to “colonization” and said the movement was led primarily by White progressives.The DCLA is the largest cultural funding agency in the United States, providing hundreds of millions of dollars to more than 1,000 arts and culture nonprofits across all five boroughs of New York City.“I thank Mayor Eric Adams for appointing me to this position. Together, we will center the arts in New York’s economic recovery and bolster the educational and cultural experiences of every New York City student from Pre-K to CUNY,” Cumbo said in the DCLA’s statement. Echoing Adams’s tough-on-crime rhetoric, she added: “I also believe we can help address public safety issues in New York City — taking a gun out of the hands of a young person and replacing it with an instrument, paintbrush, camera, or script will redirect the talent and passions of our youth towards building a better and more vibrant New York City.” It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

The press for Tate Britain’s show Hogarth and Europe initially intrigues by promising to look at him in context with his European counterparts for the first time, “[exploring] the parallels and exchanges that crossed borders and the cosmopolitan character of [his] art.” While contemporary Britain is feeling the economic pinch from Brexit turmoil, this statement from curators Alice Insley and Martin Myrone sounds like a canny echo of pro-European Union sentiments.However, a different topical issue emerges as the primary reason for contextualizing Hogarth and Europe — that of societal inequality, racism, sexism, and colonialism. UK institutions are increasingly looking inward to examine their colonial pasts and links to slavery. Museum officials are rethinking ways to present the visual content of their collections, much of which perpetuates outdated and, at times, condemnable societal attitudes, and commissioning reports to identify where institutions have benefited from colonialism and slavery. In this spirit, we are invited to consider Hogarth’s period of Enlightenment during the 18th century as having ideals “produced by, and [which] benefited, white men from the middle and upper classes. The concept of European superiority deepened, entrenching ideas about nation, personal identity, and racial difference, manifested in the horrors of transatlantic slavery.”It is unfortunate, then, that a heavy-handed approach to this project, combined with a lack of focus, sorely undermines the curators’ honorable intentions. This is the first exhibition I have seen in which the lead curators write the main wall captions, but an additional group of “commentators” has been formed to lend “perspective and expertise” in smaller captions. These include various art historians, artists, and conservationists, as well as the Museum Detox Interpretation Group, a body composed of people of color who work in museums and heritage and who seek to champion diversity in the arts. At best, the additional commentary is insightful and provides jumping off points for discussion, or highlights the significance of minor characters who are peripheral in the compositions. Issues arise, however, when it becomes too speculative — for instance, imagining the thoughts of marginalized figures in the artworks (often people of color) — or forces the agenda beyond provability. Next to Hogarth’s “The Distressed Poet” (1733-35), for example, is a caption by Lars Tharp that homes in on the presence of porcelain and tea imported from Asia (specifically a red teapot that is “probably Chinese”), all of which are almost impossible to make out in the image itself — other visitors I noticed also struggled to find these items. This reading ignores the main focus, which is a poet slumped over his latest work in a decrepit bedsit, neglecting his family, and the presence of a milkmaid demanding an unpaid bill, in favor of barely visible tropes of colonialist expansion in tea and porcelain. Other details, such as a cupboard empty save for a mouse, and a dog stealing food from the family’s plate, clearly emphasize the primary satirical focus on the social and romantic pretensions of the aspiring poet at the expense of feeding his family and paying those who serve him.It is actually a curious paradox that because the curators seek to find commonalities between Hogarth and his European contemporaries with the purpose of highlighting societal inequality, as well as exploitation and privilege resulting from slavery across the board, the exhibition might as well not be about Hogarth at all. This is unfortunate, as it is the most comprehensive collection of his art likely to be assembled for years to come; it includes 60 works, among them private loans and pieces from the US, notably the gorgeous portrait of “Miss Mary Edwards” (1742) from the Frick in New York. The last room is filled with many portraits examining a trend toward depicting greater humanity in wealthy sitters, yet the question of inequality is again forced with this opaque explanation: “Sometimes, where these images suggest subjectivities rejected or compromised by the dominant ideas about race, class and gender, they hint at the unfulfilled promises and contradictions of modern European society.” A valid point is hovering around in this ambiguous language, but the dense academic prose seems to sidestep direct address of wealth and privilege. Yet what most complicates the attempt to both unify Hogarth and European artists and highlight outdated depictions is the question of satire, and how he used it. Take “Southwark Fair” (1733), which depicts a fair that was held around Borough High Street every year until its abolition in 1762, and was often a scene of violence and impropriety. It is crammed with innumerable details of cartoonish figures engaged in revelry; on the far right a stage collapses under the weight of actors in a moment of chaos. Among the crowd are figures watching a peepshow, a dwarf playing bagpipes, and, in a clear indication of society gone topsy-turvy, a dog dressed as a gentleman and walking on its hind legs. It is demonstrably a wry condemnation of polite society breaking down with the excuse of a festival. Adjacent to the dog is a Black man playing a trumpet. The curators’ caption posits a deliberate parallel between the dog dressed as a gentleman and the trumpeter, indicating that while “mocking social class” it nonetheless “signals deepening ideas of racial difference pervasive in 18th Century culture.” There is no further comment given to support this reading, so it remains more a suggested interpretation than an overwhelmingly convincing example of outright racism within Hogarth’s work. As the curators have centered inequality in 18th-century European society throughout the survey, satire promises a more productive way into the subject than simply looking out for evidence of colonialist tropes such as tea and porcelain or tobacco, coffee, and sugar — “[latent] elements of exploitation and subjection” — in Hogarth’s “A Midnight Modern Conversation” (shown at the Tate in a copy after the lost original). This is not to deny the recognition of such items as evidencing horrific exploitation in their production, but focusing on such items threatens to sideline the potential for a more complex discussion. (Ironically, the attention to satire highlights how distinct Hogarth is from his European contemporaries, whose works on view never achieve his capacity for nuanced satire.)Far from simply recording things as they appeared, Hogarth’s exaggerated compositions and other satirical elements are active commentaries meant to provoke thought. The introductory text says the works shown “express a critical view of society, but they also reveal the entrenchment of racist, sexist, and xenophobic stereotypes. Artists may have celebrated individuality, but they also made representations of people that are disturbing or dehumanising.” Within Hogarth it is this tangling of the exaggerated grotesquery of satire and the recording of figures informed by entrenched racist perceptions of the time that problematizes any straightforward interpretation of his images.The section on “A Modern Midnight Conversation” questions whether this image of white men falling about dunk, in various versions with Black slaves in attendance, is a moralizing condemnation of vice and the material mores of a society benefiting from slavery, or actually a gentle and affectionate ribbing of the behaviors of this strata of society, in which Hogarth was trying to ingratiate himself. In this instance we may see Hogarth as complicit in perpetuating colonialist stereotypes of slavery and oppression.If the overarching aim of this show is, as it seems, to uncover and belatedly condemn the racist elements of these artworks, it misses an important point. Yes, much of the art contains unacceptable imagery as it reflects social and racial hierarchies of the time. But why assemble the most significant grouping of Hogarths from far and wide simply to sweep it wholesale into this bucket, without indicating why calling out the faults in historical artworks is important to our understanding of our world today? Or, likewise, discussing the ambiguity of satire, which allows the artist to position himself as an external critic and be complicit in the critiqued acts. This same positional ambiguity enables much ingrained racism and white privilege still. It is a fact that social systems, and thus daily lives, in the UK and abroad are shaped by the horrors of slavery and colonialism, but in seeking out and condemning artifacts from the past the curators of this and similarly themed exhibitions risk historicizing racism. Rather, we should relate it to today’s very real and still entrenched racism and sexism. In short, what can we learn from these artworks if we hold them up as mirrors?It is never a pleasure to address curatorial missteps when an exhibition has at its center a very urgent and honorable desire to condemn outdated racist views and stereotypes. Despite its shortcomings and sometimes muddled delivery, we should nonetheless admire the curators’ effort to reevaluate Hogarth whom, for a long while, has received a free pass under the all-forgiving umbrella of “satire.” One of British art’s most revered eccentric characters should not be exempt from criticism and the curators should be credited for creating a conversation around the issue in the first place. An important takeaway from the show is the encouragement more than ever to consider the societal and historical context in which art is made; in short, not to simply take its message at face value, which is a core principle of investigative art history.Hogarth and Europe continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through March 20.

This became obvious when I saw the exhibition Harriet Korman: New Work at Thomas Erben Gallery (February 24–April 9, 2022), her fourth with the gallery. To further define the singularity of Korman’s achievement, in contrast to many other abstract artists of her generation (she was born in the 1940s) who have been in pursuit of color, she does not nod to pop culture in her color choices, nor does she have a signature structure into which she drops her hues. Rather, she works in distinct series without any ostensible subject matter. As a consequence, she has not developed either a signature style or palette, those conventional access points the art world seems to crave. She wants the viewer to have a more direct and open encounter with her work, which is a seldom-traveled road these days. As Korman states in the gallery press release:In this current series, I drew to find a form I wanted to work with. These drawings are not studies, I consider drawing to be an equal practice to painting and value them as such. While drawing, I chose a very simple, familiar form of concentric rectangles because it seemed like it would be an interesting challenge. I took that form into painting without referring to the drawings, and later used the drawings as sources for the paintings.Later, she adds:I try to capture the dynamic in the drawings; the color relationships, the proportions, the movement — what attracts me in the drawing, not copy it. This interpolation has many obstacles, pitfalls, inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies, but ultimately is very engaging.Korman’s interest in proportion and movement are key to the dynamic relationships that she articulates in the recent paintings. While the paintings share the formal element of concentric rectangles there is nothing formulaic about what she does; each painting comes across as distinct, hard earned, and, at times, it seems almost rudimentary. Many artists who explore color and geometry produce variations on a form or a palette, but this is never the case with Korman. You might think that she would settle into habits but she never does. I cannot stress how fresh and exciting this is. For one thing, each painting comes across as individual and specific, rather than as a variation on a pre-established form or another fill-in-the-colors version of geometric abstraction. By designating each work as “untitled,” she shortens the distance between the viewer and the art by avoiding any detours through language and its attendant associations.  The freshness of these paintings is a result of Korman starting with oil stick drawings, which are meant to stand on their own, and do. In the drawings, she proceeds improvisationally: each color rectangle and the space it takes up determines what happens next. The width of the framing rectangles is markedly different and follows no pattern. The drawings work incrementally, in a process of adding without erasing or covering over one color with another that has its roots in Jackson Pollock and his poured paintings. Each drawing becomes a possible structure to explore. The shift from oil stick drawing to oil painting, as well as the change in scale, evokes the legendary jazz pianist Art Tatum improvising Vincent Youmans’s “Tea for Two.” While respecting the original song, he makes it into something all his own. When the drawings and paintings are in close proximity, it becomes apparent how much Korman has transformed one thing into another, always while respecting the nature of her materials, the porous density of the oil stick, and the smooth solidity of the oil paint. At the same time, there are a number of artists working this way — in which color calls to color — but I can’t think of anyone as sensitive to the internal dynamics of proportion and density, and of the weight of one color against another, as Korman. These concerns, and her ability to trust her decisions without going back into the work, as if a perfect resolution existed, are why these paintings never become formulaic. Look at the ones on the gallery’s longest wall and you will see that the proportions within the paintings’ rectangles change and she does not work on an equally sized format: she is not programming her work according to consumers’ desire for dependability. In recent years Korman has worked with saturated colors, so her use of browns and chartreuse signal something new in her work. In the case of brown, she uses it as a neutral (neither warm nor cool), causing the other colors to gain in strength, or places two different tones in close proximity. In fact, while I was scrutinizing the paintings, both up close and from a distance, I realized that I kept doing something that I rarely do in an exhibition. I repeatedly stood back and gazed at a group of paintings, seeing what they shared and what distinguished them, and taking particular notice of how the density of the colors changed from work to work. It is so easy to overlook this crucial difference between Korman’s art and that of other artists who, for example, work within a grid structure. Korman’s geometric abstractions make those of other artists seem flabby. With many geometric abstract artists the similarities among their paintings far outweigh the differences. That this never happens with Korman’s paintings should clue you into what is remarkable about them — for which she should receive more recognition. Each painting possesses a quietly unique identity. When she uses two yellows in a painting, as in “Untitled” (2021, oil on canvas, 48 by 60 inches), they are not the same, but it’s the colors between them, and the width of each separating band, that makes their difference visually momentous. Walter Pater famously said, “All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.” Korman’s paintings exist in a musical state; they compose an intuitively orchestrated set of optical vibrations that synthesize contrast and tonal shifts, large and small intervals, by underscoring difference. She brings together different clusters and tones, some sharply contrasting and other tonally shifting. Sometimes the interval between related tones is marked by contrasting colors. And even within the internal configuration Korman will do something unexpected, such as frame the contrasting color with a wide and a very narrow band. The overall effect is that a viewer is continuously pulled into the paintings, and will begin to notice the internal harmonies and dissonances, and how they fit together without becoming subsumed into an overarching pattern. At one point, I limited my focus to the edges of the concentric rectangle, and how some were curved, which made the concentric planes appear as if they were billowing. Then I began accounting for all that was not a concentric rectangle: a floating, diagonal, yellow-orange brushstroke within the deep orange rectangle in the center of the painting, a brown line within the narrow, red, centered lozenge-like rectangle. We are not meant to see Korman’s paintings all at once. The kind of looking her paintings and drawings demand, and should receive, is slow. As we become more attuned to her decisions, we may realize that we cannot ascribe any other motivation than the pursuit of a unique color sensation. It is a harder goal to achieve than one might think, and Korman is one of the few who has never made a signature form, or developed a market-driven aesthetic, within that domain. Harriet Korman: New Work continues at Thomas Erben Gallery (526 West 26th Street, floor 4, Chelsea, Manhattan) through April 9.

For visitors who can still catch this breezy, trippy show before it wraps up its six-week-long run this Saturday, figuring out the title’s significance from the works themselves can be more rewarding than relying on the autobiographical explanation. Byrne’s nattily sketched word associations, surreal cartoons, and thought diagrams — also collected in A History of the World (in Dingbats) Drawings and Writings David Byrne (Phaidon Press 2022) — nod to art making as high-spirited brainstorming and insightful deviations. The fact that mental detours serve as this show’s unifying theme will be no surprise to any visitor with passing knowledge of Byrne’s multimedia career. Like the drawings and writings at Pace, Byrne’s output has involved creative sleights of hand that only appear effortless due to decades of savvy refinement. From his days as a two-time art college dropout turned frontman and chief songwriter for the punk-era juggernaut the Talking Heads to his current Broadway turn deconstructing the pop concert into postmillennial musical theater through the stripped down, gymnastic choreography of American Utopia, Byrne exploits our country’s homegrown conventions. His subject matter ranges from advertising bromides to self-help talk to religious fundamentalist exhortations, their languages reframed into funkier, more skewed grooves and configurations that — like these spur-of-the-moment drawings and pictographs — make America’s delusional optimism seem credible again. Byrne’s public reputation for proposing counterintuitive hopefulness provides another subtext in How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic. Although he enjoys a celebrity’s comfortable perch in gentrified New York, the artist has publicly inveighed, insightfully and determinedly, against the city’s ongoing encrustation in Midas gold. In response, less famous and well-connected fellow artists — including some in this publication — have charged him with ignoring creative communities and cultural initiatives thriving beyond Gotham’s gilded zip codes. But living in the glass house of an elite Manhattan gallery, as Byrne does, doesn’t mean you can’t throw rhetorical stones at the creepy commodification of nearly every facet of daily American life, provided you aim those objections at the right agents.That’s not to say this exhibition is political. It isn’t. But there’s more than a winking nod to the inbuilt contradiction in showing unassuming drawings and writings — most made spontaneously by Byrne with a mere pen or pencil on archival paper — in an elite art gallery with global outposts. Set directly across from the ostentatious Chelsea skyline visible through the gallery’s 7th-floor skylights and ceiling-to-floor windows, Byrne’s small-scaled and spare drawings — many dating from the city’s grueling lockdown period in 2020 — may remind us (and maybe reminded the artist as well) that art can be created wherever you find yourself entombed, and by using whatever tools you have in that bunker.So, is Byrne’s art any good? Stylistically, the best drawings and most interesting verbal pictographs land somewhere between the interrogative visual adventures in Saul Steinberg’s virtuosic drawings and the sometimes overhyped calisthenics of Keith Haring’s charming silhouettes. As the exhibition spotlights the most rudimentary level of Byrne’s visual repertoire, it’s akin to observing, in any given city or small town, a daydreaming bus passenger with pen in hand, drawing or scribbling excitedly in a moleskin notebook. So the “non-rational logic” to which Byrne alludes is the fertile mindlessness that goes into making art on an everyday basis. And so Byrne shows that the pen has reasons that reason can never know. A still-life doodle of a woolen winter cap can metamorphose hairy human limbs and look ready to take a winter’s walk. A self-assured pigeon gazing into its wardrobe mirror can see its neurotic human double staring back with reciprocal envy or admiration for what they both almost are, or aren’t. Visual engimas like these play out through the drawings’ consistently disarming humor. What causes the agony in Byrne’s Mr. Potato Head as he grimaces and rears backward on skinny avian legs? Is the giant finger reaching down for a pill-sized smart phone that of a postmodern Gulliver, texted by Lilliputians who miss his company? Some of the works that include writing — especially the wall-sized mural that dominates the exhibition space — represent Byrne scattering and then rearranging cultural code words and familial or social labels. One drawing shows that a cocktail bar’s taxonomies can be as intellectually productive as a chemist’s periodic table. Other word associations are set within the roots and branches of trees to reveal how pre-given categories can, without much conscious thought, outgrow or uproot former hierarchies; still other pictorial lists show how the subconscious mind classifies and distorts markers of human progress or worldly success. Stop making sense, Byrne famously sings in the Talking Heads’ underground dance hit “Girlfriend Is Better” (1982). And in the American decades since Byrne first plied his musical trade in New York’s squalid Lower East Side clubs — in a far more egalitarian economy than ours and in a city that then had an undeniably more diverse, de-institutionalized artistic ecosystem — the willfully ignorant among us have increasingly seized power by denying empirical facts while claiming to be most enlightened, turning rationality ever more on its aching head.  So this lightheartedness is a tonic for our times even as the exhibition poses a serious question: Can the simplest gestures in art and writing revive optimism amid the dangerous nonsense and simplifications that pass for cultural and intellectual exchanges these days? In the liner notes to his album American Utopia (2018) Byrne, in the pre-pandemic Trump-era, comes close to eulogizing that American tradition of hope, before returning to the premise that “to be descriptive is to be prescriptive.” If you unpack that sentiment further in light of these drawings and writings, it’s less a naïve platitude than it sounds. And it makes me wonder what else art is for, but to remind us that what we call “being reasonable” is too often our expedient alibi for not using our imagination.David Byrne: How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic continues at Pace Gallery (540 West 25th Street, Chelsea, Manhattan) through March 19.

Hutson grew up in the strictly segregated city of San Marcos, Texas in the 1930s and ’40s, where art was one of many things that were off limits to non-White citizens. “I was born and raised in an environment where there were no incentives that would lead me to visual [or] fine arts,” Hutson told Hyperallergic in a recent email. “If there was a gallery, museum or visual art venue,” he explained, “I would not have had access to it as non-white people in that town at that time could not have gone to such places without going there to either clean the bathroom, wash the windows or mop the floor.” The Art of Bill Hutson in San Marcos is a long overdue, city-wide tribute to the artist’s innovative work, and his will to overcome challenges despite great odds. Curated and organized by Margo Handwerker, the Chief Curator and Director of the Texas State Galleries at Texas State University, and Linda Kelsey-Jones, the university’s Community Arts Coordinator, Hutson’s first exhibition in Texas presents more than 60 works across five venues, including The Calaboose African American History Museum, The Price Center, The San Marcos Art Center, Texas State Galleries, and Walkers’ Gallery at the San Marcos Public Library. The exhibition offers viewers a rare chance to survey Hutson’s prolific and varied output. It’s also a frank and sincere gesture towards reconsidering the city’s relationship to its own history with regards to race.Hutson was born in San Marcos in 1936. His father died when the artist was only five, so he and his siblings took on agricultural and construction jobs in addition to their school work to help out. The young Hutson found visual inspiration nearby. “I was attracted to cartoons as our house, a shotgun house, had wallpaper that was actually newspaper,” Hutson said by email. “In this way all during my childhood I saw cartoons and sometimes I would draw and copy them.” Hutson saw his first painting on the campus of Texas State University, where he helped his mother at her job as a custodial worker. Still, Huston told Hyperallergic, “I was nearly an adult before I became aware of fine art.”The turn to artmaking came after Hutson had finished high school and served in the US Air Force. He moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s, where he attended an art school and worked as a studio assistant to the artist Frank N. Ashley. In 1963, Hutson moved to New York City, where he joined the vibrant art scenes of SoHo and Midtown Manhattan. Over the next 40 years, the artist lived and exhibited between the US, Europe, and Africa. Hutson now lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where his art and archives are housed in the permanent collection of the Phillips Museum at Franklin &amp; Marshall College.The cornerstone piece of the city-wide presentation is “Homestead with signs, symbols and numbers” (1979-1990), a roughly seven- by nine-foot canvas at Texas State Galleries. Crucially, Handwerker has included two preparatory sketches for the work, as well as the artist’s model of his childhood home. Each of these elements helps the viewer to decode Hutson’s complex constellation of signs that stand for the racial topography of the San Marcos of his youth, where African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans were prohibited from visiting downtown, using most public facilities, and frequently threatened with violence. In one drawing, for example, we see Hutson exploring themes of ownership, belonging, and space as he writes the names of local indigenous populations who have inhabited the region for centuries. He later references these groups in an abstracted painted teepee.The work is also technically layered. Hutson’s thick, swirling passages of acrylic paint are carefully bound by sharp, angular edges. His shapes float over a textured green background treated with the artist’s “bind-stain-release-flatten” technique, in which the canvas is condensed, dyed, and then stretched onto a frame. The method appears in several of Hutson’s other pieces, along with sewing, 3D elements, and other interventions that alter the very fabric and structure of the work itself. Here Hutson seems to be challenging painting as a surface and concept. Other works are made up of moveable, modular components that can be configured freely.Ultimately, the piece embodies what Hutson calls the “tragic paradox of ‘home,” where a point of origin is also a place of, in the artist’s words, “oppression, bondage and insecurity.” This complicated ambivalence makes this homecoming all the more important.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

On Reddit’s “Buy It for Life” forum, for instance, they’ll find users showing off a Soviet-era toaster, a restored vintage Sunbeam, and other toasters to “grow old with,” as one put it. Brereton’s post–which ended “Google is dead. Long live Google + ‘site:reddit.com’ ”—became the No. 10 most upvoted link ever on the tech-industry discussion board Hacker News. No. 11 is a complaint about Google’s search results looking too similar to its ads, while No. 12 is a link to an alternative, indie search engine. Clearly, others share Brereton’s sense of search-engine discontentment.Sportswashing is the practice of laundering one’s reputation through sports; whether that be through team ownership, hosting a major tournament, or sponsorship. A country or politician gets involved with the hope that some of the sport’s popularity will improve their image.As the world’s most popular sport, soccer is an effective vehicle for sportswashing. Saudi Arabia recently purchased English Premier League team Newcastle United. Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was trying to sell London’s Chelsea F.C. before the British government sanctioned him.When the British entered the Benin Oba (King’s) palace, they found “several hundred unique bronze plaques, suggestive of almost Egyptian design, but of really superb casting,” according to Reginald Bacon, an intelligence officer with the expedition. Soldiers walked out with the plaques, along with other art, ivory, brass, jewelry and garments. Thousands of pieces were taken.They were “not just loot, they were blood art,” Australian journalist Marc Fennell explained on the podcast “Stuff the British Stole.” Indeed, word was sent back to Britain that selling off Benin’s objects could help offset the cost of the war.In New York City, the police commissioner can and often does choose to ignore the results of CCRB-brought disciplinary trials. The commissioner can ignore guilty pleas and can even decide there should be no trial at all, as appears to be happening in this case. Last year, the police commissioner followed through on the CCRB’s discipline recommendations in serious cases just 27% of the time.I sent the NYPD a series of questions, asking both about its power to ignore the CCRB and about how that power has been wielded in this case. I got a one-sentence response: “The disciplinary process is ongoing.”We do know something about what’s happened to the officers, and about their records. Thanks to legislation that New York state passed in the summer of 2020, police records are no longer secret. The CCRB’s report names the officers involved.Trump’s rise largely coincided with a push and pull over American exceptionalism that has now outlasted his presidency. Sides are not clean, are not divided by party or political orientation. The debate concerns not just what the United States is and can be, but in fact what this or any country can represent to its citizens and to the world. On the one hand are the exceptionalists—those who hold faith in an America that is unique in the world and destined for greatness. Opposing the exceptionalists are a motley crew spread across right, left, and center who argue that America is, even beyond Trump’s relatively amoral formulation, a force for ill. Let’s call this inchoate ideology counter-exceptionalism. It’s not anti-exceptionalist—that is, it is not simply an argument against American exceptionalism. Rather, it is an argument affirming exceptionalism’s inverse: an ideology that argues that America either has always been, or has become, a unique force for ill in the world.Counter-exceptionalism has crept into our public spaces en masse—and it is a force that threatens the political and cultural integrity both of the country as a whole and, in the more immediate term, of the ideological battles of those engaged in an earnest debate about how to better it. A left that cannot conceive of an America that has even the potential to be a force for good now struggles to make a positive argument for that good and concedes the grounds of hope and reconciliation to the exceptionalist right. The counter-exceptionalist right, meanwhile, has grown convinced of American decadence and decline—it believes that the United States has become a sort of Sodom, and in that conviction has become increasingly hostile to democracy and amenable to violence as a legitimate political mechanism.In the first part of the finale on Monday, Clayton second-guessed everything and broke down in tears as he mourned Susie’s departure. For some reason, this inspired him to be “transparent” with Rachel and Gabby, who were waiting for him at the rose ceremony, since he was supposed to be narrowing the final three down to the final two. In what host Jesse Palmer excitedly called the “rose ceremony from hell,” Clayton informed Rachel and Gabby that Susie left, and it had “shattered” him: “I was in love with her. … I am in love with both of you. And I also was intimate with both of you.” He admitted he had no idea whom to choose, and soon, the only sounds that could be heard were those of both Rachel and Gabby sobbing as they ran off in separate directions.Somehow (a producer’s encouragement?), Clayton was able to cajole Rachel and Gabby to stick around and even meet his family, who had traveled to Iceland to meet his final two. Everyone pretended not to be miserable, especially Clayton, though afterward he did the worst thing: After putting everyone through that forced happiness, he realized the person he really loved was Susie.During one recent news bulletin on BBC Radio 4, the correspondent referred to “Putin’s baseless claim that the Ukrainian state supports Nazis”. This is, itself, disinformation: it is an observable fact, which the BBC itself has previously reported on accurately and well, that the Ukrainian state has, since 2014, provided funding, weapons and other forms of support to extreme Right-wing militias, including neo-Nazi ones. This is not a new or controversial observation. Back in 2019, I spent time in Ukraine interviewing senior figures in the constellation of state-backed extreme Right-wing groups for Harper’s magazine; they were all quite open about their ideology and plans for the future. Indeed, some of the best coverage of Ukraine’s extreme Right-wing groups has come from the open-source intelligence outlet Bellingcat, which is not known for a favourable attitude towards Russian propaganda. Bellingcat’s excellent reporting of this under-discussed topic over the past few years has largely focused on the Azov movement, Ukraine’s most powerful extreme Right-wing group, and the one most favoured by the state’s largesse. A New Zealand couple who believed they had dug up the world’s largest potato in the garden of their small farm near Hamilton have had their dreams turned to mash after Guinness wrote to say that scientific testing had found it wasn’t, in fact, a potato after all. Colin Craig-Brown, who first hit the tuber with a hoe last August when gardening with his wife, Donna, said it sure looked and tasted like a potato. Mind you, he added, he’s never tasted a gourd tuber.Truly nothing better than Brooklyn barbecue… where else can you get all this for $59? pic.twitter.com/hffqHXEPwuRequired Reading is published every Thursday afternoon, and it is comprised of a short list of art-related links to long-form articles, videos, blog posts, or photo essays worth a second look.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Yesterday, airstrikes hit a theater sheltering hundreds of displaced families in the besieged city of Mariupol, the latest in a concerning number of recent “indiscriminate attacks” flagged by the United Nations as possible war crimes.Ukrainians are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, and while global aid organizations ramp up their important work, the arts community is doing its part to support them, raising funds and awareness. Some initiatives are already proving successful: Polish artist Karol Radziszewski’s print of renowned Ukrainian poet and feminist pioneer Lesya Ukrainka, illustrated above, was sold out in less than three days and helped raise over $11,000 for relief efforts. Below is a selection of ongoing art fundraisers, from online print sales to an in-person concert in New York City. All the organizers have said they will donate 100% of the proceeds to verified entities helping to alleviate the suffering caused by Russia’s senseless war. Four Ukraine-based art organizations — the Museum of Contemporary Art NGO (MOCA), Zaborona, the Naked Room, and Mystetskyi Arsenal — launched the Ukrainian Emergency Art Fund (UEAF) to assist the nation’s art community impacted by the war. The fund, administered by MOCA, offers one-time financial aid or stipends for up to three months for cultural workers from different sectors, from independent curators to researchers and writers. Donations can be made directly on the fund’s website, which also provides a Google Docs form for those in danger to request help.“We immediately felt that this was not just an unexpected tyranny move from Putin, but actually a carefully planned imperialistic ambition of Russia to neo-colonise Ukraine in full spectrum: territory, soil, people and culture,” Ilya Zabolotnyi, CEO and co-founder of UEAF, told Hyperallergic. “That’s when we understood that even during this war it is our task is to ensure the continuity and development of the Ukrainian cultural process during the war, so that the voice of cultural actors of Ukraine remains free, alive and strong.”Artists at Risk (AR), a nonprofit founded by Marita Muukkonen and Ivor Stodolsky in 2013 to protect cultural workers escaping persecution and war, said it has received hundreds of applications from Ukrainian artists and others seeking relocation in recent weeks. The organization is raising funds for emergency resources, travel aid, and shelter through its Solidarity Prints fundraiser, featuring works by 70 artists all priced at €200 (~$222). The sale includes an untitled inkjet print by Rirkrit Tiravanija, whose newsprint collages invite a more profound reflection on current events. In this particular print, the artist overlaid the New York Times’s surreal front page on February 24, the day of the Russian invasion, with a message of hope: “Shine Light Into Dark Places.” Other artists in AR’s sale include Nan Goldin, Isaac Julien, Sanya Kantarovsky, and Amy Sillman.This sensual and humorous painting by Brooklyn-based artist Jay Miriam is included in a fundraising sale for Ukraine organized by Her Clique, a group that elevates the work of women artists and supports like-minded nonprofits. Miriam is joined by Katharine Bradford, Deborah Kass, Marilyn Minter, Laurie Simmons, Cindy Sherman and other artists who donated work to help Voices of Children, a Ukrainian organization providing psychological support to the youngest victims of war. As the Russian invasion continues, Voices of Children is also aiding in evacuation efforts. New works will be added on Her Clique’s website every few days throughout the month of March, coinciding with Women’s Month worldwide.The Brooklyn artist-run center Ortega y Gasset (OyG) will be auctioning one artwork per day on its Instagram account through March 25 with all proceeds benefiting the Ukrainian human rights organization Razom and the UN World Food Programme. The works were donated by artists currently included in OyG’s Surface Tension exhibition and by the center’s own directors. Bidding for each work will start at $100 and last 24 hours, with all bids recorded in the comments section of each artwork’s Instagram post.Through mid-April, Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood is running a fundraising sale featuring many of the artists in its program, including Sandra Cinto, Sabine Hornig, Tomás Saraceno, and Sarah Sze. All proceeds will be evenly distributed between the International Committee of the Red Cross; the Fundacja Ocalenie, which is helping Ukrainian refugees who arrive in Poland; and Voices of Children. According to a gallery spokesperson, the sale has raised over $400,000 so far.This Friday, March 18, over 50 musicians, dancers, and poets will perform in a five-hour concert to benefit Doctors Without Borders in Ukraine at the Clemente Flamboyán Theater in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. The event is organized by the Clemente Soto Cultural Center and two sound and music nonprofits, Arts for Art and Deep Tones for Peace. The lineup includes Frank the London Brass Band and a string ensemble led by violinist Jason Kao Hwang. William Parker, hailed as “the most consistently brilliant free jazz bassist of all time,” will close the event with a full ensemble. Both virtual and in-person tickets are available, with a suggested donation of $25.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Excavation work is taking place ahead of the reconstruction of the church’s spire after a 2019 fire threatened to engulf the cathedral whole. The discoveries were made right beneath the intersection of the church’s transept and its main body.Bachelot specified in her statement that the remains were found in “remarkable scientific quality.” Archaeologists speculate that the coffin — which visibly appears to have been dented by the weight of centuries of compression by earth and stones — contains the remains of an important church dignitary. A miniature endoscopic camera was used to peer inside the sarcophagus, which allowed researchers to detect pieces of fabric, hair, and a pile of leaves resting on the head of the deceased — a typical funerary practice for religious figures. Several tombs and a leaden sarcophagus likely dating from the 14th century have been uncovered by archaeologists at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris as work continues on the building’s reconstruction after its devastating 2019 fire. https://t.co/KsAsyeVCs5 pic.twitter.com/eny4JIZnJr“The fact that these plant elements are still inside means the body is in a very good state of conservation,” Christophe Besnier, lead archaeologist on the team, told the Guardian. In addition to the tombs and coffin, archaeologists have also identified parts of painted sculptures such as pieces from an original 13th-century rood screen, a decorative partition between the altar and the rest of the nave that is a common feature of late medieval church architecture. Agence France-Presse reported in a visit to the site of the excavation that archaeologists could be seen removing a bust of a bearded man and “sculpted vegetables” from the earth. Also uncovered in the excavation was a subterranean heating system serviced by brick pipes dating from the 19th century.The conclusion of the excavation project, set for March 25, heralds the resumption of reconstruction work on the spire, which is to be completed in 2024, in time for the Summer Olympics in Paris. It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

The decision may be seen as controversial to some museum workers who had pushed management to end a previous contract with the NYPD in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020. The museum also hired details from a private security company, according to several people who attended the meeting.MoMA has not returned Hyperallergic’s repeated requests for comment.The enhanced security measures come after a former museum member identified as 60-year-old Gary Cabana attacked and wounded two front desk employees at the museum’s Film Center entrance on March 12. Security footage showed the suspect leaping over the reception desk and stabbing the workers — a man and a woman, both aged 24 — multiple times in the back, collarbone, and neck. Bellevue Hospital in Midtown Manhattan said both workers were in stable condition and would recover from their injuries.MOMA ATTACK: Police say they&apos;re looking for 60-year-old Gary Cabana for yesterday&apos;s brutal attack inside the Museum of Modern Art. They say both 24-year-old victims, a woman and a man, are now in stable condition. But this is new video they released of the stabbing. pic.twitter.com/bS5eHo54LOAfter three days on the run, Cabana was apprehended at a bus station in Philadelphia. According to John Miller, NYPD’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, the suspect was “upset” that he was denied entry to the museum after his membership was revoked due to two past incidents “involving disorderly conduct.” Friends and acquaintances of Cabana said that his mental health has deteriorated since he lost his job as a Broadway usher during the pandemic. In a now-removed post on Facebook, he alluded to living with a bipolar disorder.MoMA workers who spoke with Hyperallergic reported an atmosphere of fear and trepidation at the museum in the aftermath of the attack. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because employees were asked by leadership not to give interviews to the press.“We’re shocked at what happened, but we’re not entirely surprised,” said one worker who regularly interfaces with visitors. “We constantly deal with members who throw tantrums, especially at the film department.”The worker said that colleagues have previously expressed safety concerns about the film reception desk, saying it leads to a “cul-de-sac” and could leave workers trapped in the event of an attack. This scenario became a terrifying reality last week, as security footage showed the assaulted workers trapped behind the enclosed, curving desk. The museum has not responded to this allegation; the desk was relocated further inside the building after the attack.Workers at MoMA’s Visitor Engagement department (or Visitor Services) count among the museum’s most vulnerable, lowest-paid employees. The starting annual salary for a full-time Guest Assistant at MoMA is $36,131. After a year, a worker in the department becomes a Guest Specialist at $41,570. Salaries include benefits and tend to rise over the years based on seniority, largely thanks to years of contract negotiations between the museum and UAW Local 2110, the union representing MoMA workers and colleagues at other New York museums.“Wages are higher at MoMA because we’ve been unionized for longer,” said Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110, in an email to Hyperallergic. “Rates at museums that are non-union or have just unionized are much lower. At the Guggenheim and Whitney, for example, people start at $17-$18 an hour, are usually part-time, and don’t have health benefits.”Rosenstein added that the union is currently talking to workers at MoMA about what security measures they would like to see in light of the attack. “It’s been very traumatic, especially for those who work in Visitor Services and Membership,” she said. It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Dubai-based interdisciplinary artists Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh, and Hesam Rahmanian will have the opportunity to develop their practice in a context that is rich with artistic and cultural significance and ongoing contemporary relevance.Over the past few decades, Ramin, Rokni, and Hesam have shared a life philosophy that has allowed for mutual creation, during which their individual practices interact with their collaborative ones and which is informed by the understanding and technical skills of other people. From the dialogues they build among themselves and with other artists, friends, and collaborators, these artists have established a personal language that enables them to present different layers of content and texture in their work.Origins of the PrizeBlack Mountain College (BMC) was a uniquely global college, with ideas and ideals grounded in worldviews that extend beyond the Western canon. In the same way, the legacy of the college has taken root across the globe, evolving and expanding to encompass disparate identities and forms of expression. Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center (BMCM+AC) is dedicated to preserving the history of BMC as well as facilitating new work through collaboration with contemporary artists. As they advance this mission they look to a blueprint set forth by BMC that valued the greater good, experimentation, and accountability.Funded by cultural pollinators Hedy Fischer and Randy Shull, the BMC Prize will allow BMCM+AC to continue on this path by building relationships and creating an impact with intention by supporting the creation of new work by the most innovative artists working within the BMC tradition today. The BMC Prize reflects the spirit of Black Mountain College as a place conducive to experimentation, where global social movements, communitarian efforts, and process-based practice flourished.For more information, visit blackmountaincollege.org.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Art.

According to the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA), the juried Native American art fair features approximately 1,000 Indigenous artists from over 200 federally recognized tribes selling works ranging from pottery and textiles to jewelry and paintings.It’s a far cry from its beginnings 100 years ago, when the market’s organizers didn’t allow participating Native American artisans to be seen by the buying public. Today, the country’s largest Native American public event, which features contemporary and traditional Indigenous art from the United States and Canada, is organized and produced by Kim Peone (Colville Confederated Tribes/Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians), who’s supported by a staff of mostly Native American women. Throughout its history, the market has often responded to the country’s changing sociopolitical climate and the evolving creative output of Indigenous artists.“It originally came from a preservation perspective of cultures and now it’s evolved into this place of sustaining and supporting living cultures,” says Peone, who became the executive director of SWAIA, the nonprofit that helms the market, in 2020.The market’s debut in 1922, a smaller affair presented under the mouthful title of The Southwest Indian Fair and Industrial Arts and Crafts Exhibition, was held indoors rather than the bustling Santa Fe Plaza. The event, which included Navajo rugs and Plains Indians beadwork and basketry, focused on ceramics in an effort to revive Pueblo pottery making, according to Cathy Notarnicola, curator of Southwest history at the New Mexico History Museum. (The Santa Fe cultural institution, in partnership with SWAIA, is set to open the Tradition and Innovation exhibition on August 7, 2022 that chronicles the history of the market; it’s scheduled to remain on view through August 2023.)Notarnicola adds that the event borrowed influences from the Panama–California Exposition, a World’s Fair-style shindig that took place in 1915. Edgar Lee Hewett, an archeologist and director of the Museum of New Mexico, attended the San Diego fair and later co-founded what would become Indian Market with Kenneth Chapman.The market attempted to capitalize on New Mexico’s burgeoning tourist industry — tourism remains one of the state’s largest money-making enterprises — that brought visitors to the Land of Enchantment via the Santa Fe Railway, Notarnicola explains. It was also in response to the various failed US government policies — including removal, reservation, and assimilation — that attempted to wipe out Indian Country.“It was like salvage ethnography in an attempt to try to save what was left of Indian cultures after all the devastating policies,” says Notarnicola.“The first market came at it from an anthropological perspective, thinking that they were going to preserve Indian arts because we were on the brink of extinction,” adds Peone.Native artisans weren’t allowed to sell their works in-person at the market until 1931, which predated the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, a federal government policy that attempted to reverse the damages of cultural assimilation.The post-World War II federal Indian policy of termination and relocation — the US government ditched its relationships with tribes so that Native people could be “civilized” into mainstream White society, often in the big cities — did a number on Indian Market.The cultural event bounced back in the 1960s with the beginning of the self-determination era and the 1962 establishment of the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA). Notarnicola says IAIA, founded by Lloyd Kiva New (Cherokee) and George Boyce, is often credited for the inception of contemporary Native art. Fritz Scholder (La Jolla Band of Luiseño Indians) and Allan Houser (Chiricahua Apache) taught at the Santa Fe school; alumni include current US poet laureate Joy Harjo (Muscogee/Creek), sculptor, ceramicist, Indigenous food activist, and gallerist Roxanne Swentzell (Santa Clara Pueblo), and the late painter and printmaker T.C. Cannon (Kiowa/Caddo).“Another major shift occurred with regards to the mission of the market, which, in its origination, preserved traditional designs and technologies of the past,” says Peone. “Today, the market honors and encourages innovation in its works of Native artists.”In the 1970s, the market became a predominantly Native American-represented organization, according to Jamie Schulze (Northern Cheyenne), SWAIA director of operations, and has steadily grown. Today, the annual summer event attracts upwards of 150,000 visitors, who can talk with and purchase work from Native artists throughout approximately 17 city blocks in and around the historic Santa Fe Plaza.“There’s a camaraderie that happens with artists and collectors where every year they get to see each other again and catch up on what’s happened in the past year,” says Notarnicola, who adds that she’s seen the children of artists and collectors grow up together at the market over the last 30 years.Moving forward, Peone says Santa Fe Indian Market, which also produces a yearly winter market, will continue adapting to the contemporary moment while fostering personal and cultural sustainability for Native artists.“We are definitely pivoting,” she says. “We really want to get away from an organization that only concentrates on two markets. How that comes about really comes from the perspective of partnerships and how we want to not only be a part of this community, but contribute to this community 365 days out of the year.”Editor’s Note, 03/18/22, 10:50am EDT: An earlier version of this article mistakenly identified the year Native artisans were allowed to sell work in person at the market as 1933.

All of them were done on mottled grounds in which the weave of the canvas was visible. The grounds were mossy green, dark brown, or earth red — colors we are apt to associate with nature. It is an association that Ryman would most likely have accepted, even as he would also have emphasized, in that soft-spoken demeanor he had, that nature was never a subject he pursued. These modestly scaled paintings — his last body of work before his death in 2019 — constitute the exhibition Robert Ryman: The Last Paintings at David Zwirner (February 10–March 26, 2022), his first with the gallery, which now represents his estate. It is both unfortunate and understandable that Ryman became known during his lifetime as an abstract artist who used only white paint, because “white” is a generalizing term that suppresses all the nuances that one encounters in his work. In each of the exhibition’s eight paintings, the ground is never uniformly one color, as the density of the tone changes. The tonal change becomes evident when the viewer stands close to the painting, which is something that Ryman must have wanted, because, with at least one work, one side is a darker hue than the painting’s surface, suggesting that he added another brushstroke of thin color. These differences and shifts in the ground are picked up in the topography of brushstrokes he built up on the modulated surface, always leaving the painting’s four edges visible. While the visceral shape always fits within the support’s surface, its placement and relationship to the painting’s physical edges vary, as do the brushstrokes. In “Untitled” (2010, 18 by 18 inches, oil on stretched cotton canvas), which was done on an earth-red ground — a color that also calls up Greek red-figure pottery — the shape comes right up to the edge on the painting’s ride side, while Ryman left more space between the paint and the edge of the canvas on the left and along the top and bottom. In this painting, Ryman began with short gray-green brushstrokes, some of which he covered over as he added more paint. After this first layer, he added celadon strokes. By the time he added the thicker white brushstrokes (tinged with ochre yellow), he had already laid down two layers of paint. The white paint sits within the shape made by the first two layers, but Ryman did not try to cover all evidence of what preceded this final layer. The paint’s thickness results in a rough, uneven surface in which the celadon strokes peek through, as do the gray-green strokes that extend beyond the white along the top left and side edges. While these turned out to be Ryman’s last paintings, they do not feel that way — he did not know that he would have an accident and be unable to paint again. There is a joy to these paintings, as well as a playfulness, all arising from the artist’s sensitivity to tone, contrast, placement, and natural light, which is how he would have wanted them to be seen. I remember Ryman suggesting that I go to one of his shows in the late afternoon, when the paintings would be illuminated by the darkening sky filtering in through the skylight. He wanted his work to be seen without being enhanced by artificial light. Ryman’s preoccupation with the relationship between the painting and natural light brings me back to my initial suggestion that nature was key to his work. His belief in paintings as flat, square objects placed against the wall and seen in natural light, as things in the world, is the foundation upon which he developed his practice. That understanding of painting became the circumference within which he worked and where he found immense freedom and joy. While art historians and critics have predominantly focused on what Ryman absorbed from Mark Rothko — a consciousness of the painting’s physical edge and the placement of the shape within — and from the cluster of creamy vertical and horizontal strokes in Philip Guston’s paintings from the early 1950s, it seems to me that he also drew on other inspirations that might be considered unfashionable, which is why they are seldom if ever mentioned. Two of the artists that I am thinking about are Edwin Dickinson and Bradley Walker Tomlin, whose works were in the house Ryman and his wife, the artist Merrill Wagner, lived in for many years. Doesn’t the green that Tomlin used in “Number 9: In Praise of Gertrude Stein” (1950) remind you of some of the greens one finds in Ryman’s paintings? (Isn’t it worth remembering that Guston dedicated a painting to Tomlin and readily admitted that he was an inspiration?) Ryman, who worked as a guard in the Museum of Modern Art for seven years, was an autodidact. He educated himself in the museum and never lost his initial curiosity about paint, materials, and the hardware that went into a painting. For him it was all a joy, inflected with a sense of humor. Nothing about painting was mundane. He knew everything he used had its own identity and he was respectful of that, down to the color of a nail and the shape of its head. The pleasure he took in seeing and sensing the world of things so closely is what viewers who are open to his work will take away. Just as Ryman considered the density and viscosity of paint, whether it was lead or titanium white (and how much red, blue, or yellow ochre it contained), different surfaces (aluminum, Tyvek, canvas, and linen), where to start and stop, and how to affix it to the wall, and was always conscious of every choice he made, always responsible for it, he invites viewers to do the same. We do not just look at a Ryman painting; we see ourselves looking at it, walking around it, scrutinizing the relationship of the painting’s sides to the surface. He was not interested in having a painting reveal itself all at once, and in that regard he stood apart from many of his contemporaries In her groundbreaking book, Robert Ryman: Used Paint (2009) Suzanne P. Hudson cites the artist’s statement about his beginnings: I thought I would see what would happen. I wanted to see what the paint would do, how the brushes would work. This was the first step. I just played around. I had nothing really in mind to paint. I was just finding out how the paint worked, colors, thick and thin, the brushes, the surfaces. While Hudson focuses primarily on what Ryman learned by working in the Museum of Modern Art, where he took an art-education class on experimental painting in 1953 (although he claimed to have no detailed memories of what he learned in it), it should also be stressed that his approach to painting was influenced by his desire to be jazz saxophonist and his study with the pianist Lennie Tristano. When he abandoned that dream and focused on painting he remained true to something bebop musicians embraced: an openness to experiment and to discovering how the instrument worked. His approach to painting reminds me of Rahsaan Roland Kirk’s experiments with all different kinds of saxophones (he was known to wear three around his neck when he played a concert). Disinterested in the idea of the masterpiece, Ryman defined a very different trajectory than that of his peers.  Robert Ryman: The Last Paintings continues at David Zwirner (34 East 69th Street, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through March 26.

The two brothers first made a big splash in the 1990s, when they fabricated a gruesome, three-dimensional version of an etching by Goya from a series called The Disasters of War. This assemblage of lopped and mutilated, mannequin-like human limbs hanging from a tree was shown in an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1997 called Sensation. It was a nasty piece of work. It likely made you wince because it seemed to lack compassion or human feeling of any kind. It was also entirely characteristic. The brothers seemed to revel in the business of provoking and outraging the world. They wanted to be seen as bruisers, Bad Boys, agents provocateurs. They bristled with a kind of sneery arrogance. I first met them at their studio in London’s Old Kent Road in the autumn of 1998. Jake was the spokesman, the reader, the intellectual, the pushy one; Dinos tended to hang back. Our conversation rapidly declined into an unpleasant argument. Jake heaped mockery and derision on my shoulders. He told me that I knew nothing about art at all. He was even kind enough to give me a reading list. I told him that I honestly thought the 75-page catalogue essay he had written to accompany a show in New York was one of the most pretentious pieces of crap I had ever read, an ill-digested mash-up from bits of Heidegger, Sartre, and others, worthy of a teenager. Jake, I felt, was loving every minute of this bit of verbal brawling. This is how he wanted to engage with art critics and journalists. It would give him notoriety, enemies. And it did. It did. Their eye-catching acts of provocation continued. They reveled in it. They bought a collection of utterly banal paintings by Adolf Hitler, and painted over parts of them in silly and clownish ways. Once again, the action felt attention seeking. What they had done could be taken exception to in a variety of ways. Tastelessness, for example. Who in their right mind would wish to buy and then exhibit — and thereby associate themselves with — bad paintings by a monster called Hitler? And then daub over them? In 2003, they were shortlisted for the Turner Prize, and they put on a considered show of public outrage when they failed to win. Grayson Perry, who became more than their equal at the art of showmanship and look-at-me-ism, beat them to it. It was in that exhibition that they returned once again to Goya, who has proven to be an abiding obsession of theirs. This time they painted over an entire suite of those same etchings referred to above, adding clownish heads and other trivializing details of buffoonish defacement. Oh horror! How the art world howled! All very good for the Chapmans’ publicity machine.And now we are all a quarter of a century older and wiser, and I am talking to Jake Chapman once again — the call is mediated by Yuval Etgar, the young Israeli curator who conceived this exhibition with him — over the telephone from his home in the Cotswolds, which is as far away in mood from the Old Kent Road as you could possibly conceive. Much else has changed. He and his brother have suffered a divorce. They are no longer quite that cheeky twosome, artistic bomb-tossers of the 1990s. Dinos now lives and works as a solo artist in Los Angeles. The Cotswolds, where his brother Jake has his home, is generally depicted as a snapshot of a timeless, sweet-faced rural idyll of the England that once used to be. “What’s happened then?” I ask Jake. Was it a painless divorce? We were never joined at the hip, Jake tells me. It wasn’t a symbiotic relationship. He always read a lot, whereas Dinos didn’t. Is he still a Bad Boy? I wonder. He partly answers the question for me without my even having to ask. It’s quite hard, he tells me, going from being a YBA to an OAP …The new show is, nevertheless, a thoroughgoing and unmistakably Chapman endeavor. Having said that, it is also less shrill and combative than in the past, and perhaps more calmly thought-provoking. Yet it still manages to include the odd whiff of quite deliberate — and perhaps even tasteless, if not downright unpleasant — provocation. The press materials tell us that the show — which is called Bad Manners — is an exploration of “non-consensual” collaborations between artists from about the middle of the 19th century to the present day. You cannot help but linger over that compound adjective, “non-consensual,” and quietly reflect upon the fact that it is most often used in the context of sexual assault. So the ante is being raised — as usual.So what exactly do we have in this gallery today? We have a number of works that could be described as cannibalistic: an artist has acquired a work by another artist and done something with it and to it — drawn on it, added to it, turned it into a part of something quite different from what it was in the first place, and all without the permission of its creator. Once this happens, confusion sets in: who is now the creator of this work? Is there anger and dismay too? Not necessarily from the original creator because he or she may be dead, and therefore beyond the reach of caring at all. One of the most interesting examples of cannibalistic collaboration in this show is what looks like a smallish wooden coffee table raised up on a low plinth. In many respects it looks thoroughly unremarkable. And yet something rather odd has happened to its surface. In fact, set into that surface is an abstract painting by Gerhard Richter. Who had the barefaced cheek to turn a painting by Richter into the surface of something as banal and unremarkable as a coffee table on which you might easily and unthinkingly plonk down a cup of coffee? Martin Kippenberger did it, one of the postwar German bad boys — they do come in many different nationalities. And did Richter complain? I ask Yuval Etgar. Not as far as he knows. He probably thought it was quite a good joke. Artists generally don’t complain when this sort of thing happens. They leave that to the collectors, the dealers, the advertising men.  Bad Manners: On the Creative Potentials of Modifying Other Artists’ Work continues at Luxembourg + Co.

In Raychel Carrión’s monochrome graphite drawing “Romper” (2020) — “to break” — rows of empty bus seats emerge from a thick, textured darkness akin to smog. In the foreground, the distinct shape of a police baton can be discerned amid the sinuous curves of metal railings, chain-like patterns, and strap handles that resemble hooks — mundane elements made sinister.“On the 27th of January, in front of Havana’s Ministry of Culture, agents of Cuban state police beat approximately 20 activists, artists, and reporters who were reading poetry,” reads a wall label for the work now on view at Montserrat Gallery in Manhattan, written in Spanish. “That day it was shown that in Cuba, what is called ‘culture’ is just another arm of power and repression.” An audio clip accompanying the piece amplifies the screams heard as officers apprehended participants of the pacific homage to Cuban author and journalist José Martí, shoving them onto the bus Carrión so uncannily captured.Some of the artists included in Umbral, conceived by Havana-based curators Claudia Genlui and Anamely Ramos, were present that dark day in Havana, and are often on the frontlines of similar incidents so frequent in Cuba that they have become almost commonplace. In this exhibition of works by Cuban artists, activists, and members of the dissident San Isidro Movement, several names are familiar for their recurrence in headlines decrying state repression of free speech and creative freedom. One of Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara’s symbolic Door paintings hangs next to a blue hard hat worn by the artist as part of a performance piece during the month of February 2020, after three children died when a building collapsed in Old Havana the previous year. Alcántara was detained several times for wearing the helmet in public, a wall text says. And he remains in a maximum-security prison in Havana at the time of this writing, behind bars for the last eight months as one of hundreds arrested during historic anti-government protests on the island last year. When Umbral opened on March 5, Genlui, his partner, had not heard from Alcántara in weeks and knew his health was rapidly declining after he declared a hunger strike in January; it was not his first. Last year’s peaceful demonstrations in Cuba, which found echoes in solidarity protests around the world, were largely prompted by longstanding food and medicine shortages and poverty exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two prints by Aryam Rodriguez feature bottles of rum the Cuban government handed out to households last December, a strategy to deflect attention from these scarcities, as a wall text explains. The rum was distilled using sugar from the 2020-2021 Zafra harvest, dubbed the “worst in the last 120 years in Cuba” due to lack of fuel, machinery parts, and low yields.Ramos explains the resonance of the title Umbral, or “threshold,” as “the idea of remaining at the entrance of something, but at a distance.” “The fundamental thesis is that when you talk about Cuba, you have to enter a previous, introductory space, the Umbral, where certain notions that are difficult for the rest of the world to understand are explained through the voices of these artists who are in danger,” Ramos told Hyperallergic at the opening of the show. The term encompasses the specific dystopia of voicing dissent while living on the island as well as the tension of existing as a Cuban citizen anywhere in the world, as the government maintains discretionary power to deny entry into or exit out of the country. Ramos currently finds herself currently inhabiting this “liminal space,” she adds: When she attempted to return to Havana from the United States last month, gate agents prevented her from boarding the flight.“Umbral was created from a place of permeability,” Ramos said. “It is resistance, it’s an attempt to reflect on what a frontier is, where Cuba begins and where it ends, and what it means to be safe in Cuba today.”Artist Camila Lobón, a Camagüey native whose works on view include illustrations designed for various civic actions on the island, recently completed a residency in Miami and plans on returning to Cuba. “The generation I identify with has a deep consciousness around this question of naturalizing the fact of returning, of entering and leaving and coming back, of regaining our ownership over the territory,” Lobón told Hyperallergic. “In my case, I don’t think about the concept of country or nationalism — it’s my home, it’s where the people I love are, and for that reason, I have the right to be there,” she said.In their subtle elegance, Lobón’s drawings are tacitly subversive. One of them depicts three stages in the metamorphosis of a butterfly labeled with the words “resistance, contempt, and disobedience,” the charges on which rapper Maykel Osorbo was arrested in May 2021. Another, a drawing of José Martí modeled after Cuban modernist Jorge Arche’s iconic portrait of the writer, was made for a “poetic pilgrimage” calling for the liberation of rapper Denis Solis in 2020. “I have two homelands: Cuba and the night,” it reads, citing Martí’s poem. “Or are they one?”“Carolina [Barrero], a historian and activist, had the idea of making these as posters and giving them away. We never got to do that, because police intervened in her home, found the prints, and accused her of ‘clandestine printing,’” Lobón said. “Something as simple as the image of Martí, because of the gesture it implied about autonomy over an image, over an idea, is seen as an act of rebellion in Cuba.” Alexis Romay, a Cuban writer and teacher who attended the opening of Umbral, left the island in 1999. When asked if he plans on returning, he quotes Heraclitus: “No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.”“I resist the hyphen: I don’t call myself ‘Cuban-American.’ I am profoundly Cuban,” Romay told Hyperallergic. “But like many other Cubans, I told myself that I cannot return to that Cuba. I can’t return to a place from which I escaped.”“What they are doing — Anamely, Camila, Claudia — is asserting the idea that this country is ours,” he continued. “I don’t think I’ll ever step on Cuban soil again, but if I do, it’s because of them. They are returning to me a country that I had lost.”A screen plays the music video for “¿De qué me van a hablar?” (“What are they going to talk to me about?”) (2021) shot by Anyelo Troya and featuring Osorbo and Elexer Funk “El Funky,” which calls for freedom for Alcántara and members of the San Isidro Movement. Osorbo and El Funky are co-authors of “Patria y Vida,” which became a rallying cry for freedom during the peaceful protests of July 2021. When the video for that song began to “spread like wildfire” among Cubans, wrote curator Coco Fusco for Hyperallergic, the government launched a defamation campaign against it that included homophobic attacks. Osorbo is currently in prison and El Funky lives in exile in the US. Troya is in Havana with a yearlong order that restricts his mobility. In a small room in the back of the gallery, Indira Romero, a Cuban artist and performer, offers tarot readings with a deck of cards illustrated by many of the artists in the show. The High Priestess was designed by Lobón, a jovial portrait of Cuban salsa musician Celia Cruz mid-song against a background of papayas. Hamlet Lavastida, who was forced into exile last year after three months in prison in Cuba, drew number 15, the Devil: the unmistakable silhouette of Fidel Castro pointing a gun. “Our cry should not be in vain,” Genlui wrote in a statement for the exhibition. “Luis Manuel always said that art gives us the possibility of helping everyone understand. Today, he and Maykel assume that cry in the form of extreme sacrifice; today, through curation and art, we are by their sides, we transit that threshold and we invite the world to understand us.”It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Encompassing work by 12 women photographers that spans the course of the 20th century, this impressive exhibition showcases these artists’ creative ingenuity and their raw technical skill. The exhibition title cleverly inverts Laura Mulvey’s concept of “the male gaze” — which, according to Mulvey’s well-known essay, objectifies and fetishizes its female subjects — while rightly acknowledging that its artists’ perspectives are not universal; it is a vision, not the vision. A Female Gaze includes a wide range of street photography, not all of which was taken at street level. Several works by Ruth Orkin were taken looking down from the artist’s apartment window, giving the scenes an angled, almost Constructivist appearance. “Man in Rain”(1952) is one such image, which masterfully captures individual raindrops — no easy feat, even with today’s digital technology. Berenice Abbott’s show-stopping aerial photograph “Night View, New York”(1932) is one of those works that now looks cliché because of the decades of photographers who have tried to imitate it. The level of detail in the gargantuan gelatin silver print is startling; despite the photograph’s 15-minute exposure time, one can still make out the rooms behind each illuminated window.Many of the women in A Female Gaze were members of the Photo League, a New York cooperative of socially conscious photographers that was active from 1936 until 1951, when its leftist origins landed it on a Justice Department blacklist. The organization championed work that was both aesthetically composed and socially significant; for example, Helen Levitt, one of the better-known female photographers associated with the group, documented children on the on the streets of New York and the chalk drawings they left behind. One of the works from this series, “N.Y.” (c. 1942), depicts a delightfully youthful chalk portrait of a girl with a sly smile. Positioned so that only the plane of the sidewalk is in view, the photograph itself becomes a kind of abstract drawing, recalling Brassaï’s Graffiti photo series of the 1930s. Women like Levitt made up almost a third of the League’s membership, serving significant roles within the organization at a time when women were rarely allowed such agency.Whether these women of the Photo League were really “encouraged equally alongside their male counterparts” as the press release claims is up for debate; as Catherine Evans writes in The Radical Camera: New York’s Photo League 1936-1951, the League “encouraged women but did not entirely support them.” Photo League editors — just like their gallery and institutional counterparts — favored work by male photographers, leaving many of the group’s female members to return to the domestic roles that society expected of them. Today, much of their work has been lost.Hopefully, A Female Gaze signals a new direction for Howard Greenberg Gallery’s program, which has skewed disproportionately white and male. While the art world has become increasingly conscious of gender and racial inequity in recent years — and the gallery itself is predominantly staffed by women — its program has in fact become less equal along gender lines over the past decade. From 2013 to 2015, its website indicates that 26 percent of its solo exhibitions were of female artists; from 2016-2018, as the MeToo movement gained traction, this figure dropped to 18 percent. Since 2018, solo presentations by female artists now stand at a dismal 7 percent. Of the 66 artists that Howard Greenberg lists as representing on its primary roster, 10 of them are women. (Only two Black artists are included in this list: Gordon Parks and James Van Der Zee.)From its inception, Howard Greenberg Gallery has championed a socially conscious approach to photography similar to that of the Photo League; a pioneer in the art market, the gallery fought for photojournalism and street photography’s place in the canon. Its program, however, hasn’t always matched its ethos. As one of New York City’s leading photo galleries—particularly as one that describes its collection as “a living history of photography”—it should strive to represent an accurate, more complete view of that history. As Mary Ellen Mark once said, “nothing is more interesting than reality.”A Female Gaze: Seven Decades of Women Street Photographers continues at Howard Greenberg Gallery (41 East 57th Street, Suite 801, Midtown, Manhattan) through April 2.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

The 2022 iteration includes several timely works about Ukrainian/post-Soviet history, a pre-COVID meditation on isolation from Poland, a survey of men who live in abandoned missile launch silos, and much more. One of the more exciting picks is As Mine Exactly, a virtual reality performance piece by filmmaker Charlie Shackleton. During the experience, a participant sits across from Shackleton in a room and straps on a VR headset. Shackleton then reads his lines aloud in the room as imagery from his youth plays on the participant’s screen, laying out the story of his mother’s experiences with epilepsy and how seeing her seizures as a boy impacted him. He not only narrates, but also “converses” with his mother, whose voice is heard through a speaker positioned behind the viewer. By actively mediating the participant’s interactions with this anecdote, Shackleton draws attention to the ways we already reframe and perform our pasts, both in how we personally process events and how we relate them to others. Hyperallergic sat down with Shackleton over Zoom to discuss the piece and the logistical and artistic headaches involved in making it. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and brevity.* * *Hyperallergic: Why was it important that you be a physically present part of this experience?Charlie Shackleton: I had qualms about telling this story on film to begin with, because it felt so personal, intimate, and sensitive. Some of the material and experience I let people in on, I was daunted by. I think when I had the idea of it becoming a one-on-one performance, that felt like it circumstantially matched what it represented to me to be sharing this story. However I did it, it would’ve felt like I was confiding in the audience, so why not stage it in such a way that I am literally doing that? And everything that would bring to the performance would heighten the themes of the story. It is so much about presence and absence, so to have me present with the viewer underlined that in a way nothing else really could.H: Especially since, even though you are physically present, there’s the distancing element of the audience member wearing the VR headset.CS: Yeah. It’s fascinating to watch people do it. You’re intensely close to someone in a way that you almost never are with a stranger. I’m staring at their face for half an hour, but they can’t see me back. They can hear me, how proximate I am to them, but it’s a weird kind of proximity that’s unlike anything else. I come out of it — and I think they come out of it — feeling both really close to the other person but also weirdly alienated from them. And again, that felt right for this. I can’t imagine doing another piece like this, because I don’t know what kinds of stories it would suit.H: How did you prepare to perform this way? What effect have the performances so far had on you?CS: I think I prepared in all the wrong ways. [laughs] I did have a long time to think about it, and I knew that it was going to be exhausting — emotionally, physically, even technically, having to be in command of the various components. All that turned out to be true, but in a different way than I ever could’ve imagined. I think what I didn’t really prepare myself for was how psychologically intense it is for a succession of different people go through something emotionally with you. And the reactions really varied. Sometimes it was easy to tell how someone was feeling, sometimes it was quite hard. But I think it left a psychic impact on me as well, just watching them receive it.H: Subjectivity is a recurring theme in your work.  CS: My short Personal Truth made me think about the layers of mediation in telling a personal story. Not only was my notionally conversational voiceover obviously scripted and had been reread so many times in recording it, but also what I was expressing as my unvarnished perspective was of course heavily filtered. It had been through many rounds of drafts in an attempt to make it satisfying, structurally and emotionally. I’d always had this slightly uneasy relationship with how I presented myself in my own work; it’s a strange semi-real, semi-unreal version. I knew that in telling a story that was so personal, I had to confront that within it. It would be dishonest to say that I can tell a story about this incredibly formative part of my life impartially or without artifice.H: How did you plot out what to put into the headset screen, and how to present it, edit it, arrange it, and more?CS: One of the things I like about that technology is that it feels experimental. You put the headset on and you can decide what you’re going to do inside it; it can be completely spontaneous and impulsive. I didn’t see that reflected in any of the broadly defined ‘film work’ being made for VR. It instead felt like everything was super polished. There’s a focus on immersion that leads people toward sanding off all the rough edges and making grand statements. I was interested in VR as a DIY tool, especially because the technology is still so ropy and breaks as often as it works. It’s only as useful as what it allows you to do, not for its own innate being. I wanted to make something that would evolve quickly and responsively as I was road-testing it. It’s never going to stop evolving as long as I’m performing it. It’s already changed quite a lot just over the course of a week of doing it.The material evolved in response to showing it to people. I had endless material, thousands of childhood photographs and videos and things I’d written, things my mom had written, any of which could’ve been included — and a lot of which was included, at one point or another. But when you get someone in a headset, it’s fascinating to see where their focus sharpens and where it doesn’t. I can see where they’re looking, what’s catching their attention and whether that aligns with my intention. Those moments are what I tried to build the piece around.Initially I did what I think 99% of people who first make work for VR do, which is shoot a load of 360-degree footage. But because my piece is a theatrical performance as much as it is a work of VR, I had two spaces I needed to orchestrate: the 360-degree canvas of the headset and the physical space I and the participant occupy. And often the two worked against each other. I found that if I started the piece and all I gave them to look at was an image I put directly in front of them, they would focus intensely forward on that spot, which was where I was in the room. That bond was intense, and something I could exploit to create the intimate relationship the piece relies on. But when I showed them a 360-degree video, that bond was instantly severed; they’d look around, look behind themselves. And as fun or immersive as it might’ve been, I never got back that focus. That led me to strip back how much of the virtual canvas I occupied, to maintain control of the audience member’s focus.Something that’s also interesting about VR is the void, which you don’t often get to see because most of the work is so visually populated. You don’t usually get to linger on the strange absence of a frame, but I think that’s intriguing. If I put something in someone’s peripheral vision in a space they had gotten used to being blank, you can see how radical it is for them to suddenly breach this imagined wall. That wouldn’t be the case if I had quickly filled in all the space and shown them a 360-degree vision of my childhood street.H: What technical and artistic changes have you made in this road-testing process?CS: Pacing is probably the biggest thing. What feels right when I’m rehearsing feels totally different in an actual atmosphere with a human being. The pauses are often much longer now than I ever imagined they would be, either because the person is reacting in some way that I need to leave space for, or just because something strikes me in the moment and it feels like it needs to breathe.I also need to reassure people as early as possible that they don’t have to perform. I really need to get that in the synopsis. If I was a viewer, I would be put off by the idea that it was immersive theater, where you have to play a role. I don’t want to only have a self-selecting audience of people who would be up for that kind of thing. It needs to be clear that it’s very low-key, low pressure, that the experience is ultimately being told a story by another human being.First Look 2022 runs March 16-20 at the Museum of the Moving Image (36-01 35 Avenue, Astoria, Queens).It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Ukraine has got you covered, with a new stamp that commemorates Ukrainian soldier Roman Gribov’s reply to a Russian warship that asked his force on Snake Island to surrender: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself!”Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzheppar, announced the stamp in a tweet earlier this week. The stamp’s design, featuring a panoramic view of a Ukrainian soldier giving an approaching Russian warship the middle finger, was created by Ukrainian artist Boris Groh and submitted to a public contest by the Ukrainian Postal Service (Ukrposhta). The postage stamp named &quot;Russian warship, go f**k yourself!&quot; will appear in🇺🇦.  The sketch by artist Boris Groh received the most votes and will soon be published by Ukraine&apos;s state postal company.🇺🇦✌️#StandWithUkraine#StopRussianAgression pic.twitter.com/ByYAzw2tYqGroh’s entry was the winner through social media upvotes, beating out a field of four finalists that included a graphic sinking Russian warship with the included text dripping blood; a subtle Snake Island carved out against a Ukrainian yellow ocean and blue sky telling a huge Russian warship to fuck itself; and one that rendered the small troop of soldiers stationed on the island on a little bit of land, buoyed by their iconic battle cry. Groh proved that a picture is worth a thousand words, as the only entry to elide the phrase entirely, replacing it with a single, eloquent gesture.The stamp is only the latest in what is being considered a masterful public image campaign on the part of Ukraine, encouraging national fortitude and international aid through a heady combination of stalwart determination to hold their ground, and wacky memes. Just as their Russian foes were early adopters of social media as a tool for disinformation and passive disruption of international politics, Ukraine seems to well understand the power of propaganda as a rallying call. And while it is somewhat unorthodox to put literal profanities on postage stamps, and canonize those who utter them as national heroes, it feels extremely fitting given the circumstances. Not only does it offer Ukranians something to hold onto as they continue their struggle, the new stamp also prvides a future opportunity to mail in Ukrainian parking tickets, tax filings, and other hate mail with a little something extra spicy on the envelope.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

The move marked a resolution to two decades of contestation over the statue, which will now be moved to Cross Keys Battlefield in Harrisonburg, Virginia, where it will be stewarded by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation.Standing at 13 feet in height at the courthouse lawn, the monument portrays a Confederate regiment from Talbot County that served in the Civil War. Erected in 1916, a single soldier totes a Confederate flag and peers into the distance wistfully. The granite base is inscribed with the names of 96 Confederate soldiers associated with the county in some way, with the front reading, “To the Talbot Boys / 1861-1865 / C.S.A.” Previously positioned prominently on the greens just outside the courts where local residents would have to get essential business taken care of, the statue was a visual reminder of the persistence of unequal justice and racism in the United States. It also occupied the very spot where a slave auction block once stood.Guess what you don’t see in this picture? The Talbot Boys. The last confederate monument on public grounds in Maryland is gone. Frederick Douglass finally has the lawn to himself. Congrats to all involved @MTMCoalition @BoysTalbot  cc: @cncep @ClintSmithIII pic.twitter.com/jY0QkXlLcHThe county council voted to remove the monument in September after several failed attempts in 2015, 2016, and 2020. Subsequently, a nonpartisan coalition of local citizens came together under the banner of the Move the Monument Coalition to raise $82,000 for the relocation of the statue. While Maryland was part of the Union in the Civil War, many of its counties were divided, including Talbot County. There, family members found themselves fighting each other in battle. Although three times as many fought for the Union as for the Confederacy in the county, a promised Union monument to accompany the Confederate one was never realized. As such, Talbot County is often misremembered as a Confederate bastion in the state. A statue of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who was born just 12 miles away, does stand on the lawn, though it was only erected in 2011 after a long fight.#BREAKING: it’s a big day in Easton today: the Talbot Boys Confederate monument is coming down. The statue came down earlier. Now crews are preparing to remove the base. #TalbotBoys #Easton @stardem_news pic.twitter.com/xOFlTuHYLPPut in place almost half a century after the end of the Civil War — when the sun was already setting on the era of Reconstruction and Confederate nostalgia was on the rise — the statue was spearheaded by Joseph Seth, a lawyer and eventual mayor of Easton. In his memoir, he expressed that enslaved people “lived under a paternal, kindly rule” on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, regurgitating sentimentally violent falsehoods about the antebellum South. The statue was therefore “erected at a time when Confederate statues were used as a means of racial intimidation,” a legal complaint filed by the Talbot County Branch of the NAACP against the county in May 2021 read.A public information request late last year showed that almost 900 people had contacted the Talbot County council about the statue during a public comment period. Of that group, over 700 argued for its removal.“Frederick Douglass finally has the lawn to himself,” tweeted Maryland resident Sandy Boyd, CEO of the nonprofit Seek Common Ground. “Congrats to all involved.”It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

The number of casualties remains unknown, the BBC reports.A post on Mariupol City Council’s official Telegram page shows a photo of the wrecked Donetsk Regional Theatre of Drama with a caption that says the central part of the building was destroyed, in addition to the entrance to a bomb shelter located underneath the structure.“It is impossible to find words that could describe the level of cruelty and cynicism with which the Russian occupiers are destroying the civilian population of the Ukrainian city by the sea,” the city council wrote in a separate Telegram post. “Women, children, and the elderly remain in the enemy’s crosshairs. These are completely unarmed peaceful people. It is obvious that the only goal of the Russian army is the genocide of the Ukrainian people.”Multiple reports that Russian forces dropped a bomb on Mariupol drama theatre where (at least until yesterday) hundreds of people were taking refuge. If confirmed refugees were still inside, this would be potentially the worst civilian harm incident and an undisputable war crime. pic.twitter.com/sDfhHULLCMOn social media, the attack is being widely condemned as a war crime. While Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied that his troops are targeting civilians, countless reports disprove this. Four days ago, Russian forces shelled a mosque in Mariupol where 80 people were sheltering. Particularly harrowing was the bombing of a maternity hospital last week, also in Mariupol, which killed a pregnant woman and her baby. In a recent statement, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it has verified 31 attacks on medical facilities in Ukraine since the start of the war.The regional theater is not the only cultural center that has been destroyed by Russian missiles. On February 28, during the early day of the war, Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported the loss of dozens of paintings by artist Maria Pryimachenko in a fire at the Ivankiv Local History Museum incited by a Russian attack.According to Mariupol officials, more than 2,000 people have been killed in the eastern port city since Russia invaded. The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned of a “worst-case scenario” for residents of Mariupol unless Russia allows access to humanitarian aid and relocation to safety for individuals in danger. “We have a lack of water, lack of food, lack of medicine, and lack of safety,” Mariupol Deputy Mayor Serhiy Orlov told CBC News. “The situation is really awful and becoming worse and worse.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

In the show at the UC Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA), Spiritual Mountains: The Art of Wesley Tongson, Tongson’s paintings, including 11 his family recently donated to the museum, hang alongside works from the museum’s collection of traditional Chinese ink paintings of the Qing dynasty and early 20th century.Julia M. White, BAMPFA’s senior curator for Asian Art who curated this show, first saw Tongson’s work at an exhibition at San Francisco’s Chinese Culture Center in 2018, and its dynamism and wide range impressed her.“I was flummoxed by the way he moved from one type of painting to the next,” she said. “His splash paintings are so ethereal and beautiful.”White met Tongson’s sister, Cynthia Tongson, at that show, and invited her for a meeting at the museum with White and Lawrence Rinder, then BAMPFA’s director. They both hoped to expand the range of the collection, which has a wealth of Chinese classical work, but less modern ink art.Cynthia Tongson had decided to donate some of her brother’s art after the response she got to a show of his work, Ink Explorations: A Wesley Tongson Retrospective, which she organized in 2014, after his death.“I wanted people to know how Wesley had progressed as an artist,” she said about the show. “Even in Hong Kong no one knew how he’d progressed into finger painting. Everyone kept telling me how it was something they’d never seen before, and I realized I needed to share the work.”Because of its collection of historical Chinese painting, as well as its ties to the University of California, Berkeley, Cynthia Tongson decided to donate Tongson’s paintings to Berkeley.White says she organized Spiritual Mountains with an eye to showing Tongson’s connection to the past. “I wanted to focus on putting him in the context of greater Chinese historical perspective,” she said. “He learned from his mentors and there’s a respect and a linkage.”Some of Tongson’s teachers are included in the show, such as Hong Kong artist Harold Wong, known for his landscape painting, and Liu Guosong, a Taiwanese artist who taught a workshop in Hong Kong, and who was called “the father of modern Chinese ink painting.”Tongson’s “Spiritual Mountains 6” (2012) echoes Wong’s 1993 “Sound of the Waterfall,” with both landscapes invented. “We know it’s a mountain, and we know it’s a waterfall, but they clearly are imaginary,” White said.Tongson’s monochromatic “Untitled” (1997) shows the influence of Shitao, the Qing-era master that Cynthia Tongson says her brother most respected. The show has his scroll of a lotus from 1704 and “Reminiscences of Nanking,” from the same year. Both artists look for the essence of the natural world, but don’t try to replicate it; White observed how Tongson’s mountains are only lightly defined by their shape.Tongson studied at the Ontario College of Art for a few years and became fond of Cubism. Pablo Picasso was his favorite Western artist, and you can see his influence in “Untitled” as well. BAMPFA’s Picasso etching, “L’Homme à la guitare” (1915), hangs in the exhibit.The show also has examples of Tongson’s calligraphy, done using his hands and fingers rather than a brush. This has precedence in traditional Chinese painting, as with Gao Qipei, whose 18th-century “Zhong Kui, the Demon Queller” hangs in the show.Tongson was bold and prolific, drawing on techniques of masters of Chinese painting to make his large-scale landscapes and intricate examinations of nature his own.“I think he had an open mind to a lot of different techniques,” White said. “He started painting with fingers and hands and gave up the intermediary that the brush provided and became almost a part of the work of art. Wesley was courageous in his willingness to experiment. In the way he expresses the natural world, for example, you see what Wesley did pushing the limits of ink and paper.”Spiritual Mountains: The Art of Wesley Tongson continues at BAMPFA (2155 Center St, Berkeley, Calif.) through June 12.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Pick any weekend and you can find me wandering some echoey gallery around Philadelphia. They’re more than a pastime for me — I’m that lady in the museum who’s almost too into it, who takes pictures of every painting, leans in super close to study the details, and scribbles down notes for some reason.Museums are critical to how we interact with the vast majority of art. But I have to ask myself: if I love museums so much, why do I often leave feeling … well, kinda pissed off?I grew up in a loud, boisterous, art-loving family. Even though we were regular visitors, we always stuck out at the museum. My mom’s high heels would clack, her jewelry would jangle, and people’s heads would turn as she yelled, “Girls! Come look at this one!” “Mommmm!!” I’d whisper. “We’re supposed to be quiet here!” I think she stuck her tongue out in response.The unwritten rule of limiting noise to a minimum is just one of many barriers keeping museums from being inclusive. Big, loud families with scurrying children may not feel welcome in a place where silence rules. A recent study showed that the second most common reason for not visiting museums is “Attitude affinity perception,” or rather,  “museums aren’t for people like me.”Did you know that, on average, museums make only about 6% of their revenue from ticket sales? While many museums used to be cheap or even free, over the past few decades a number have increasingly turned to ticket sales to shore up their revenue. But if ticket sales contribute so little, do they really serve to improve our museums, or do they just exclude people who can’t cough up the change?Listen, I get it when I can’t take photos with flash — who wants to create that nasty glare in their picture, anyway? But when museums don’t allow pictures solely so that they can sell more prints in the gift shop? That’s a red flag for me. (And I was going to buy a postcard anyway!)I was quite literally jumping for joy and visibly buzzing around the galleries of the Philadelphia Museum of Art when it staged New Grit: Art &amp; Philly Now, a show that featured local artists and others with strong ties to Philadelphia. After taking in the luxurious textiles of Jessie Krimes and vibrant multimedia paintings of Jonathan Lyndon Chase, I left feeling exhilarated, but frustrated. Why did it take so long for these Philadelphia artists (many of whom are queer and artists of color) to be featured in the museum that boasts the city’s name?Museums should be uplifting unknown artists, especially artists of color. Do we really need ANOTHER take on Picasso? Keith Haring, again? In fact, I don’t want to see another Keith Haring exhibition until Angel Ortiz, aka LA II, gets his own solo show. Similar to the relationship between Jean Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol, LAII was a graffiti artist and a fundamental collaborator with Haring, and played a major role in the development of Haring’s work. Not only has his story been erased from the narrative, but he’s alive, well, and active. Where’s his retrospective?In 2020, museums across the country were forced to reckon with their institutionalized racism after the wave of protests following the murder of George Floyd. Many began featuring Black artists and hired Black curators, a much needed change — only 4% of US curators were Black as of 2018.But in considering all the “commitments” made, many start to sound the same, and for many, their progress is frankly unsatisfying. Do all of these staff trainings and nebulous “diversity inquiries” really make any progress toward changing museums on an institutional level?The Robb Report’s interviews with Black curators such as Valerie Cassel Oliver reveal that an institutional change would involve much more than the rapid-fire, publicized reforms that museums have presented to the public. It’s easy to ameliorate immediate concerns with a few long-awaited retrospectives and carefully crafted social media statements; it’s hard for a museum to shake itself free of the very ground it was built on and the clutches of wealthy (white) board members.Yes, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), I’m looking at you. Activist organizations like the Johnson Study Group have demanded repeatedly that MoMA rename the Philip Johnson gallery. The museum acknowledged this demand by covering it temporarily, and MoMA representatives have stated that they’ve been conducting “a rigorous research initiative to explore in full the allegations against Johnson and gather all available information.” Yet a quick Google search reveals dozens of articles on Johnson’s history of blatant support of the Nazi Party. Perhaps this unwillingness to change points to what MoMA and other like-minded institutions are really committed to: these legacies of weaving systemic white supremacy into modern architecture.It’s actually MoMA (the aforementioned museum constantly under fire for its institutional racism) that is often credited with popularizing the “white cube” standard. Galleries and museums alike generally adhere to the (now almost universal) assumption that blindingly white walls are the best way to show art. But do people even like this sterile approach? Visitors flock to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the Barnes Foundation at least in part for a taste of something different and, perhaps, a little cozier. In the search for “neutrality,” I think we’ve lost what many search for — a little warmth.Walking around a museum can feel a little off-putting when you know that workers aren’t being paid a fair wage — and, in the case of the Penn Museum, are even subject to union busting. Artists and museum workers have been organizing since the 1930s to gain fair compensation for making museums … well, museums. In fact, many artists are often aren’t paid at all to have their work on display. You’ve heard it before: “we can pay you in exposure,” right?Ok, not all of it, I promise! I’m not talking about touching Vermeers — but I do think there should be ample opportunity for artists to work with museums to create tactile galleries. Being able to feel the texture of a work is an amazing entryway for both kids and adults into the world of art. We limit ourselves to the visual (and sometimes the audible), but tactile galleries would open up whole new worlds.a PSA: Do Not Touch.In 2017, Lenka Clayton collaborated with the Fabric Workshop to create a room full of works by vision-impaired artists, inspired by Brancusi’s “Sculpture for the Blind.” Perhaps more institutions (and artists, too!) could follow their lead.But seriously, why aren’t there more tactile opportunities for vision-impaired visitors? The technology exists — if “The Birth of Venus” can be made tactile, why can’t more masterpieces? The Uffizi even offers “touch tours” (along with free admission!) to vision-impaired visitors. Tactile exhibitions can benefit even more groups, such as those on the autism spectrum. Could more museums follow suit?A 2008 study “found empirical evidence that museums in general lag behind other social institutions in regards to accommodating people living with disabilities, such as wheelchair users, the visually challenged, and hearing-impaired people.” Have things progressed since 2008? While several museums are finally taking note, change is incredibly slow. Many exhibitions continue to be difficult to navigate by wheelchair — and often, the art itself is the problem. In 2017, Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Room was finally made “accessible” for wheelchair users — but only through a virtual reality app. Is that really the best we can do for wheelchair users, or other visitors with mobility issues?Sometimes I anger-wander through American art galleries, just to see if they’re finally going to start putting up intricate quilts and whimsical Pennsylvania Dutch Fraktur paintings. Just one piece of folk art furniture, more Navajo blankets, I beg of you! Heaps of textiles are stored in museum archives, yet they are almost never on view in most cases. Why? If I see another quaint, pastoral, white-picket-fence painting next to a glossy “founding father” I might explode.With the exception of sketchbooks, why are drawings shown in separate glass-covered tables, rather than hanging on the walls? And although I love a work in progress, I also want to see drawings that are final masterpieces themselves! I wish we could see more exhibitions like the Art Institute of Chicago’s 2018 retrospective of Charles White’s incredible drawings. How many fields of art are we missing out on because most museums have an undue focus on paintings? I yearn to see halls of colored pencil illustration, drafting, and the entire world of cartoons! But I guess that doesn’t count as “serious art,” huh?Yes, museums are places where art can serve as a means of grappling with questions of identity, loss, and tragedy. But to be true sites of healing, shouldn’t they also be filled with laughter? What if they played music? What if they were filled with people from all walks of life, of all ages? What if they were sites of community, not just on special “family” or “community” days, but every day of the year?Even after all of these gripes, I still love museums. I’ve spent countless happy hours in their halls. They’ve shaped who I am and how I see the world around me. But the vast majority of museums have a long way to go before we can truly say that they are welcoming for anyone and everyone to visit.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

More by Isabella Segalovich							 5 CommentsI hear you about more music and happy noise in museums, but loud voices and listening to music I don’t like is torture to me. One of the reasons I don’t go to natural history museums; they are filled with school groups and families.  Art museums are one of the few public spaces where there is non-threatening quiet. Many of us find solace in quiet spaces.I’d encourage everyone to leave comments at every museum they visit. Museums pay attention and, right now, the majority of comments come from people who don’t want museums to change. We get complaints that art museum labels shouldn’t be political when we make any reference to the historical context of race, class, gender, etc that impacted the art.It must have been a struggle to compose these  grievances with a straight face. First, most museums are fighting for survival after two years of chaos. They are working to diversify their art, staff, labels, scope. My city’s contemporary art  museum reopened with a community based, salon-style exhibit. Yes, all local artists! Museums strive to be welcoming to their communities. Walls are white and rooms are fairly quiet so community members and visitors can engage with the art. Seattle Art Museum has multi media in indigenous galleries including music. Do we encourage families with kids to scream and laugh and run through the theater during a play? No. Art tells us stories about our history and who we are If you listen. There is nothing stuffy about that. It’s called contemplation. And at the same time, art  docents encourage interaction. Meanwhile, families can gab and unwind in the outdoor spaces which many museums provide. Yes the goal Is for everyone to feel welcome. But entitlement goes both ways. To my mind, this article smacks of the exact entitlement the writer condemns. And why publish it now as most museums are reevaluating all practices and policies to better serve visitors of all stripes? I’m going to end my subscription if this desperate attempt at controversy continues to override credible  art journalism.The museum I work for allows photos sometimes and sometimes it doesn’t. It depends on who owns pieces in a curated exhibition. The owners set the rules. It has nothing to do with selling postcards. Most museums allow photos of the pieces that belong to them. Instagram helps them and they know it.Love the headline and I heartily agree with many points made by the author, but as a visual artist who regularly exhibits work I have to say that having children running and playing through galleries or art museums can make it difficult for adult visitors to quietly contemplate the work. As for touching it, people’s hands have natural oils that can alter the materials used to make the work, and may cause permanent damage. Dare I say that it may not be a good idea to touch things anyway during a pandemic?  Should there be child-friendly exhibits and interactive experiences for families? Of course. Should museums be less formal? Maybe, but most of us treasure the all-too-rare peace and tranquillity we experience in these places.Your email address will not be published.

Over the next decade, he would return regularly to photograph the area’s white-walled towns, sleepy beaches, and distinctive soft light. By the time of his death in 1992, at age 49, Ghirri had taken some 2,000 pictures in Puglia, most of which have never been seen publicly. The region represented a sea change in the photographer’s work, who was known for his work in his native northern Italy, but its impact hasn’t been fully explored.Puglia: Tra albe e tramonti (“Puglia: From Sunrises to Sunsets”) is a thoughtful tribute to Ghirri’s years-long Apulian project. Compiled by the photographer’s daughter, Adele Ghirri, the book builds on a 1982 maquette for a catalogue that was never realized. Here, Adele has expanded the selection to include images from all of her father’s trips to Puglia, offering us a wider view of his work in the region. During his visits, Ghirri roamed around by car and on foot from sunrise to sunset, as the book’s title suggests. His pictures show us a place that, despite its tourist attractions, remains a quiet, earnest blend of old and new. The book opens in the ancient, narrow streets of Bitonto and other villages. Ghirri’s precisely framed photos capture the quietude of these places, and the moments when it’s occasionally broken by children playing soccer and riding bikes. Mostly, though, Ghirri is what the writer Arturo Carlo Quintavalle describes in one of the book’s essays as an “architect of space” who is fixated on the subtle hues and textures formed by the doors, walls, windows, arches, and stairs around him. Pervaded by the color white, these images have a chalky, tactile quality, but also an auditory one: we seem to feel the hushed stillness of the places Ghirri records. Gradually, the photos move to the coast, where Puglia’s beaches and boats are framed by Ghirri’s strong horizon lines and diagonal telephone wires. The photographer looks for symmetry and shapes here, too, but there’s a palpable calm and openness away from the towns’ tightly packed, enclosed streets. Strong shadows and careful compositions give a cinematic, almost narrative quality to Ghirri’s pictures without feeling too obvious.Ghirri’s trips to photograph Puglia commingled with vacation time there with friends and family. Perhaps for this reason, his images also contain a sense of ease and genuine affection beyond their sharp compositions and savory textures. It is this deep connection that will keep viewers returning to these images.Puglia: Tra albe e tramonti by Luigi Ghirri is published by Mack Books.

When Mark Alice Durant, the book’s editor, was asked by a small museum to develop a show his initial thought was to feature photos of the human body running, falling, and floating. When the museum show failed to materialize Durant added two more verbs — flying and crawling — and curated it between two covers instead. Hesitant to write a single introductory essay to connect disparate images, he reached out to a crew of critics, curators, art historians, poets, and fiction writers to respond to the included photos as each saw fit. The resulting book frames and interweaves a wide range of material: photos by 56 artists (or 58, if you count both names in two collaborations) complimented by the writings of 24 authors (and one editor). Since Running Falling Flying Floating Crawling is not intended as a definitive survey or authoritative tome, its contents follow an intuitive order curated by its editor. Themes come and go, and overlap, as do moods and associations. The texts are presented to enhance each reader’s individual experience of the photos through context, poetry, and individual rumination — but not to affirm fixed meanings. This approach respects the power of each photo to explore states of being and moments of experience outside any externally imposed framework. For this reason, the book does not have to be read in page order and is well suited to being left on one’s bedside table for random perusal at the end of the day. In that spirit, respecting no particular order or theme, the following are some images and text that made an impression. The photo that appears just before the book’s preface, “Jeno Kertész, September 2, 1923” by André Kertész, is based on a small snapshot measuring 1 1/2 by 2 inches. Representing at least three of the verbs in the book’s title (running, flying, and floating) it features a pair of inked-on wings that Kertész added to the original print. It was discovered by Durant while he was researching another Kertész photo and, in this sense, it seems to stand for the collaborative and idiosyncratic spirit of Running Falling Flying Floating Crawling.The metaphorical possibilities of flight also animate “Leap from Panchganga” by Atul Bhalla. As writer Jean Dykstra points out in her text, “Embracing the Void,” the two leaping boys in the photo “seem to merge into one multi-limbed, Kali-like creature.” The godlike potential of Bhalla’s joyous image is more than counterbalanced later in the book by six photos by Sarah Charlesworth. In “Falling, Fear of: Sarah Charlesworth’s ‘Stills’” Jennifer Blessing explains how Charlesworth culled news images of suicides from newspaper archives and enlarged them to over six feet tall to create “visual tombstones for the not-yet-dead victims suspended in midair.” A number of the photos in Running Falling Flying Floating Crawling were generated as documents of performances. These include six images from Lilly McElroy’s series I Throw Myself at Men (2006–8) — a spirited yet sarcastic take on courtship rituals — and a suite of images from the series Laundromat-Locomotion by performance artist Steven Pippin. Inspired by the 19th-century motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge, Pippin created his nude, running self-portraits in a New Jersey launderette using 12 washing machines converted into fully operational cameras. John Divola’s As Far as I Could Get series is interpreted by David Campany as standing for life’s big questions: Life’s purpose. Men’s purpose. Death. Nature. Loneliness. Time …Published by Saint Lucy Books, which “aims to publish idiosyncratic books that combine words and images that investigate the marginal, hidden, and parallel histories of photography,” Running Falling Flying Floating Crawling offers innumerable discoveries. Rich in sensations and ideas, it uses unexpected juxtapositions of text and image to offer both antidotes to the mundane and passageways to the profound. Running Falling Flying Floating Crawling (2020), edited by Mark Alice Durant, is published by Saint Lucy Books and is available online.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

In a startling conclusion, the report said the decline of the number of hate groups stems from the fact that these groups have become part of America’s political mainstream. “Rather than demonstrating a decline in the power of the far right, the dropping numbers of organized hate and antigovernment groups suggest that the extremist ideas that mobilize them now operate more openly in the political mainstream,” the report said. Although likely underreported, the SPLC found 5,680 incidents of physical propaganda in 2021, following a steady climb from 1,294 in 2018. The SPLC tracks public flyers, flyers posted on college campuses, and banners. “Despite a drop in the number of active hate groups, such an increase in the number of flyering incidents evidences these groups’—particularly white nationalist groups’—commitment to recruiting new members in ways that can also intimidate communities,” said Lydia Bates, Senior Research Analyst in SPLCs Intelligence Project. The white nationalist group Patriot Front, which defaced a statue and mural of George Floyd and whose leader was among the organizers of the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, posted 77% of these flyers, according to the SPLC’s report. The group’s rules require members to maintain active participation, which includes posting flyers and dropping banners off buildings or overpasses. Using traditional symbols of American patriotism like elements of the American flag, the Patriot Front promotes its white supremacist core tenet of America as a once-great, but declining, ethnostate state that must be reclaimed by people of European descent. The slogans they use include “For the Nation Against the State,” “defend American labor,” “revolution is tradition,” and former President Donald Trump’s refrain “America First.” But often, these groups opt for a vague language, according to Hannah Gais, Senior Research Analyst in SPLCs Intelligence Project.“Patriot Front’s vague language is a tactical choice,” Gais said. “By using more vague, pro-American language, they can try to present themselves to the world as something other than the radical white power group that they are. They know that neo-Nazi aesthetics don’t sit well with mainstream audiences.”This tactic could allow a wider audience to be funneled into the group, where they can then be exposed to increasingly radical messaging, the SPLC said. The notion of a shared White history, whether European or American, is employed by other white supremacist groups. The American Identity Movement first used images of classical European art in flyers on college campuses, but after a rebranding, now posts flyers with Rockwellian images of a mythical Americana. Other white nationalist groups and media outlets employ symbols of ancient European cultures in their logos, like Celtic knots. This is not the first time white supremacist groups have rallied around publicly-displayed visual symbols of a mythical, shared White past: Last month, the SPLC published an update to its “Whose Heritage?” project, which tracks the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials. Denouncing the removal of Confederate monuments — 168 removed in 2020 and 73 in 2021 — has also made it into the political mainstream. Yet even as more Confederate monuments are removed, visual propaganda remains an important means of promoting extremist messaging. “It’s not uncommon to see hate groups share photos of banner drops or flyering on social media networks in disparate geographical areas,” Gais said. “This ability to broadcast the distribution of propaganda to a wide variety of audiences has, at times, made these groups seem possibly more numerous and better connected than they are.”Over time, hate groups have become more surreptitious and increasingly decentralized online, according to the SPLC report. “Prominent voices in the movement now encourage members of neo-Nazi online communities to maintain anonymity and congregate in diffuse online communities rather than join public-facing groups with names and membership vetting procedures,” the report reads. Part of this increased decentralization is the rise of “influencer”-style extremists, who according to the report, rely increasingly on livestreaming. The report states that live streaming allows extremists to skirt content moderation policies: The videos can be easily deleted, and user flagging systems make it so that site moderators may not stop the livestream until it’s over. After mainstream platforms like YouTube and Facebook were scrutinized in recent years for allowing and furthering hate speech, many streamers now rely on alternative tech spaces that are more lenient in their content regulations. (The report notes, however, the failure of mainstream platforms to successfully deplatform extremists.)To prove its point that right-wing groups have become part and parcel of mainstream American politics, the report brings last year’s January 6 attack on the United States Capitol building in Washington, DC, as a telling example. “The overwhelming majority of people arrested for their role in the insurrection had no formal ties to right-wing groups,” the report said, adding that the majority of the Capitol rioters got their news from mainstream news media.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Talk about an icebreaker! The remains of the wooden ship Endurance, which carried polar explorer Ernest Shackleton and his crew on a doomed attempt to traverse Antarctica, have often been sought in the 106 years since the abandoned vessel gave way to the pressure of encroaching ice floes and sank into the Weddell Sea, but only this week were the perennial efforts of polar seamen met with success.Specifically, it was the crew of a mission dubbed Endurance22, led by polar geographer John Shears, which set out from Capetown, South Africa, on February 5 aboard the South African polar research and logistics vessel S.A. Agulhas II. The team successfully located the shipwrecked remains about 10,000 feet underwater in the Weddell Sea after what Shears described to NPR as “probably the most challenging shipwreck search ever undertaken.”What started out in the spirit of exploring the unknown became a harrowing tale of survival under extraordinarily bleak conditions. For many months in 1915, the Endurance crew attempted to extract the ship from the ice, but Shackleton ultimately gave the order to abandon the ship in October of that year. Weeks later, the ship succumbed to the pressure of the surrounding ice and sank to the bottom of the ocean. The shipless crew would travel and camp across the ice for months, seeking to make contact with the wider world until the last of them was finally rescued in August of 1916. The Aurora, a companion vessel to Endurance, tried to find a second route through Antarctica but was also trapped in ice and lost three of its crew members before the rest were finally rescued in early 1917.And yet, polar exploration maintains its allure, with the remains of this fallen vessel serving as one of the greatest discoveries to be made. The team of Endurance22 used sonar to detect the sunken ship, pinpointed roughly four miles from where Frank Worsley, the captain of Endurance, noted the location as he abandoned the stranded vessel in 1915. The crew then deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with a camera to examine the ship’s hull and the deck, confirming that the find was indeed Endurance.“We hope our discovery will engage young people and inspire them with the pioneering spirit, courage and fortitude of those who sailed Endurance to Antarctica,” said maritime archaeologist Mensun Bound, director of exploration on the expedition, in a statement. “We pay tribute to the navigational skills of Capt. Frank Worsley, the captain of the Endurance, whose detailed records were invaluable in our quest to locate the wreck.”The ship was found in remarkable condition, still oriented upright, largely intact, and hardly occupied by any life forms in the frigid water. As if to assuage any doubt, the name Endurance is still clearly visibly emblazoned across the ship’s stern.“You can see inside the hatchways, the stairs,” Shears told NPR. “You can see the ropes and the rigging. It’s as if it sank only yesterday.”The Endurance is being studied and documented, but ultimately the vessel will stay where it rests, protected as a historical site and monument under the Antarctic Treaty. Set to premiere in the fall of 2022 as part of National Geographic’s EXPLORER series, a documentary about the work of the rescue team will air globally. It is a conclusion to a maritime mystery, and a satisfyingly meta turn of events: A polar expedition becomes the destination of a century of polar expeditions.

The acquisitions were made as part of the three-year project Reframing Narratives: Women in Portraiture, which aims to improve the representation of women — both artists and sitters — on the gallery’s walls.The portraits that will enter the ranks of the gallery, located right off Trafalgar Square, are by artists Celia Paul, Everlyn Nicodemus, Chila Burman, Susan Hiller, and Rose Finn-Kelcey. As part of the initiative, the NPG, with the support of the CHANEL Culture Fund, will acquire portraits of underrepresented figures and commission new ones, while also researching the gallery’s existing holdings with the goal of “enhancing the visibility of select figures.” The museum, which has been closed since June 2020, will reopen to the public in 2023 at the end of a major refurbishment and rehang. One self-portrait, an oil-on-canvas by Paul, is entitled “Portrait, Eyes Lowered” (2019). A square painting measuring less than a foot on each side, Paul’s self-portrait is somber, rendered in ashy earthen tones. Known for her landscape paintings and portraiture of her four sisters and her mother — aside from her self-portraits — Paul infuses her drab paintings with meditation and mysticism. Aptly for this set of new acquisitions, Paul authored the 2019 memoir Self-Portrait, in which she recounts how she struggled to develop her own singular artistic vision in the face of motherhood and being passed over by others as Lucian Freud’s muse. The author Zadie Smith once described Paul as a “painter who, for ten years of her early life, found herself mistaken for a muse.”Another oil-on-canvas self-portrait, “Självporträtt, Åkersberga” (1982) by Nicodemus, marks the NPG’s first acquisition of a self-portrait by a Black woman. It depicts not just one face but multiple ones with varying degrees of abstraction: two painted in skin tone and three in solid modern shapes and colors. The amalgamation of faces in one portrait alludes to the artist’s manifold identity and life experiences. Nicodemus, who was born in Tanzania and emigrated to Sweden before relocating to France, Belgium, and finally the United Kingdom, explores themes of racism and cultural trauma in her artistic output. “I exhibited myself as a subject, showing every part of myself, my problems, my hopes, my conflicts — my whole life,” Nicodemus said about her self-portrait. “It was a form of psychological survival.”Hiller’s “Ace (retrieved),” a sequence of self-portraits belonging to The Photomat Portrait Series (1972-3), shows the artist playing with costumes and accessories in a photo booth. Hiller, who died in 2019, had attributed her affection for photo booths to the reversal of roles between the artist and the subject, as the latter traditionally assumes a more passive role in being portrayed. Finn-Kelcey’s “Preparatory study for ‘Divided Self’” (1974) is a collaged photograph of the artist engaging in conversation with herself on a bench at Speaker’s Corner in Marble Arch, London. That’s where historical figures like Karl Marx, George Orwell, and Vladimir Lenin have spoken and debated publicly on their ideas. Finn-Kelcey’s work draws attention to the tenuous position that women occupy in public space and their marginalization in political life. Finally, Burman’s “Aphrodisiacs Being Socially Constructed” (1988) is an etching and aquatint print that represents the artist in two roles: one lying down face-up on the ground, and another face-forward in the posture of a woman warrior. Surrounding her are shapes suggestive of eyes, hair, breast, and sperm. Taken together, the cumulative portrait is one of fragmented, dissociative womanhood.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC.</description><text>Hyperallergic					Sensitive to Art &amp; its Discontents				COAL + ICE, a project of Asia Society, is an immersive documentary photography exhibition that brings together the work of over 50 photographers from around the world to visualize the climate crisis.Co-curated by Magnum photographer Susan Meiselas and exhibition designer Jeroen de Vries, COAL + ICE traces a photographic arc from deep within coal mines to the melting glaciers of the Greater Himalayas, and to locations across the globe where rising sea levels and extreme weather events wreak havoc. Spanning over a century of technology, the featured imagery comes from diverse materials, from glass plate negatives to smartphone videos. Through intimate portraits and vast altered landscapes, these photographs document our relationship to fossil fuels and the consequences triggered by this continued reliance.Over the past decade, COAL + ICE has traveled around the world, visually evolving along with the climate crisis. Asia Society is honored to collaborate with the Kennedy Center to bring this show to the US capital for its East Coast premiere from March 15 to April 22, 2022, where it is uniquely adapted for the Kennedy Center. 48 projectors illuminate the 30,000-square-foot exhibition space built on the REACH Plaza.COAL + ICE brings the environmental and human costs of climate change to life through images, videos, and insightful events. A vibrant six-week programming series transforms the center of the exhibition into a stage for music, performance, panel discussions, art-making, and more.Admission to the exhibition is free, as is all programming with pre-registration, which is required for events.COAL + ICE has joined forces with a broad range of artistic, environmental, and service organizations that will concurrently present climate-related programs to diverse local audiences across the region. Dysturb and the Magnum Foundation will present #ReframeClimate, a public art campaign featuring large-scale global images of climate change accompanied by an interactive element that allows viewers to learn more about the story behind the image. Other partners include Americans for the Arts, Anacostia Community Museum, Hirshhorn Museum, National Museum of Women in the Arts, and the Phillips Collection, among others.For those not in the region, the COAL + ICE Climate “Posterator” is a globally accessible digital platform for creating original posters in response to the climate crisis.

Michener Museum presents Keith Haring: A Radiant Legacy, an exhibition of more than 100 unique and notable works from a private collection, on view from March 12 through July 31, 2022. Among the works featured are two rare Subway drawings, complete suites of many of Haring’s icon print series, and “Medusa Head” (1986), the largest print in the artist’s oeuvre.Born in Reading, Pennsylvania, and raised in Kutztown, Keith Haring (1958–1990) was arguably one of the most accomplished and prominent American artists of the 1980s. Working across a variety of mediums including painting, print, posters, drawing, sculpture, and street art, he developed a style that was instantly recognizable. Through his friendships with artists Kenny Scharf and Jean-Michel Basquiat, he became interested in the colorful graffiti art that peppered city streets, which would become a major influence on his meteoric rise.During his brief 10-year career, Haring rewrote the rulebook for contemporary art, integrating the seemingly discrete arenas of New York City’s gritty downtown counterculture and uptown art aristocracy. A friend of Andy Warhol’s, he unabashedly developed and promoted his brand through commercial partnerships, mass-market products, and even his own storefront. He was also an active participant in social justice movements, raising awareness of AIDS and fighting against racism and drug addiction.Throughout his career, Haring was featured in more than 100 solo and group exhibitions and produced over 50 public works of art in cities around the world. Many of his works were designed for charities, hospitals, daycare centers, and orphanages. Over 900 children participated in his mural creation commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. He also designed 85 posters with a pictorial language, direct messages, and universal appeal that still resonate today.For more information, visit michenerartmuseum.org.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

The suspect was identified as Gary Cabana, a 60-year-old man who was upset over the revocation of his museum membership last Friday due to two previous incidents involving “disorderly conduct,” according to the NYPD. Cabana launched his attack after he was denied entry to the museum on Saturday.    A surveillance video released last week shows the suspect barreling into the museum at 4:15pm on Saturday, jumping over a reception desk, and stabbing two front desk employees repeatedly in the back, collarbone, and back of the neck. The wounded employees are reportedly a man and a woman, both aged 24. They are in stable condition at Manhattan’s Bellevue Hospital and are expected to survive the attack.  MOMA ATTACK: Police say they&apos;re looking for 60-year-old Gary Cabana for yesterday&apos;s brutal attack inside the Museum of Modern Art. They say both 24-year-old victims, a woman and a man, are now in stable condition. But this is new video they released of the stabbing. pic.twitter.com/bS5eHo54LOThe museum was evacuated immediately after the incident and remained closed through Monday. In a tweet this morning, MoMA announced that it will be welcoming visitors again today, adding: “We’re relieved and grateful that our colleagues are recovering, and the attacker was arrested.”Steve Keeley, a reporter for Fox 29 Philadelphia, posted a video of the arrest on Twitter, showing Cabana being led handcuffed into a police car. According to Keeley, Philadelphia police arrested Cabana at a Greyhound bus station in the city at 1:30am on Tuesday. BREAKING: ARRESTED IN PHILADELPHIA.  Gary Cabana,60, the New York man who was WANTED by ⁦@NYPDnews⁩ for stabbing two Museum of Modern Art employees Saturday, just arrested by ⁦@PhillyPolice⁩ at the Greyhound bus station in Center City at 1:30am ⁦@FOX29philly⁩ pic.twitter.com/trvlH6X4VXOn Sunday, March 13, while still at large, Cabana posted an incoherent rant against MoMA on his Facebook page accusing the museum of a “frame job” and targeting a certain museum employee he named “Barbara.” He denied the allegations of disorderly conduct against him, saying he was silenced while laughing during a “comedy” film. Cabana, whom acquaintances describe as a cinephile, also suggested that he’s suffering from bipolar disorder, writing: “Bipolar is a tough road to hoe. Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.”     According to the NYPD, Cabana’s last known address was a supportive housing residence in Midtown Manhattan operated by Breaking Ground, a nonprofit that offers shelter for the homeless, the mentally ill, and people living with HIV/AIDS. He had no prior arrests.We’ve reopened today and look forward to welcoming you back. From all of us at MoMA, thank you for your support. We&apos;re relieved and grateful that our colleagues are recovering, and the attacker was arrested.Tara Varney, a close friend of Cabana who said she studied theater with him at Missouri State University in Springfield, told Gothamist that he fell into isolation after he lost his job as a Broadway usher when theaters closed during the pandemic. She added that Cabana had a history of mental illness that has worsened since he lost his livelihood. However, she expressed shock at the incident at MoMA, saying: “It wouldn’t have ever occurred to me that he might lash out.” MoMA has not responded to Hyperallergic’s request for comment.

The ample gallery rooms were quiet, the only noise the faint hush of affluent viewers murmuring to each other, shaking hands. The 150-artwork show was most recently exhibited at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida, and displays the tastes of Jacques and Natasha Gelman, late philanthropists from Eastern Europe who relocated to Mexico in the 1940s and began collecting Mexican art. The exhibition, which also features portraits of the Gelmans by Kahlo and Rivera, reflects this intimate connection. Clearly invested in the Kahlo family unit, the exhibition also puts on view documentary photographs by Guillermo Kahlo, Frida’s German father. A portrait of one of Kahlo’s sisters, Cristina, by Diego Rivera, hangs prominently in the upper gallery, stoking the drama of the infamous affair between Cristina and Diego that led to Frida and Diego’s temporary separation.The title of Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Mexican Modernism feeds into the repeated use of Kahlo and Rivera’s work, and the mythology of their romantic relationship, as shorthand for an entire era. The fanaticism around Frida Kahlo only gained steam after Sotheby’s sold her painting “Diego y yo” in 1990 for $1.4 million, becoming the first Latin American artist whose work sold for over $1 million at auction. In November 2021, the same painting sold for $34.9 million. Since then, there have been mugs, T-shirts, bags, even toilet seat covers with her thick-browed face printed on them. This paraphernalia is in no short supply at the Portland Art Museum’s gift shop. The exhibition has proudly been touted as the museum’s first featuring a Mexican artist, and one can’t help but wonder about the weight of this representation in light of the art market’s tokenization of Latinx art. The Gelman collection highlights the transactional relationship between art market and museum, and the pressure put on museums to trot out the same figureheads for each art movement. What’s more, many of the works in the exhibition are not even by Mexican artists, but rather European photographers capturing Kahlo at work and with her animals, friends, and lovers.In a less visible section, one can find a black and white, semi-nude photograph, “Desnudo” (1945), of Mexican artist Juan Soriano by Lola Álvarez Bravo. In the image, light spills down Soriano’s contoured back. This set of Bravo photographs continues with a portrait of Mexican architect Ruth Rivera Marin. Marin lays with her head tilted back and hair splayed out across a piece of driftwood laying on the shore. Her body’s lines blend into those of the land around her, reminiscent of contemporary photography like Laura Aguilar’s Nature Self-Portrait series. The exhibition also features a vibrant collection of abstract Gunther Gerzso paintings as well as early Cubist Rivera work such as “Ultima hora” (1915). In these nooks and crannies of the show, viewers can start to piece together the other, less prominent players within Mexican Modernism. But moving through the museum, many audience members floated past these pieces, flocking towards a photo by German artist Fritz Henle of Kahlo dressed in traditional Tehuana clothes with a chained monkey hanging around her neck.As a traveling exhibition, one can assume that the museum had little say in the works selected. (The show was originally organized by the Vergel Foundation and MondoMostre with the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura, with Sara Krajewski as the Portland curator.) There is, however, great attention shown to the exhibition’s framing, especially the wall texts. This framing serves a successfully didactic function that moves the viewer through the different stages and impact of the Mexican Modernist period. Other nods to the collective, rather than the idolized, spirit of Mexican Modernism, exist outside of the museum’s walls. Exhibition programming involves a mural project led by local Portland artist Hector Hernandez and featuring murals by Latinx artists. Community outreach efforts include a bilingual activity guide for children and a school partnership with the César Chavez School in North Portland, working with teachers and the artist Patricia Vázquez to design a roster of art-making workshops and field trips. Through these activities, rather than the exhibition itself, audiences might perhaps draw lessons from Kahlo’s work about loss, labor, multicultural identity, and the power of a woman’s body in pain.Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Mexican Modernism continues at the Portland Art Museum (1219 SW Park Ave, Portland, OR) through June 5.

While he brandished a pressurized mister at the rainbow radish sprouts that, over the course of the exhibition, had grown to carpet the paper pulp snaking along the floor, I asked him whether a spherical terrarium atop a plaster pedestal, “Coplee Signal Transmitter Tower” (2022), was intended to be kinetic, noting the battery pack dangling from its side. “Motor’s broken,” he confirmed.The artist MacGyvered her small-scale sonic, kinetic, and fog-emitting bricolages, which are variously activated by the viewer’s presence or a timer, using a combination of found objects, toys, motors, sensors, and craft materials. She then collaborated with friends to fabricate the animatronic sculptures’ site-specific habitat of open, multicolored yarn-and-resin ambulatories over pungent swathes of fast-growing microgreens. Park, who visits regularly to make repairs, transformed the smaller of the two gallery spaces into a Studio Room (2022) with anything that she might need to fix her installation — neatly laid out in clusters by type — including skeins of yarn, small clay figures, binder clips, a sea of buttons, patches of moss, baggies of mica powder, and (inexplicably to me) a hamster wheel and dried citrus slices. In the larger gallery space, the artist’s workshop manifests in the form of studio debris incorporated into sculptures.I don’t believe that Park is necessarily invested in the politics of failure and mechanical breakdowns. Her work’s rejection of smooth operation and concomitant conditions of productivity, pragmatism, functionality, rationality, and, above all, that art market darling, slickness, seems instead tied up with an interest in the DIY creation and sustenance of an open-ended, experimental ecosystem, a non-hierarchical space of aimless exploratory interactions — in short, play. Without adopting explicitly therapeutic or psychological aims, the installation exudes the welcoming curiosity that we might associate with art therapy and play therapy (not coincidentally, Park practices art therapy with adolescents). Instead of merely viewing the environment, the gallery-goer is prompted to enter the participatory, relational muck of it: making movements or noises to discern whether a bell will clang against the interior of a pot in response, for example, or crouching down to a toddler’s height to engage, at scale, a small drumhead topped with colorful mica powder that vibrates nearly imperceptibly. This work asks us to be attuned in an embodied way, without dictating how that attunement, or the body behind it, should operate.I questioned the apparent randomness of a few material and aesthetic choices, such as the inclusion of static human figures, often topped by clay heads with faces; the frozen dolls’ comparative literalism didn’t quite gel with the show’s perceptual and experiential thrust. But the beauty in the invocation to explore with full-bodied curiosity the strange little universe that Park had set in motion made these qualms feel like rather small potatoes.

I was burnt out and emotionally exhausted from a toxic work situation I was finally free of. The first thing I did was buy a cross-country train ticket. I needed to leave Los Angeles and be on the road for a long time. There was something about chugging along for days on end that sounded healing and peaceful. It would give me the time to collect my thoughts and process what had just happened.I specifically didn’t want to fly anywhere and arrive at a destination in a short amount of time. Because arriving meant expectations — expectations to explain myself to people I knew, expectations to find a place to stay, expectations to make plans for what to do while I was there. I wanted to keep on traveling, stay on the train, remain in this space of being in between.Being in between is a very comfortable place for me. I was born in Mexico to a Mexican mother and Lebanese father, but grew up culturally Mexican. My mom and I migrated to the United States when I was eight years old. Growing up here, I was always confused about my identity. When people saw me, they assumed I was just Arab, even though I basically knew nothing about Lebanese culture. I didn’t feel Mexican-American or Chicana either, because I wasn’t born here. But I also didn’t feel fully Mexican. This constant confusion meant I lived in the gray daily. Being in between, not fully one thing, was the norm. Despite the teenage angst I experienced as a result, my mixed identity eventually allowed me to look beyond the binary. To feel safe when things aren’t black or white, to prefer not getting from point A to point B easily.Perhaps that’s why I feel at home when I’m in transit. Every time I arrive at a new destination, there’s a sort of sadness at having to face the world again. While in transit, time is suspended. I can just exist as I am in that moment.While on the train that spring, I found a deep sense of calm watching the world go by for hours with nowhere to be, no rush to get anywhere. Time lost its linear meaning.I got to see backyards in Pennsylvania, lakes in Ohio, snowy rivers in West Virginia, and rail yards in Los Angeles. Along the way, I met train enthusiasts, bikers, retired coal miners, an Amish saleswoman going to Las Vegas, and a construction worker from the Navajo Nation on his way to LA. There was something intimate about us being on this train for hours, sometimes days. We might be totally different, but we were all, in a way, stuck there. Conversations naturally sprung up with people I would have never met otherwise.Post-pandemic travel has changed this. While road trips were a salve for me and my partner during lockdown, train trips were not. Being aware of an airborne virus while traveling for extended periods of time with masked strangers takes away that freeing nature of train travel and replaces it with paranoia. I’m not sure if it will ever be the same. But I’ll always have fond memories of that snow storm in West Virginia, staring out the large windows in the lounge car, feeling absolute tranquility, of the oranges and yellows of New Mexico at sunrise, of making it back to Los Angeles after over a month on the road, feeling renewed and with a sense of acceptance for the gray areas of life.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

In her forthcoming book, Love and Justice with Princeton Architectural Press, she recounts how as a girl she refashioned the white Barbie dolls that were available to her by cutting their hair and with a needle and thread, replacing it with more braidable hair that resembled her own. These early impulses would reemerge in adulthood when her desire to reconcile the images of beauty promoted by Western society with her own reflection. Love and Justice, a combination of art book and memoir, uses photography and storytelling to showcase Ky’s intricate hair sculptures constructed using her own hair, extensions, wool, wire, and thread. Via her social media accounts, where she has amassed more than 6 million followers combined, Ky uses her hair sculptures to address and create conversations around sex-based and racial oppression of African women, harmful beauty standards, mental health stigmas, and more.Ky credits her exploration of the online natural hair community with sparking her interest in experimenting with her hair. “One day, one of those accounts posted a photo album of the hairstyles African women were wearing before colonization and I felt inspired,” she told Hyperallergic in an interview. “They were beautiful sculptures and shapes decorated with gold, pearls, shells. I was impressed and felt the need to experiment with my own hair.”Her first hair sculpture, Ky said, was a three-foot-tall piece standing high on top of her head. “I posted it on my Facebook and all my friends and family were impressed,” she said. “I received a lot of encouragement and it made me continue.” As her practice evolved, Ky’s hair sculptures became more elaborate. “Every time I was posting, I was received more likes, comments, and shares until the day where one of my photo series went viral,” she said. “I shaped my hair as a pair of hands and created a dozen images of those hands doing different actions.” While they began as purely aesthetic experiments, the feedback Ky received from other Black women impacted and informed the direction her work would take. Ky said she began receiving messages from women all over the world telling her that her social media posts were helping them combat negative messaging about Black women’s beauty. This led her to the realization that the work she was making was inherently political and inspired her to be bolder and more direct with her hair sculptures.#internationalwomensday #feminismKy sees her role as a continental African feminist as integral to her work and the issues she addresses in her hair sculptures. She cites the clashes African feminists sometimes have with Western feminists around notions of gender and sex-based violence as another source for her sculpture’s subjects. “The experience of African women is very different from the experience of Western women,” the artist said. “Here we consider our oppression sex-based because of the genitals mutilations, the strong period stigma, the breast flattening, the strong obstetrics violence, the lack of education for girls, the forced marriage of little girls and so many other experiences we have because of our body and biology.” “This perspective caused and continues to cause a lot of clashes with Western feminists who take the oppression of women with the gender aspect,” Ky continued. “It is something I can respect but I don’t relate to. As an African artist and feminist, I have the duty to be loud about our perspective that is way too often silenced and forgotten.”Many of the sculptures in Love and Justice address the particular relationship African women have to sex and gender via photographs and sculptures that address obstetric violence, breast flattening, and female genital mutilation. Ky hopes through her continued experimentation to demonstrate the limitless capacity of Black hair, and by extension Black people, to transform, challenge, and transmute the status quo.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Want to take part? Please submit your studio! Just check out the submission guidelines.My 600-square-foot studio was originally set to be demolished in our small town, that my wife and I discovered on a walk. Built in 1882, it was a bartender’s house that sat behind a Texas saloon. We went on a limb, asked if we could save it, and the owners sold it to us for $10. We moved it across two separate rivers into the backyard of our house. We spent months rehabilitating the structure, little did we know that within a few short months the pandemic would arrive and make having a studio in the backyard a true refuge from the outside world. My process changed quite a bit, I’ve started utilizing the computer to create virtual imagery, rather than going into large cities to photograph its architecture. I’ve opened my painting process a lot because of the pandemic, I’m in the studio more, so I’m seeing the work more, so I’m asking questions more — and I ended up throwing out so many rules I used to give myself. It’s strange, because so many restrictions in the outside world have been implemented to protect everyone’s safety, that I’ve learned to not restrict my art making process.My studio was my sanctuary during quarantine and provided a quiet place to reflect, cry, and brood during those unsettling times. It also was a space of energy and possibility where my creative ideas could percolate, unfold, and manifest. I was grateful for the time to immerse myself so fully in my art, and to use the materials at hand for printing and collaging. I was led to create a series of 8 x 10” gelatin prints “We Can’t Wait” that reflected Black people’s plight in America, and the demonstrations against police brutality exploding across the nation. The stark, abstract black and white prints grew from my need to DO something. I also found myself returning to sculpture made from reclaimed cardboard, a material I gravitated to because of its association with the disenfranchised, and created new works torn and peeled from boxes already in my studio. These works I’m hoping will challenge us to envision a new way of being for ourselves and our world. These were the worst of times with so much death from Covid-19, racial violence, and hate, but somehow a wellspring of creative energy emerged for me, that seemed to make the imagined possible.This is my cute new studio which is basically the living room in my one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. I have a little nook by the window with my desk and my easel. I’ve recently started a new large-scale painting that will hang like a tapestry which occupies the entire height of my nine-foo-tall ceilings. I love to have coffee in the morning and read about art on the loveseat sofa to the right, where I sit and look at what I’m working on, then I start painting either at the easel or on the wall-hanging painting.My studio was once the hayloft of a barn, built in 1890, on a small creek in Michigan. After clearing away the raccoon nests, adding a new floor and two large windows, my studio become my most precious sanctuary, especially during Covid, when being creative was a much needed antidote to isolation. I am in a perfect setting in rural Michigan as I have access to the woods right out my window and the creek below, which offer me moments of repose, inspiration and meditation. It is also a perfect setting  to work on my current series of assemblages, which you can see on the far wall. Their components are often local found objects, barn wood, or forest detritus.In the manner of a sanctuary, I keep some areas pristine and cleared of visual stimulus, to keep my inner workings flowing and give my eyes a place to rest. During the time of Covid my work has become more naked and honest, because I have the safe harbor of my studio. It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

The Pop art icon never stopped being a museum fixture, of course, but since his death, US culture has evolved so much toward embodying his sensibility of conscious self-performance and gleefully mixing the commercial with the artistic. (To say nothing of how social media has seemingly fulfilled the not-actually-said-by-him-but-we-printed-the-legend prophecy about everyone getting their 15 minutes of fame.) A suitably large-scale documentary look at Warhol has now come in the form of a miniseries adaptation of his posthumous memoirs, produced by Ryan Murphy and Netflix. But The Andy Warhol Diaries waffles between acting as a primer on the artist and trying to go deeper into his psyche, eliding whole vital swaths of his biography while fixating on other parts of questionable relevance. Split between appealing to novices and art world enthusiasts, it’s difficult to imagine the docuseries fully pleasing either crowd.In 1976, Warhol began holding daily morning phone calls with his friend Pat Hackett, who would then transcribe their conversations as diary entries. By the time of Warhol’s death in 1987, there were over 20,000 pages of material. Hackett winnowed this down into around 800 pages to publish the diaries in 1989. The miniseries of course frequently quotes the diaries as narration, and the vibe is very different from the usual invocation of a subject’s firsthand memories. Because of the unusual way in which Warhol recorded his diary, working in collaboration with Hackett, his words already have a confessional feeling. He was not musing to himself, but talking to someone else, and it’s then easy to recontextualize these thoughts as a conversation of sorts with the viewer.This feeling is reinforced by an element which has drawn significant attention ahead of the series’ release. The voiceover is not read by an actor, as has been traditional in films like this such as the James Baldwin documentary I am Not Your Negro. Instead director Andrew Rossi employed an AI company to digitally replicate Warhol’s voice. To avoid any accusation of misleading audiences (such critiques plagued last year’s Anthony Bourdain biography Roadrunner, which deepfaked several audio clips of Bourdain without any indication that it was doing so), the series has multiple clear disclaimers about its use of this technique and that Warhol’s estate granted them permission for it. While the motivation for being so upfront may be a calculation to sidestep negative publicity, it also works almost as a metafictional flourish, the show letting the viewer in on its magic trick. It’s the one truly Warholian gesture in the project. And while we can’t know for sure, it definitely seems like Warhol would be into it. As the series quotes of him: “I want to be a machine, and I feel that whatever I do and do machine-like is what I want to do. I think everybody should be a machine.” I think he would be particularly amused that Netflix’s subtitles always designate the generated dialogue as coming from “AI Andy.”But beyond is implementation of its voiceover, The Andy Warhol Diaries is a disappointingly standard biographical doc. It has an ethereal, sentimental atmosphere that feels entirely at odds with most of what Warhol stood for, both in his work and in his public proclamations on life and society. To an extent this is obviously deliberate; the series purports to go beyond Warhol’s elaborate public façade, to explore his vulnerabilities, particularly in his tightly guarded personal life. Whole episodes are shaped around his close relationships with Jed Johnson, closeted movie exec Jon Gould, and of course Basquiat. To defy Warhol’s aesthetic when documenting him isn’t necessarily the wrong move; it’s more that Rossi replaces it with no aesthetic at all. Archival footage is deployed exactly as one would expect it to be, in dutiful pace with talking heads. (Some of whom have only a tenuous connection to the subject. Is Rob Lowe really an authority just because he once had a memorable dinner with the man?) There are utterly superfluous snippets of reenactment to illustrate private moments, so brief and vague that it’s not clear why such shots were used when extant footage or photos would have fit. Warhol himself (or, well, Warhol with the help of AI Andy) does more to engender our sympathy on his own. He confides to us that he feels like a “freak,” or that “I wasn’t very close to anyone, although I guess I wanted to be.” Of course, one shouldn’t forget that it’s possible to read even this as further performance, since it was in fact originally delivered to Hackett as a sort of audience. (And of course, since all this comes from the book, little of what’s presented is actually fresh, especially if one is already a Warhol fan.) If The Andy Warhol Diaries were more conscious of its construction, it could have even used its AI Andy to highlight this possibility, and the difficulty of ever truly getting at the heart of a public figure like this. Unfortunately, it couldn’t muster enough of its namesake’s creativity.The Andy Warhol Diaries is available to stream on Netflix.It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

A general nervously approaches Putin, his rank denoted by a series of shiny sickles on his lapels.“Sir,” he says solemnly. “The mustards have been removed from the National Mustard Museum of Wisconsin.”Putin, hanging by a thread since the decommissioning of his wax figure from the Grévin Museum in Paris earlier this month, crumbles.“Pull back the troops,” he commands. “We have lost too much.”As many have noted, Americans seem wildly enthusiastic to protest acts of international aggression toward nations of white-looking people, while remaining suspiciously neutral about analogous situations when they involve, say, Palestinians. And of course, there is nothing more popular these days than an empty gesture. One dimly recalls a political kerfuffle in 2003 when, in response to France objecting over US involvement in the invasion of Iraq, Bob Ney, then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, changed “French fries” to “Freedom fries” on the menu in three Congressional cafeterias. Dumb, but also antagonistic and fully pointless, which was actually Bob Ney’s motto during his reelection campaign (or should have been).Hypocrisy aside, there is also real concern that knee-jerk reactions to all-things-Russian mirror anti-Chinese sentiment that arose with the emergence of COVID-19, fueled by right-wing media and the then-President Donald Trump. It is one thing to remove the literal likeness of Putin from a wax museum; it is another to make the concept of being Russian a verboten quality. Certainly, if you can count on Americans to do anything, it’s to aggregate a lot of small pointless acts into a general prejudice that eventually results in violence against innocent people. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine that the National Mustard Museum’s act of solidarity with Ukraine can either harm or help the situation.“We did not ‘ban’ Russian mustards,” said Barry Levenson, the National Mustard Museum’s curator, in an email with Hyperallergic. “All we did, to show solidarity with Ukraine during this terrible crisis, was to temporarily remove the few Russian mustards that are on display in the museum,” he continued, reiterating that the mustards would be returned to the collection once peace reigns again.Levenson emphasized that this act does not constitute a ban, as neither the shop nor the museum sells any Russian mustards (or Ukrainian mustards,) and never have.“So it seems to be a major unintended brouhaha,” Levenson said. “Someone saw the sign and got it onto the internet. We did not publicize it or try to draw attention to what we did.”It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.

Titled “La Bordadora” (“the embroiderer”), the 1928 oil-on-canvas painting is an exemplar of what Rivera was known best for — portraying working-class life in his signature abstract realist style.The painting shows two women sitting at ground-level beside a large wooden stretcher frame: one stitching a floral pattern into a red tapestry in profile, the other looking on, her hand clenched and raised to her mouth, facing the viewer. The younger observer carefully absorbs the embroiderer’s skill and inherits the artistic tradition, one that has likely been passed down from generations of women. A paper box filled with colored balls of yarn sits open-faced on the taut textile. The lunar curve of the embroiderer’s long body draws the viewer’s attention to the craftwork which it cradles, and her ensemble — a fabric hairpiece, bold statement shirt, long skirt, and bare feet — is comfortable and unstudied.Rivera made this painting after visiting the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, located near Oaxaca, Mexico, in 1923, where he was impressed and influenced by Indigenous cultural expressions.“Absolutely brilliant in its construction and vibrant colors, the composition exhibits Cubist influences nevertheless, as it denotes a square arranged within an ellipse, both enclosed within a rectangle, demonstrating that Rivera never truly abandoned the avant-garde but instead, acquired a social dimension and a new ideological conscience about art’s commitment in Mexico,” Luis-Martín Lozano wrote for Christie’s in an essay accompanying the auction house’s listing.The sale makes “La Bordadora” the third most expensive Rivera painting ever sold at auction. Prior to the auction on Friday, it had never been shown publicly, and the only record that it existed was a black-and-white photograph published in the Paris journal Art Vivant in 1930. For decades, the painting’s location and ownership were unknown. It was discovered to have been in the possession of a New Orleans family collection, originally purchased in the late 1920s by James Kern Feibleman, a businessman and literature professor who was associated with an artist community that included Sherwood Anderson and William Faulkner. These New Orleans artists and intellectuals on several occasions corresponded with Mexican artists like Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros; Feibleman’s acquisition of Rivera’s painting reflected their admiration for his work.In a press release, the MFAH noted a relationship between “La Bordadora” and a cartoon by Rivera in the museum’s permanent collection, depicting an Indigenous worker leaning on his knee working in concert with several others. That sketch was a precursor to a monumental mural cycle that Rivera completed in 1928 for the Ministry of Education in Mexico City. “Both La Bordadora and the ministry murals herald a fundamental theme of Rivera’s life’s work, to capture the dignity of the everyday,” said MFAH’s director, Gary Tinterow, in a statement. “With this acquisition, we will be able to build on the foundations of our extraordinary holdings of 20th-century Latin American art to tell the story of Modernism from its earliest chapters.”It’s the second time in the span of one week that Russian troops target a cultural institution in the city that sheltered civilians.Within the well-patrolled boundaries of Madison Square Park, it’s hard not to see Hugh Hayden’s Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.By approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work.Art Indigenous Santa Fe aims to increase representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists.Art.
