        "text": "Fluctuations in Earth\u2019s magnetic field that repeat every seven years can be used to probe the inner workings of our planet By Chen Ly Diagram showing wave-like flow at the surface of Earth\u2019s outer core and background magnetic field linesFelix Gerick Diagram showing wave-like flow at the surface of Earth\u2019s outer core and background magnetic field lines Felix Gerick Small magnetic waves discovered in Earth\u2019s core could help illuminate what is going on deep inside our planet. Earth\u2019s core has a solid inner layer and an outer layer made of liquid metal. The difference in temperature between the hot centre and cooler exterior layer drives convection currents in the liquid, and the movement of charged particles in the metal creates the planet\u2019s magnetic field. The motion is turbulent and chaotic, and therefore the magnetic field varies over time. Nicolas Gillet at Grenoble Alpes University and his colleagues observed Earth\u2019s geomagnetic field between 1999 and 2021 using data from satellites as well as observatories on the ground. The team discovered that the magnetic field around the equatorial region of the core regularly fluctuated. These fluctuations repeated every seven years, drifting westward around the equator at speeds of around 1500 kilometres per year. \u201cWhat is important to know is that the magnetic field in the core evolves on very long timescales,\u201d says Gillet. \u201cAnd what we witnessed is only tiny wiggles on top of this.\u201d Although they are relatively small, studying these waves can help to improve our understanding of Earth\u2019s inner workings. There has been debate as to whether there is a thin layer of rock sitting between the outer core and the mantle above it that may explain changes in the magnetic field, says Gillet, but these findings suggest that there is no need for this layer. The team also believes it is possible to image the geomagnetic field deep in the core using the newly discovered waves as well as to predict the future evolution of the field. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that by recording the magnetic field of the Earth using satellites, we\u2019re able to image what\u2019s going on more than 3000 metres below our feet,\u201d says Gillet. \u201cThis study is an exciting advance in our understanding of how Earth\u2019s magnetic field operates on timescales of less than a decade,\u201d says Chris Finlay at the Technical University of Denmark. \u201cMuch longer time series, requiring continuous observations of the geomagnetic field from space in the upcoming decades, are essential in order to fully test this new model and to enable their potential for probing the deep Earth to be realised.\u201d Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2115258119 Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2115258119 More on these topics: "

This is the first known time a covid-19 vaccine has been used to treat, rather than prevent, the infection. Ian Lester has the rare genetic disease Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which weakens the immune system. Lester, 37, first tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in December 2020. His immune system was unable to fight off the infection naturally for at least 218 days. \u201cGiven the persistent positive PCR tests and impact on his health and mental health, we decided on a unique therapeutic approach,\u201d said Stephen Jolles at Cardiff University\u2019s School of Medicine in a statement. \u201cWe administered two doses of the BioNTech Pfizer vaccine, one month apart, and very quickly saw a strong antibody response, much stronger than had been induced by the prolonged natural infection.\u201d Lester was confirmed to have cleared SARS-CoV-2 72 days after the first vaccine dose and 218 days after his infection was detected. \u201cTo our knowledge, this is the first time mRNA vaccination has been used to clear persistent COVID-19 infection,\u201d said Mark Ponsford, at Cardiff University. Other coronavirus news England has rolled out a booster jab programme for people aged 75 and over, care home residents and people aged 12 and over who have a weakened immune system. The Office for National Statistics estimates one in 20 people in England had covid-19 in the week ending 12 March. It is hoped that the booster programme will protect people amid surging cases of the omicron BA.2 sublineage. Similar boosters are already being administered to some groups in Scotland and Wales. China reported two covid-19 related deaths on 19 March, its first official covid-19 fatalities since January 2021. Both people died of underlying medical conditions, with mild covid-19 symptoms, according to Jiao Yahui at China\u2019s National Health Commission. The deaths occurred in the province Jilin, where more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s cases have been reported amid its current covid-19 wave. On 19 March, China\u2019s reported new infections hit a rolling seven-day average of 2333 infections. Where did coronavirus come from? And other covid-19 questions answered What is covid-19?

What\u2019s the fairest way to share covid-19 vaccines around the world? Covid-19: The story of a pandemic New Scientist Weekly features updates and analysis on the latest developments in the covid-19 pandemic. Our podcast sees expert journalists from the magazine discuss the biggest science stories to hit the headlines each week \u2013 from technology and space, to health and the environment. The Jump is a BBC Radio 4 series exploring how viruses can cross from animals into humans to cause pandemics. The first episode examines the origins of the covid-19 pandemic. Why Is Covid Killing People of Colour? is a BBC documentary, which investigates what the high covid-19 death rates in ethnic minority patients reveal about health inequality in the UK. Panorama: The Race for a Vaccine is a BBC documentary about the inside story of the development of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine against covid-19. Race Against the Virus: Hunt for a Vaccine is a Channel 4 documentary which tells the story of the coronavirus pandemic through the eyes of the scientists on the frontline. The New York Times is assessing the progress in development of potential drug treatments for covid-19, and ranking them for effectiveness and safety. Humans of COVID-19 is a project highlighting the experiences of key workers on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus in the UK, through social media. Belly Mujinga: Searching for the Truth is a BBC Panorama investigation of the death of transport worker Belly Mujinga from covid-19, following reports she had been coughed and spat on by a customer at London\u2019s Victoria Station. Coronavirus, Explained on Netflix is a short documentary series examining the coronavirus pandemic, the efforts to fight it and ways to manage its mental health toll. Stopping the Next Pandemic: How Covid-19 Can Help Us Save Humanity by Debora Mackenzie is about how the pandemic happened and why it will happen again if we don\u2019t do things differently in future. The Rules of Contagion is about the new science of contagion and the surprising ways it shapes our lives and behaviour. The author, Adam Kucharski, is an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, and in the book he examines how diseases spread and why they stop. A police officer wearing personal protective equipment in Manzhouli, ChinaSTR/AFP via Getty Images A police officer wearing personal protective equipment in Manzhouli, China STR/AFP via Getty Images Covid-19 is surging in China, with more than 5000 new cases a day China yesterday reported 5280 new SARS-CoV-2 cases, more than double the previous day\u2019s count and its highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic. The surge has prompted the introduction of full or partial lockdowns in various cities across the country. China has been pursuing a strict \u2018zero covid\u2019 strategy, which until recently had largely kept outbreaks under control. The omicron variant, however, is more transmissible than previous variants and is probably driving the current surge. Cities across the country are now in full or partial lockdowns. The north-east province Jilin is the worst affected, accounting for more than 3000 of China\u2019s new reported cases on 15 March. Speaking on 14 March, Jilin\u2019s governor vowed to \u201cachieve community zero-Covid in a week\u201d. China\u2019s rising cases correspond with a global increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. A World Health Organization report reveals the number of new reported infections between 7 and 13 March increased by eight per cent compared to the previous week. The number of new weekly cases had been declining since the end of January. Other coronavirus news Face covering rules in Scotland will remain in place until April. On 15 March, Scotland reported 38,770 new covid cases, up from a daily average of 6,900 three weeks ago. As a result, coverings will continue to be required on public transport and in shops, although other covid restrictions will be lifted on 21 March. The BA.2 omicron sublineage, which is even more transmissible than the initial omicron variant, accounts for 80 per cent of Scotland\u2019s SARS-CoV-2 cases, according to first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who added it is \u201cprudent\u201d to keep mask rules in place. A small study has linked covid-19 with cardiovascular changes among unvaccinated people without any pre-existing medical conditions. F\u00e1bio Santos de Lira from S\u00e3o Paulo State University and his colleagues looked at 38 people, aged 20 to 40, less than six months after they were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Even mild or moderate infections were linked to cardiovascular changes that resulted in a raised heart rate, which affected some of the participants\u2019s ability to climb stairs or walk. Commuters exit a London Overground train, Liverpool Street, LondonAFP via Getty Images Commuters exit a London Overground train, Liverpool Street, London AFP via Getty Images Nearly 400,000 people in the UK tested positive for the coronavirus last week Government statistics show 399,820 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the UK between 5 and 11 March, an increase of 143,956 (56.3 per cent) on the previous seven days. Between 1 and 7 March, hospitalisations increased by 16.9 per cent from the previous week. Deaths within 28 days of a positive test are rising more slowly, with a week-on-week increase of 2.8 per cent as of 11 March. Easing restrictions, waning immunity and the more transmissible omicron sublineage BA.2 are thought to be driving the surge in cases. Amid the rise in infections, ministers have been criticised for scrapping England\u2019s React study at the end of March. React randomly tests about 150,000 people across the country for SARS-CoV-2 each month to gauge nationwide infection levels. Talking to The Guardian, one scientist called the move \u201cabout as far from \u2018following the science\u2019 as you can get\u201d, while another accused ministers of \u201cturning off the headlights at the first sight of dawn\u201d. Ministers are also being urged to consider offering older people a fourth vaccine dose. In England, people with a suppressed immune system, living in a care home or aged 75 or older are set to be offered an additional jab in April. Some scientists are calling for the age requirement to be set lower. However, a small Israeli study of healthcare workers found a fourth dose increased some antibody levels, but this did not translate into boosted immunity. Other coronavirus news China\u2019s covid-19 cases have doubled in 24 hours amid its worst outbreak in two years. Nearly 3400 new cases were reported on 13 March, double the previous day. This has prompted schools to shut in Shanghai, China\u2019s biggest city, and regional lockdowns to be introduced in several north-eastern hotspots. The surge in cases is thought to be driven by omicron and a rise in asymptomatic infections. Latest on covid-19 from New Scientist Many countries have scaled back their coronavirus restrictions, but Iceland is going further with a plan to let infections spread Laboratory culture system using VeroE6 cells tested negative for covid-19.Rockett et al, 2022 Laboratory culture system using VeroE6 cells tested negative for covid-19. Rockett et al, 2022 The monoclonal antibody sotrovimab has been linked to a drug-resistant mutation in SARS-CoV-2. A study in Australia suggests that sotrovimab, a treatment for covid, may cause the coronavirus to acquire mutations that enable it to resist the drug. Sotrovimab neutralises SARS-CoV-2\u2019s spike protein, which the virus uses to enter cells. Given through a drip, sotrovimab can be administered to people within five days of their infection to prevent symptoms from becoming severe. Rebecca Rockett from the University of Sydney and her colleagues reviewed the first 100 people who received sotrovimab at a healthcare facility in New South Wales between August and November 2021, when the delta variant of the virus was dominant. Eight of the people who were treated persistently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and had airway samples collected before and after they received sotrovimab. In four of these patients, SARS-CoV-2 developed spike mutations between six and 13 days after sotrovimab was administered, with these genetic changes making the drug \u2018effectively inactive\u2019, said Rockett, as reported in The Guardian. The researchers are calling for increased genomic surveillance around sotrovimab\u2019s use. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to see is resistant virus disseminating in the community, because that will mean that a lot of other people can\u2019t use this drug as well,\u201d said Rockett. Other coronavirus news The WHO has warned the pandemic is \u201cfar from over\u201d. The number of global recorded deaths between 28 February and 6 March declined by 8 per cent compared to the previous week, with recorded infections also falling by 5 per cent. \u201cAlthough reported cases and deaths are declining globally, and several countries have lifted restrictions, the pandemic is far from over \u2013 and it will not be over anywhere until it\u2019s over everywhere,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO\u2019s director-general, said on 9 March. \u201cThe virus continues to evolve, and we continue to face major obstacles in distributing vaccines, tests and treatments everywhere they are needed.\u201d A surveillance programme that looks for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been rolled out across Northern Ireland, the BBC reported. Wastewater samples from 31 sites are being collected every day and sent to a Queen\u2019s University Belfast laboratory for testing. Gauging infection levels in specific areas may help to prevent large SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, with the technology also looking for new variants. Students queuing up for covid-19 nucleic acid tests, Qingdao, Shandong province, ChinaWei Zhe/VCG via Getty Images Students queuing up for covid-19 nucleic acid tests, Qingdao, Shandong province, China Wei Zhe/VCG via Getty Images Covid deaths and new infections are continuing to decline after the peak of the omicron surge The number of global recorded covid deaths between 28 February and 6 March declined by 8 per cent compared to the previous week. In its weekly update, the WHO reported the number of recorded new SARS-CoV-2 infections also decreased by 5 per cent week-on-week. In the week starting 28 February, more than 10 million new covid cases and 52,000 deaths were reported across the WHO\u2019s six regions. Case numbers only increased in the Western Pacific Region, rising by 46 per cent. Covid deaths rose in the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions, by 29 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, with fatalities falling elsewhere. The surge in infection caused by the omicron variant appears to have peaked in February. But the WHO has stressed that countries vary in their testing strategies and therefore any trends should be interpreted with caution. Other coronavirus news However, in the UK, reported coronavirus cases have increased by nearly two-fifths week-on-week. According to government data,322,917 people reported a positive test between 2 and 8 March, an increase of 90,944 (39.2 per cent) from the previous week. Hospital covid admissions are also rising, with 8763 people admitted between 26 February and 4 March, an increase of 11.1 per cent from the previous week. Deaths have slightly declined, however. Between 2 and 8 March, 729 people died within 28 days of a positive test, 12 (1.6 per cent) fewer than the previous week. The number of cancer research studies funded in the UK fell by 32 per cent in the first year of the pandemic, according to figures from the National Cancer Research Institute. The money awarded to these projects plunged by 57 per cent, The Guardian reports. The closing of charity shops and cancelled fundraising events are thought to have contributed to the problem. Covid-19 booster jab information campaign, Putney, London, UKAmer Ghazzal/Shutterstock Covid-19 booster jab information campaign, Putney, London, UK Amer Ghazzal/Shutterstock Booster jabs substantially increased protection against omicron but efficacy starts to fall after two months The protection given by vaccine booster shots against the omicron variant starts to decline after two months, a study has found. Researchers at the UK Health Security Agency looked at covid-19 infections in the UK between 27 November 2021 and 12 January 2022 \u2013 the period in which the omicron variant started to spread widely. The data included over one million people who had been infected with either the delta or omicron variant. The researchers only looked at whether people developed a mild illness and not whether someone was hospitalised or not. They found that a booster dose substantially increased protection against developing mild illness from the omicron variant. Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were only 8.8 per cent effective against the omicron variant after 25 or more weeks. But a third booster dose of this vaccine increased protection to 67.2 per cent. However, this then dropped to 45.7 per cent after 10 or more weeks. A Moderna booster, given to those who had received two initial doses of the Pfizer jab, was 73.9 per cent effective against mild illness from the omicron variant after two to four weeks. This then dropped to 64.4 per cent after five to nine weeks. Other coronavirus news Mainland China logged its highest daily number of symptomatic coronavirus infections in two years yesterday. China reported 214 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms on Sunday \u2013 it is the nation\u2019s highest number of cases recorded in a single day since March 2020. The global recorded death toll from covid-19 has passed six million. The toll, compiled by Johns Hopkins University, stood at 6,000,394 as of Monday midday. This number is likely to be a gross underestimate of how many people have actually died from the virus globally. This is due to poor reporting and testing mechanisms in many parts of the world. BaricitinibFelipe caparros cruz/Alamy Baricitinib Felipe caparros cruz/Alamy Immune-suppressing treatment reduces deaths even in people already taking existing covid-19 medicines Another treatment has been shown to help people hospitalised with severe covid-19: an arthritis medicine called baricitinib, which works by dampening the immune response. In the later stages of covid-19, overactivity of the immune system contributes to damage to the lungs and the blood clotting system, which causes tiny blood clots to form throughout the body. Baricitinib was already being used in some countries, but a large UK trial has now shown that adding it to the other treatments used against covid-19 further reduces the death rate by 13 per cent. Most people in the study were already being given the steroid treatment dexamethasone, the first medicine shown to reduce deaths in covid-19, which also suppresses the inflammatory immune reaction. When this result is combined with other trials, it suggests baricitinib could reduce deaths by one fifth. Baricitinib works by blocking the actions of an immune system compound called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is raised in severe covid-19. It comes in tablet form, making it easier to give than another IL-6-blocking medicine called tocilizumab, given through a drip. Nearly a third of people in the trial also received tocilizumab and they still had the additional reduction in deaths from baricitinib. \u201cAs an oral agent with a short half-life and potentially less expensive, this makes baricitinib a more attractive agent after steroids in low/middle-income country settings,\u201d said Athimalaipet Ramanan, at the University of Bristol, UK, in a statement. Other coronavirus news Panic buying has begun in Hong Kong amid fears of an impending lockdown, as cases of covid-19 and deaths due to the virus are soaring. The city, which is in the middle of an omicron surge, has relatively low vaccination rates among its elderly. Two of Hong Kong\u2019s largest retail chains have started rationing some food and medicines. Measuring fourteen proteins in the blood can help predict if people will get severe covid-19, according to a study that used a genetic technique called Mendelian randomisation to link people\u2019s genes with their risk of illness. The study found six proteins that cause higher rates of hospitalisation or death and eight that protect against such outcomes. One of the risky proteins determines a person\u2019s blood group, supporting previous studies that have suggested people with blood group A are more likely to be admitted to hospital with covid-19. A woman waters plants in her houseSamuel de Roman/Getty Images A woman waters plants in her house Samuel de Roman/Getty Images Pandemic linked to increase in depression and anxiety worldwide A World Health Organization (WHO) briefing suggests that depression and anxiety have risen substantially during the coronavirus pandemic, with women and young people among the worst affected. Based on a review of existing evidence into covid-19\u2019s impact on mental health, the briefing largely attributes the rise to the unprecedented stress of social isolation, as well as grieving loved ones, financial worries and fear of infection. Most of the countries surveyed (90 per cent) have included mental health support in their covid-19 recovery plans, however, the WHO has stressed there are still gaps in care. \u201cThe information we have now about the impact of covid-19 on the world\u2019s mental health is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said WHO\u2019s Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a statement. \u201cThis is a wake-up call to all countries to pay more attention to mental health and do a better job of supporting their populations\u2019 mental health.\u201d Other coronavirus news The WHO has conditionally recommended molnupiravir as the first oral antiviral drug for people with non-severe covid who are most at risk of hospitalisation, such as older age groups or people who are immunocompromised. The recommendation is based on six studies with a total of 4796 participants between them. The review found that, when given within five days of the onset of mild symptoms, administering four molnupiravir tablets twice a day for five days can reduce the risk of hospitalisation by 30 per cent. Covid restrictions are thought to have resulted in there being 720,000 fewer dengue fever infections in 2020 than would normally be expected. The team behind the work were surprised by their findings, having anticipated that rates of the mosquito-transmitted infection would have risen when people were forced to spend more time at home. The latest results, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, contradict previous research by a different team,\u00a0 who warned that an additional 2008 dengue cases may have occurred a month in Thailand amid its 2020 restrictions. The pandemic may be intensifying pre-existing inequalities between the sexes. US researchers reviewed datasets on issues like healthcare access, economic concerns and safety for 193 countries between March 2020 and September 2021. They found girls were 1.21 times more likely to have dropped out of school than boys, while women were 1.23 times more likely to report an increase in gender-based violence than their male counterparts. In vitro fertilisationMike Kiev/Alamy In vitro fertilisation Mike Kiev/Alamy A study of 43 countries suggests the coronavirus pandemic has substantially pushed back fertility treatments, with Scotland facing some of the biggest delays. A team involving researchers at Monash University, Australia, sent surveys to fertility clinics across Asia, Africa, Europe, North America and South America from October 2020 to September 2021. Treatment delays were reported in 34 countries, with people waiting an average of 59 days for IVF or an intracytoplasmic sperm injection, when a single sperm is inserted into an egg in a laboratory. Frozen embryo transfers were delayed by an average of 60 days. These occur when embryos from a previous IVF cycle are thawed and inserted into the womb. The study, which is due to be published in Reproductive Medicine, found that the largest delay in fertility treatments was 228 days, reported by a clinic in Scotland. Austria, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Norway and Portugal were the only countries where the clinics surveyed reported no delays. On 19 March 2020, the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology advised people to avoid procedures like IVF due to uncertainty around how the coronavirus affected pregnancies. Two days earlier, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine announced a \u201cdelay (to) any but the most important care cases\u201d. \u201cThe need to stop or delay treatment was guided by the uncertainty of the virus, and the [need] to reduce the burden of non-essential medical treatments in hospitals to allow resources to be allocated to dealing with people with COVID-19\u201d, said Elizabeth Cutting, at Monash University, in a statement. \u201cWhile there was advice regarding virus exposure and transmission, there was a uniform lack of advice regarding the provision of psychological support and how to prioritise patients\u201d. Other coronavirus news Compulsory coronavirus vaccines for care home staff are being scrapped in England from 15 March. The policy previously required anyone working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to have two vaccine doses, unless medically exempt. Amid fears of a staffing crisis, the government has said public immunity to the coronavirus is now high due to widespread vaccine uptake and many people recovering from the omicron variant. Nerve damage may play a role in some cases of long covid. A small study of 17 people experiencing long-term symptoms found that 59 per cent had signs of nerve damage, possibly caused by an overactive immune response. \u201cI think what\u2019s going on here is that the nerves that control things like our breathing, blood vessels and our digestion in some cases are damaged in these long COVID patients,\u201d said neurologist Anne Louise Oaklander, reported by Reuters. Preliminary laboratory studies suggest that modified T-cells could help treat covid in people on immune-suppressing drugs. Researchers in Germany genetically modified the T-cells of people who had recovered from covid-19 to make them resistant to the drug tacrolimus, which is commonly given to people who have had an organ transplant to prevent rejection. The modified cells then attacked the coronavirus while exposed to tacrolimus in a laboratory experiment. A child receives a dose of Pfizer/BioNTech covid-19 vaccineAlexandre Schneider/Getty Images A child receives a dose of Pfizer/BioNTech covid-19 vaccine Alexandre Schneider/Getty Images Study suggests that protection from two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech covid-19 vaccine quickly wanes in children between five and 11 Protection against infection and hospitalisation from the Pfizer/BioNTech covid-19 vaccine falls relatively rapidly in children aged 5 to 11,\u00a0according to a preliminary study. Researchers analysed covid-19 cases and hospitalisations among 365,502 fully vaccinated children aged between five to 11, and 852,384 aged between 12 and 17, all of whom lived in New York. They looked at data from 13 December 2021 to 30 January 2022, during a surge of covid-19 infections from the omicron variant. The team found that, for the older children, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine\u2019s protection against hospitalisation fell from 85 per cent in mid-December to 73 per cent by the end of January. But the drop was steeper for children aged five to 11, with protection against hospitalisation declining from 100 per cent to just 48 per cent. For protection against infection, effectiveness dropped from 66 per cent to 51 per cent among the 12 to 17 age group, and from 68 per cent to 12 per cent in the younger age group. Florian Krammer, at Mount Sinai\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine, told the New York Times: \u201cThe difference between the two age groups is striking,\u201d Those in the younger age group receive a 10 microgram dose of the vaccine, compared with 12 to 17-year-olds who receive a 30 microgram dose, which could explain some of the discrepancy in the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness over time. Other coronavirus news Researchers may have found a case of deer-to-human covid-19 transmission in Canada. In a preliminary study published on 25 February, the team traced at least one case of covid-19 in humans back to a strain of the virus found in white-tailed deer. White-tailed deer had previously been found to be infected with covid-19 in the US and Canada. For the study, the researchers took samples from hunted deers in Ontario, Canada and found 17 were infected with a previously unknown strain of covid-19. They then found that one person, who had been in contact with deer, had tested positive for similar strain. Hong Kong today reported 32,597 new infections and 117 deaths \u2013 the city\u2019s highest figure since the pandemic began. The city has seen a huge surge in covid-19 cases, with only 739 new cases on 1 February. Hong Kong\u2019s fatality rate is currently one of the highest in the world, which may partly be due to lower vaccination rates in older age groups. To tackle the current surge, the city plans to begin mass testing its 7.4 million residents in mid-March. \u00a0 See previous updates from February 2022, January 2022, November to December 2021, September to October 2021, July to September 2021, June to July 2021,\u00a0May 2021, April-March 2021, February 2021, January 2021, November/December 2020, and March to November 2020.

        "text": "Nematode worms can distinguish between the molecules released by healthy and cancerous cells, and could one day be used in a cancer-detection system By Clare Wilson Light micrograph of Caenorhabditis elegans, a soil-dwelling nematodeSINCLAIR STAMMERS/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Light micrograph of Caenorhabditis elegans, a soil-dwelling nematode SINCLAIR STAMMERS/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Move over Fido. The next animal to help people by sniffing out cancer could be a microscopic worm. Nematodes, also known as roundworms, are attracted to a compound released by lung cancer cells. When put into a small device, the nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) wriggle towards cancerous cells in preference to non-cancerous ones, early-stage work shows. The approach has promise for being turned into a diagnostic test for lung cancer that could potentially use urine or saliva samples from people, says Nari Jang at Myongji University in South Korea. Other researchers are trying to train dogs to detect cancer, but nematodes also have a good sense of smell, which is important for them to sniff out their food, usually bacteria or fungi. Previous research has shown they are attracted to urine from people with various kinds of cancer. Cancer cells are biochemically different to non-cancerous cells in many ways. A compound called 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, which has a floral scent, seems to be what attracts the nematodes. \u201cWe guess that the odours are similar to the scents from their favourite foods,\u201d Jang said in a statement. Jang\u2019s team has created a test kit comprising a small chip containing some of the 1-millimetre-long nematodes within a central chamber, connected to two wells at opposite ends from the chamber. The chip is placed on an agar plate, and a drop of liquid taken from a dish containing cancer cells is placed next to one well, with liquid from non-cancerous cells placed next to the other. In tests, more nematodes moved towards the cancer cell liquid over the course of an hour. The tests showed that the nematode-containing device has an accuracy rate of about 70 per cent at detecting the presence of cancer cells. This isn\u2019t high enough to be used as a medical test, but the accuracy is likely to improve if the nematodes are trained to respond to the floral scent, said Jang. The idea isn\u2019t as strange as it may sound, as nematodes have a surprisingly good memory for environmental cues like odours, says Lindy Holden-Dye at the University of Southampton, UK. \u201cWorms are very easy to keep and don\u2019t take up a lot of space,\u201d she says. \u201cIn terms of what they can do they\u2019re relatively sophisticated.\u201d The work was presented at the American Chemical Society meeting in San Diego this week.

Interstellar travel will need human ingenuity, and a lot of patience Discovery Inc. Last Exit: Space Rudolph Herzog Discovery+ HOW will people copulate in space? How much antimatter would it take to get to Proxima Centauri b? How much skin would each of us need if we could somehow bioengineer humans to photosynthesise? These are just some of the challenges examined by documentary-maker Rudolph Herzog in Last Exit: Space, a peculiar dash through humanity\u2019s ambition to colonise space. A traditional documentary might look for answers via the press offices of the European Space Agency or NASA. Not so Rudolph Herzog, whose father, fellow film-maker Werner Herzog, narrated and executive-produced this film. Instead, the film zooms in on those who are dedicated to solving the conundrums of space travel, one challenge at a time. The result is a charming, yet unfocused and slightly odd, take on space exploration. In Denmark, we meet volunteers at the non-profit organisation Copenhagen Suborbitals who are crowdfunding to build a full-size rocket to send the world\u2019s first amateur astronaut into space. Meanwhile, in the Negev desert in Israel, citizen scientists from the Austrian Space Forum are putting a not-too-sophisticated-looking Mars spacesuit through its paces. \u201cThe possible future living conditions on Mars are compared to working in an Amazon fulfilment centre\u201d As well as looking at the technical barriers to moving off-planet, the film ponders whether it is a good idea in the first place. Among the naysayers is space anthropologist Taylor Genovese, who compares the possible future living conditions on Mars to working in an Amazon fulfilment centre. Judith Lapierre, the sole female crew member of the Sphinx-99 isolation experiment in the late 1990s, describes how this study in close-proximity living ended with her alleging sexual harassment against another crew member. It does beg the question, if we can\u2019t get along on Earth, what chance do we have in space? These issues will only grow with more extreme distances travelled. Interstellar travel will require a ship capable of supporting entire generations of humans. Lapierre\u2019s testimony, says Werner Herzog\u2019s narration, suggests that any such mission will be plagued with \u201cstrife, crime and depravity\u201d. In that case, we might be better off staying put. This, surprisingly, is the advice of a cleric from the Valley of the Dawn community in Planaltina, Brazil, who believe they receive energies from visiting extraterrestrials from the Capella star system. These apparently advise against interstellar travel, which I\u2019m sure NASA would be interested to hear. Last Exit: Space suffers from its wide-eyed, catch-all approach to the subject; I found the lack of critical analysis frustrating. We are regaled with tales of \u201cthe human pioneering spirit\u201d, as though humans were destined to explore and become somewhat less than human when not exploring. This is an opinion not established fact. Many human cultures have made a great success of staying put. Set in false opposition to this are an astonishing assortment of dystopian fantasies: space corporations will control our water! Space corporations will control our air! Astronaut Mike Foale and astronomer Lucianne Walkowicz provide the documentary with small but penetrating moments of reason. Space is an additional field of human endeavour, they point out, not an escape route from a wrecked home planet. \u201cDo we need to seek our destiny among the stars?\u201d, asks the documentary early on.

Some say the Romans reintroduced the rabbit to Britain, others point to the Normans. It was definitely the British who brought them to Australia in 1859 and New Zealand in the 1860s. A small colony established in the US in 1875 to control weeds quickly expanded across North America.

        "link": "https://www.newscientist.com/question/why-are-flamingos-pink/?utm_campaign=RSS%7CNSNS&utm_source=NSNS&utm_medium=RSS&utm_content=home",
        "text": "Jonathan Ross/Alamy By Ibrahim Sawal Known for their long legs and striking bright pink feathers, flamingos are wading birds found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and parts of southern Europe, although they have been known to flourish as far north as Germany. The name flamingo comes from the Portuguese/Spanish word \u2018flamengo\u2019 which translates to \u2018flame-coloured\u2019 in relation to their vibrant feathers, however, they aren\u2019t actually born pink. Instead, when flamingo chicks hatch they have a dull grey colouration to their feathers. The reason why flamingos are pink is down to their diet of algae, shrimps and crustaceans. The wetland habitats they call home are packed with blue-green algae, which despite their name are actually red or orange in colour due to a chemical known as beta carotene. This chemical has a red-orange pigment in it known as carotenoid, which is also found in carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach. Once eaten, enzymes in the flamingo\u2019s digestive system break down the beta carotene and the red-orange pigments are absorbed by the fat in its liver. These fats are then deposited in the flamingo\u2019s feathers and skin as it grows. As their diet is almost exclusively from sources rich in beta carotene, flamingos gradually become pink. The colouration of flamingos can vary because carotenoid levels in algae and crustaceans also vary across the world. Flamingo species found in the Caribbean are often bright red or orange, while those in drier areas tend to be paler pink in colour. Without a high enough concentration of beta carotene-rich food, the pink feathers would moult away and new paler feathers would start to grow. Although the sight of a colourful flamingo is a familiar one, there are a number of ways they can lose their distinctive hue. Carotenoids themselves can bleach in the sun, something the flamingo species Phoenicopterus roseus combats by preening themselves directly with pigments secreted from their glands, giving their feathers a lustrous pink shine. Flamingos are also one of few birds that feed their young with crop milk. Not to be confused with milk produced from mammalian species, the crop milk produced by flamingos is a highly nutritious bright pink secretion made in an adult\u2019s throat, and is so densely packed with carotenoids that when breeding season is over both male and female parents often appear white, losing the pink colouration from their feathers. Despite numerous reports of blue flamingos appearing online, there is no evidence to suggest these are anything more than internet hoaxes. However, there have been a number of sightings of a rare black flamingo in Cyprus. It is thought that it suffers from a pigment condition called \u201cmelanism\u201d, causing an overproduction of melanin making it black. "

For some, the rise of this new way to make a living has been a boon \u2013 demolishing gatekeepers, minting a new era of celebrities and making millionaires of people who might otherwise be trapped in a dead-end job. But this has been far from a uniformly good thing for society. As Channel 4 News journalist Symeon Brown uncovers in Get Rich or Lie Trying, the seedy side of social media can be as harmful as it is helpful. Brown\u2019s reporting sees him go back to the streets of London where he grew up to hear from school friends who have fallen prey to pyramid schemes dressed up as online cryptocurrency investments. He also heads to Los Angeles, where he meets nipped and tucked influencers seeking the perfect body, often ruining their health in the process. Get Rich or Lie Trying is a chastening read, clearly showing that the lowlights of online fame are as depressing as its highlights are inspiring. Brown races through the influencer economy and the different industries it touches, from the sweatshops churning out poor-quality clothing to ensure that scrolling teenagers can keep up with the latest red carpet looks on a budget, to the surgeons that perform Brazilian butt lifts, a risky procedure where fat is taken from other parts of the body and injected into the buttocks. At times, Brown hurtles through first-person stories so fast that there is hardly a chance to blink. Those he highlights as exploiting social media \u2013 or being exploited by it \u2013 sometimes pass by too quickly for us to remember who they are or why we should care. It feels a bit like the relentless hamster wheel of the algorithms that drive social media platforms, and the whole experience can become a bit discombobulating. At times, you struggle to see who to feel sorrier for: the young woman cajoled into performing a sex act on camera, or the man who is paid to receive insults online. Sometimes, they blur into a catalogue of horrors that becomes difficult to unpick and reflect on. The book\u2019s stronger sections are those that bring the action closer to home and address some deeper, more systemic issues. A chapter on how social media\u2019s unique voice is often driven by authentic Black voices that are then co-opted and copied by richer, white entrepreneurs without qualms is particularly powerful, and begins to tackle wider problems entrenched in social media. Elsewhere in the book, the bigger picture is lacking, however. We know, for example, that the drive to achieve physical \u201cperfection\u201d is an issue, and research has made clear both the role that social media platforms play in perpetuating this and the effects of such ideals on mental and physical health. Yet Brown spends surprisingly little time questioning what can be done about the broken bodies and livelihoods left behind in the race to get famous on social media, or even who is to blame. The book does a much better job of highlighting just how perilous living a life designed to go viral can be \u2013 and how quickly the thing that made you famous can become pass\u00e9. It raises important questions about the value we place on superficial appearances, and how social media all too often encourages us to sacrifice thinking deeply in favour of a neat sound bite. Overall, Get Rich or Lie Trying is well worth reading \u2013 but, like social media, at times it would do well to go deeper and dwell a little longer.

        "text": "Ozone levels above the mid-southern hemisphere dropped 13 per cent after Australia\u2019s worst fires on record due to chemical reactions triggered by the smoke By Alice Klein Australian wildfires in New South Wales, imaged by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 8 September 2019Observing the Earth/Sentinel-2/Copernicus Australian wildfires in New South Wales, imaged by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 8 September 2019 Observing the Earth/Sentinel-2/Copernicus Australia\u2019s record-breaking wildfires of 2019 and 2020 blasted smoke so high that even the ozone layer in the stratosphere was damaged, a new analysis shows. The Black Summer bushfires, which raged along Australia\u2019s east coast from November 2019 to January 2020, caused unprecedented destruction. The fires burned more than 70,000 square kilometres of bushland, destroyed more than 3000 homes, and killed more than 30 people and billions of animals. Smoke billowed all the way to South America and triggered distant ocean algal blooms. Now, Peter Bernath at Old Dominion University in Virginia and his colleagues have shown that the smoke also pushed its way up into the stratosphere and triggered chemical reactions that destroyed ozone. They analysed data from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment satellite, which monitors levels of 44 different molecules in the atmosphere. This revealed that stratospheric ozone declined by 13 per cent in the middle latitude area of the southern hemisphere \u2013 which includes Australia \u2013 in the aftermath of the Black Summer fires. This appeared to be because the smoke broke into the stratosphere and interacted with chlorine-containing chemicals left over from our past widespread use of chlorofluorocarbons. The smoke converted these chemicals into forms that are highly destructive towards ozone, for example, chlorine monoxide and hypochlorous acid. Wildfire smoke doesn\u2019t normally make it into the stratosphere, but the Black Summer fires were so ferocious that they generated their own storm clouds \u2013 called pyrocumulonimbus clouds \u2013 that \u201cpunched the smoke into the stratosphere\u201d, says Bernath. A separate study by researchers at Jinan University in China showed that this smoke injection also warmed the stratosphere above the southern hemisphere by 1\u00b0C for six months after the fires. Bernath and his colleagues found that the drop in stratospheric ozone caused by the fires lasted until December 2020 before returning to normal levels. Megafires in Australia and other places such as California are expected to become more common as climate change takes hold, meaning more assaults on the ozone layer, which protects us from ultraviolet radiation, says Bernath. \u201cAs severe wildfires rise in number, they will play an increasingly important role in the global ozone budget,\u201d he says.

        "text": "A thin material sent nerve-like signals to an alloy fibre in an artificial eye model, causing the eye's pupil to dilate and contract in response to varying light levels, which could one day help treat certain visual impairments By Jason Arunn Murugesu A human eyeair009/Shutterstock A human eye air009/Shutterstock The creation of a bionic eye that mimics the widening and shrinking of the pupil\u00a0may bring us one step closer towards helping people with certain visual impairments. Light enters the eye via the pupil, before travelling to the retina at the back of the eyeball. The retina then converts the light stimuli into nerve impulses, which are sent to the brain for processing via the optic nerve. The so-called pupillary light reflex compensates for changes in light levels by adjusting the pupil\u2019s size, allowing people to see in high resolution, while protecting the retina from bright light. This process can be impaired in people with an injury to their optic nerve or oculomotor nerve, which regulates eye muscle movement, resulting in double vision, light sensitivity or difficulty focusing on nearby objects. Xu Wentao at Nankai University in China and his colleagues have now developed a material that mimics the pupillary light reflex in an artificial eye model. If humans ever want to use bionic eyes, this reflex has to be recreated, says Xu. The material is based on the mineral perovskite, which is known to act as an artificial synapse. A synapse is the gap between two neurons through which nerve signals are transmitted, allowing the cells to communicate. In a laboratory experiment, Xu\u2019s team added the 625-nanometre-thick material and an alloy fibre to an artificial eye. When exposed to light, the material sent neural-like signals to the fibre, which then controlled the dilation and contraction of the eye\u2019s pupil. \u201cIt works in all light conditions,\u201d says Xu. The next step is to develop an artificial eye that perceives colour, says Xu. \u201cHuman eyes can recognise millions of colours and decode them at high resolution,\u201d he says. \u201cWe plan to integrate this function in our artificial eye in the future.\u201d Robert Lucas at the University of Manchester in the UK says an artificial eye with a pupillary light reflex could be useful. \u201cAny artificial eye would have to deal with the problem of resolving patterns in which differences in local light intensity may differ by only a few per cent against a billion-fold variation in overall scene brightness between starlight and daylight,\u201d he says. \u201cA light-responsive pupil could be one way to address that problem, as it would act to keep the total amount of light reaching the light-detecting surface more stable.\u201d More on these topics: "

        "text": "The final draft of legislation designed to protect people from \"harmful content\" online goes before Parliament today, but critics warn it is likely to have unintended negative consequences By Matthew Sparkes A man using a phonePeopleImages/Getty Images A man using a phone PeopleImages/Getty Images The final draft of the UK government\u2019s long-awaited legislation designed to protect people from \u201charmful\u201d content on the internet is today being presented to Parliament. The Online Safety Bill puts the onus squarely on technology companies to spot anything deemed harmful \u2013 but not necessarily illegal \u2013 and remove it, or face stiff consequences. Critics say it is well-intentioned, but vague, legislation that is likely to have negative unintended consequences. Nadine Dorries, the UK\u2019s secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said in a statement that tech firms \u201chaven\u2019t been held to account when harm, abuse and criminal behaviour have run riot on their platforms\u201d. But it remains unclear how government will decide what is, and what is not, \u201charmful\u201d and how technology companies will moderate content according to those decisions. The legislation is wide-ranging. There will be new criminal offences for individuals, targeting so-called \u201ccyberflashing\u201d \u2013 sending unsolicited graphic images \u2013 and online bullying. Technology companies such as Twitter, Google, Facebook and TikTok also get a host of new responsibilities. They have to check all adverts appearing on their platforms to make sure they aren\u2019t scams, while those that allow adult content will have to verify the age of users to ensure they aren\u2019t children. Online platforms will also have to proactively remove anything that is deemed \u201charmful content\u201d \u2013 details of what this includes remain unclear, but the announcement today mentioned the examples \u201cself-harm, harassment and eating disorders\u201d. A preview of the bill in February mentioned that \u201cillegal search terms\u201d would also be banned. New Scientist asked at the time what would be included in the list of illegal searches, and was told no such list yet existed, and that \u201ccompanies will need to design and operate their services to be safe by design and prevent users encountering illegal content. It will be for individual platforms to design their own systems and processes to protect their users from illegal content.\u201d The bill also gives stronger powers to regulators and watchdogs to investigate breaches: a new criminal offence will be introduced to tackle employees of firms covered by the legislation from tampering with data before handing it over, and another for stopping or obstructing raids or investigations. The regulator Ofcom will have the power to fine companies up to 10 per cent of their annual global turnover. Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey in the UK says the legislation is being proposed with good intentions, but the devil is in the detail. \u201cThe first issue comes about when trying to define \u2018harm\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cDifferentiating between harm and free speech is fraught with difficulty. Some subjective test doesn\u2019t really give the sort of certainty a technology company will need if they face being held liable for enabling such content.\u201d He also points out that tech-savvy children will be able to use VPNs, the Tor browser and other tricks to easily get around the measures relating to age verification and user identity. There are also concerns that the bill will cause technology companies to take a cautious approach to what they allow on their sites that ends up stifling free speech, open discussion and potentially useful content with controversial themes. Jim Killock at the Open Rights Group warns that moderation algorithms created to abide by the new laws will be blunt instruments that end up blocking essential sites. For instance, a discussion forum offering mutual support and advice to those tackling eating disorders, or giving up drugs, could be banned. \u201cThe platforms are going to try to rely on automated methods because they\u2019re ultimately cheaper,\u201d he says. \u201cNone of this has had a great success record.\u201d The government claims that \u201charmful\u201d topics will be added to a list and approved by Parliament. This is intended to remove grey areas and prevent content that would be legal under the new measures from inadvertently being removed, but some have taken it as reassurance that controversial opinions will be protected. For instance, The Daily Telegraph reports today: \u201c\u2018Woke\u2019 tech firms to be stopped from cancelling controversial opinions on a whim\u201d. The bill will be put before Parliament on 17 March, but it needs to be approved by both houses and receive royal assent before it can be made an act and become legally binding. This process could take months or even years and there are likely to be more revisions. Anything that increases the burden of responsibility and introduces new risks for negligence won\u2019t be popular with tech firms, and companies that operate globally are unlikely to be pleased at the prospect of having to create new tools and procedures for the UK market alone. Google and Facebook didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, while Twitter\u2019s Katy Minshall says \u201ca one-size-fits-all approach fails to consider the diversity of our online environment\u201d. But she added that Twitter would \u201clook forward to reviewing\u201d the bill. More on these topics: "

Now everyday chemicals like menthol and capsaicin are being used to simulate them \u2013 and create more realistic VR experiences By Victoria Woollaston  YOU open a door and it hits you \u2013 a flare of warmth on your skin. You brace yourself to go inside, battling smoke and heat. Flames flicker around you as you make your way through a burning building. You find what you came for and escape. Outside, it is so cold you start to shiver, while your hands and feet go numb. But then you remove your headset and it all stops. You just finished an incredibly realistic training exercise. None of those sensations were caused by changes in your surroundings, although they felt real. Instead, chemicals carefully selected to mimic different feelings were pumped onto your skin. Such stimulants have long been useful for understanding touch, the most complex of all human senses. In the 1990s, studies of capsaicin, an extract of chilli peppers, and menthol, found in peppermint, helped us pin down how our bodies react to hot and cold conditions. Now, Jasmine Lu and her colleagues at the University of Chicago are using this knowledge to create chemically induced sensations, to make virtual environments astonishingly realistic. In a technology dubbed chemical haptics, they have built a wearable device that, when placed on the skin, can cause the wearer to experience a range of sensations \u2013 hot or cold, numb or tingly \u2013 on demand. Its uses could include creating intensely realistic virtual worlds for gamers to explore or for training firefighters. But will we ever be able to fully replicate the experience of touching something real, and what might we lose if we can\u2019t?

Rounding a corner, a 3-metre-high luminous yellow grinning gummy bear suddenly looms over us, from which we flee through a door into a side room where Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham is talking soulfully about 100 per cent renewable trams. Not Feedback\u2019s latest cheese dream \u2013 although close \u2013 but sure signs we were on the shop floor at New Scientist Live Manchester, as part of our drive to bring the office stationery cupboard to you. Like many people, Feedback currently finds being in real places with real people a discombobulating experience that requires several deep-breathing exercises and us remembering to wear something on our bottom half. Many attendees in Manchester weren\u2019t actually in Manchester, but watching it all from the safety of their own underpants at home, which brings its own challenges, it turns out. When digital attendees complain that the main stage is freezing, getting someone to turn up the thermostat in the hall doesn\u2019t cut it. Lesson learned as the boundaries between the virtual and physical worlds slowly melt, as indeed the people in the hall did. \u201cDon\u2019t think of a black hole as a Hoover, think of it as a couch cushion\u201d. Astrophysicist Becky Smethurst \u2013 Dr Becky to her legion of YouTube fans \u2013 won the prize for the most unexpected metaphor of the event, her point being that you are less likely to get sucked into a black hole than to lose your car keys down the side of one. Or something like that. Meanwhile, we were delighted to learn from Dallas Campbell and Suzie Imber\u2019s talk on how to leave Earth about the 1638 book The Man in the Moone, written by Church of English bishop Francis Godwin, in which the protagonist flies to the moon in a chariot towed by moon geese. We would take this option, which strikes us as classier than the unspeakably vulgar rockets favoured by today\u2019s billionaire class. We also now know the current location of the first sandwich in space, what an industrial vacuum does to a marshmallow and how to make a rocket with half an Alka-Seltzer and a 35-millimetre film canister. That\u2019s definitely one not to try at home. For anyone tempted, all the talks are available in the metaverse. The 3-metre-high mutant gummy bear was, it turns out, advertising the benefits of nuclear power. Feedback regards this as brave, as we also do the UK Atomic Energy Authority titling a talk \u201cNuclear Fusion: Forever 30 years away\u201d. Still, we learn that a gummy bear is about the same size as a uranium fuel pellet, that one fuel pellet produces enough power to drive an electric car 20,000 miles and so a 3-metre-high gummy bear would make enough electricity to power 2 million electric cars for a year in the UK. This makes us happy. Meanwhile, out in the real world, the real world was still going on. The gummy bear is possibly a more appropriate unit of power for a family magazine than that contained in a tweet from the Victorian Trades Hall Council that Paul Campbell forwards us following our session on \u201chow big is a gigawatt?\u201d in last week\u2019s Feedback. It celebrates the announcement of 2 gigawatts of wind power capacity to be installed off the Australian state\u2019s coast in the coming 10 years, or as the tweet has it in an accompanying picture: \u201cSH**LOADS OF POWER. SH**LOADS OF JOBS\u201d. Clue: it wasn\u2019t \u201cshed\u201d. We idly wonder if this is now a unit of power and how many horses it would take to produce it. Around 2.7 million, we make it. They would be a truly magnificent sight riding in the waves, although we do wonder whether any of this counts as clean energy. While our back was turned, we also discover that a portion of Twitter declared 1 to 8 March InverteButt Week in celebration of the backsides of creatures without backbones. We doubt the world truly needed this, but then again, with past headlines in this august publication such as \u201cComb jelly videos are rewriting the history of your anus\u201d, perhaps people in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw\u2026 slugs. This leads us to delve rather more deeply than we might otherwise have done into the lifestyle and morphology of the bristle worm Ramisyllis multicaudata, a detailed study of which, published last year, seems to have been a prime mover of InverteButt Week. The worm lives, with delightful specificity, within sponges in Darwin Harbour, northern Australia. Its single head is buried deep within the sponge, but its body randomly branches out into up to 1000 rear ends that poke hopefully out of it. The gut is continuous throughout all these branches, yet doesn\u2019t seem to process any food, leading to speculation that the worm has \u201cadopted a fungal lifestyle\u201d. This sounds pleasingly louche, like flying with the moon geese. Even more fun is that, when it comes to reproduction, new heads \u2013 complete with brains and eyes \u2013 start forming and bud off from the worm\u2019s butts. Cute.

        "text": "As covid-19 restrictions end in many countries, we have a moral duty to cover our mouths and nose when we sneeze and avoid socialising when we feel ill, says Jonathan R Goodman By Jonathan R. Goodman Michelle D\u2019urbano A FEW weeks ago, my partner and I went out for dinner at a local restaurant. Shortly after we arrived, a couple sat down at the table next to us, and it quickly became apparent that they were both sick. One sneezed and coughed more or less continuously over the following hour; the other kept sniffling, and \u2013 in what felt like a personal assault on my sensibilities \u2013 dropped a used tissue on the floor. Personal hygiene is linked with a wide array of reactions. Most people are now taught at school that you should cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze \u2013 preferably with your elbow, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is, however, enormous variation in whether people actually follow this guidance. Research carried out in 2009 in New Zealand showed that, during an influenza outbreak, more than a quarter of people didn\u2019t cover their mouth or nose at all when coughing or sneezing. In contrast, there is little variation in how people react when encountering a used nappy abandoned in a public place. The bacteria that travel in human waste and the airborne particles released by coughing and sneezing \u2013 as we all know only too well from covid-19 \u2013 are both linked to disease transmission. Yet only with the nappy do we tend to be disgusted. With the coughs and sneezes, there are socially prescribed rules, which many of us don\u2019t follow. Now, as some countries across the world lighten or eliminate covid-19 restrictions, it falls on the public to consciously redefine the social norms around the transmission of infectious diseases. Coughing and sneezing in public can kill, just as exposing people to human waste can. We should, therefore, react with similar disapprobation. Throughout history, human behaviour has adapted in response to disease. We learned how to avoid cholera, for example, when John Snow discovered its waterborne mechanism of transmission in 1854. Over time, and as social groups grew larger and more complex, humans have changed how they live, accordingly. Rather than instinct guiding us, we learned from our elders, in a process known as cultural transmission, how to prevent the spread of dangerous infectious diseases. This pattern of adopting and passing on social conventions has been hugely beneficial for us. It seems strange, then, that when faced with diseases that are extremely infectious and potentially deadly, such as covid-19, many of us cough and splutter in public \u2013 despite the fact that this perpetuates the spread of infections. This makes each of us indirectly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people a year worldwide. One explanation may be that we have lived with respiratory viruses, including those that cause the common cold, for so long that we don\u2019t typically regard them as a major threat. Any perceived wisdom against socialising during the cold season, then, might be ignored by people who regard contact with others as more important than the risk they might pass on an infection. Now that many of the mask and isolation regulations linked to covid-19 are being shelved, we should rethink this outlook. With the continual risk that a new variant of covid-19 will arise, we need to take personal responsibility and distance ourselves when sick, avoiding mixing both at work and socially. Allowing the coronavirus to circulate freely raises the risk that it will develop mutations, allowing it to escape vaccines. Coughing and sneezing in public should be reviled. Without effective laws, it falls to individuals to protect the health of those around us.

        "text": "The James Webb Space Telescope will be used to study young galaxies, to answer questions of how galaxies assemble and to peer through clouds of dust to watch stars being formed NASA By Abigail Beall The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is NASA\u2019s successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The ambitious space observatory took off from the European Spaceport launch site near Kourou, in French Guiana, on 25 December 2021 on a European Space Agency (ESA) Ariane 5 rocket, after a series of delays. Since the project was first envisioned in 1996, its costs have overrun from $0.5 billion to almost $10 billion. JWST was fully deployed on 8 January 2022 and reached its destination on 24 January. On 16 March 2022, it focussed all its mirrors on a single star for the first time. The JWST sits at a point further from Earth than Hubble, which orbits at an altitude of around 570km above Earth\u2019s surface. The JWST sits in a Lagrange point between Earth and the sun, a point at which the gravitational pull between two orbiting bodies balance out, meaning something placed at that point can stay there with little effort. There are five of these in the Earth-sun system, and the one the JWST will stay at sits 1.5 million kilometres (1 million miles) from Earth, in the opposite direction to the sun, called Lagrangian point 2 or L2. Although the JWST is often described as a replacement for Hubble, its capabilities differ slightly compared to the iconic telescope that came before it. While the Hubble Space Telescope looks mostly in the visual and ultraviolet parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, the JWST is looking at longer wavelengths, in the infrared. JWST is designed differently to Hubble, with a set of 18 hexagonal shaped mirrors arranged in a honeycomb shape 6.5 metres across, compared to Hubble\u2019s spherical 2.4 metre diameter primary mirror. This means JWST has a 6.25 times larger surface area to collect light compared to the Hubble Space Telescope. The JWST has upgraded cameras and is protected by a sun shield 22 by 12 metres wide. The JWST is designed to peer even further back to the edge of the observable universe, looking back in time. Light from objects in this distant part of the universe \u2013 like the earliest galaxies \u2013 is highly redshifted, which means we need infrared telescopes to observe them. The JSWT will be able to see far enough to see what the universe looked like around 100 to 250 million years after the big bang, about 13.6 billion years ago, when the first stars and galaxies started to form. The James Webb Space Telescope will be used to study young galaxies, to answer questions of how galaxies assemble and to peer through clouds of dust to watch stars being formed. But it will also look much closer to home, studying nearby exoplanets and objects within our solar system such as Mars, the gas giants, Pluto, and even some asteroids and comets. "

        "text": "Netflix's new film about recent Boeing plane crashes is a damning account of why the disasters happened and who was responsible By Elle Hunt The Boeing 737 Max had a dangerous flaw in its flight control systemCourtesy Of Netflix The Boeing 737 Max had a dangerous flaw in its flight control system Courtesy Of Netflix Downfall: The Case Against Boeing Rory Kennedy Netflix AS STORM Eunice buffeted much of the UK last month, a surprising focal point emerged: the live webcam stream of arrivals at London Heathrow Airport. At one point, 200,000 viewers tuned in to watch passenger planes struggle against the wind to land safely. This mixture of fascination and fear typifies our relationship with flying. It feels risky, but we don\u2019t really expect a crash. Downfall: The Case Against Boeing, directed by Rory Kennedy and new to Netflix after a positive reception at Sundance in January, opens with the usual reassurances about the safety of air travel: tens of thousands of flights pass without incident daily all over the world. Many of these use Boeing planes, a fact that, until recently, was considered to be a good thing. Trust in the company was such that there was a phrase in the aviation industry: \u201cIf it ain\u2019t Boeing, I ain\u2019t going.\u201d Then, in October 2018, all that changed. A Lion Air flight crashed into the sea with 189 people on board, minutes after departing from Jakarta in Indonesia. All passengers and crew were killed. Five months later, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed in similar circumstances, and with a similarly tragic outcome. The type of plane in both cases was a 737 Max, a recently released update of the Boeing 737. These crashes brought to an end the safest period for commercial flying in the history of aviation. It also cast doubt on Boeing\u2019s reputation as a model of safety and the premier aeroplane manufacturer in the US. The black box of the Lion Air flight revealed a failure of the \u201cangle-of-attack\u201d sensor that measures the angle of the nose ofthe plane while in flight. Simulations and testimony from pilots paint a sickening picture of the desperate battle to regain control of the aircraft. Boeing traced this to a software failure: an erroneous activation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), new to the 737 Max. Pilots could have switched it off, had they known it existed. But Boeing hadn\u2019t told them it was a feature of the updated 737, let alone trained them on it. The former Wall Street Journal reporter Andy Pasztor, who acts as the audience\u2019s guide through the story, says a senior executive at Boeing told him that the airline \u201cdidn\u2019t want to overwhelm\u201d pilots. The anger of pilots and unions at this omission seems justified. Dennis Tajer at the Allied Pilots Association calls it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d, adding: \u201cYou want to know as much about your airplane as possible.\u201d In the fallout, Boeing, having previously enjoyed its position as the pilots\u2019 advocate, briefed journalists against Lion Air and the flight\u2019s pilot, Bhavye Suneja, saying (to quote Pasztor) that \u201can American pilot would never have gotten into this kind of a situation\u201d. The testimony of Suneja\u2019s widow stands in dignified contrast to this. \u201cI knew my husband. I knew how he flew,\u201d she says. \u201cSimulations paint a sickening picture of the desperate battle to regain control of the aircraft\u201d After the first crash, while a software fix was in the works, 737 Maxes continued to fly. Then came the Ethiopian Airlines crash. The US Federal Aviation Administration did nothing, but many countries grounded the 737 Max planes, and put pressure on then US president Donald Trump to take action. The subsequent government investigation found \u201crepeated and serious failures\u201d by Boeing. In November 2021, the airline admitted total responsibility for the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Boeing\u2019s contribution to the film is limited to a supplied statement in corporate-ese at the end. Combined with the depth of research, this lack of participation makes the film seem like a damning report rather than a one-sided one. Downfall is a brisk, level-headed account of a company\u2019s colossal failing, and the lengths that it will go to preserve reputation and profit margins, even at the expense of safety. But what makes it memorable viewing is the reminder of the trust we need when we take to the skies.

The technology could be used in prosthetics and exoskeletons, say its inventors. Alexander Badri-Spr\u00f6witz at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, and his colleagues have done away with the usual approach where every joint in a robotic limb has one actuator to open it and one to contract it. Instead, their BirdBot uses just two motors in each 3D-printed leg and long artificial tendons that cover more than one joint, mimicking the anatomy of certain birds that have lost the ability to fly and instead evolved to run efficiently along the ground. \u201cWe\u2019re using just two actuators, one to move the leg back and forward, and one to lift it. Just the bare minimum required,\u201d says Badri-Spr\u00f6witz. \u201cUsually in robotics, you\u2019re looking to improve efficiency by just 10 per cent or so, but we\u2019re seeing a 300 per cent increase.\u201d The motors pull the tendons. Power is stored in a spring during compression and released when each foot strikes the floor, to help drive the robot forward. Taking many actuators, sensors and electronics out of the system makes the robot lighter and cheaper to manufacture. It can also stand upright using no power. The BirdBot reached a speed of 75 centimetres per second in tests on a treadmill. Guides are currently required to keep the robot running straight and true, but the focus of the research was efficiency, not balance, says Badri-Spr\u00f6witz. BirdBot standing in a pondDLG MPI-IS and UC Irvine BirdBot standing in a pond DLG MPI-IS and UC Irvine Shival Dubey at the University of Leeds in the UK says the design is more efficient than more complex devices, but may also be less adaptable when it comes to carrying loads of varying weight. \u201cIn traditional leg robots, we use actuators at each joint in order to move that particular joint. They\u2019re using less energy in comparison to that and fewer electronic components,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job in demonstrating or replicating the movement of the bird, but doing other tasks will need further fine-tuning.\u201d Journal reference: Science Robotics, DOI: 10.1126/scirobotics.abg4055 Journal reference: Science Robotics, DOI: 10.1126/scirobotics.abg4055 More on these topics: "

Psychedelic drugs such as LSD, ketamine and psilocybin \u2013 the active compound in magic mushrooms \u2013 are being investigated as treatments for a range of conditions, including depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. The experiences they induce, which may be important for their therapeutic effects, are highly variable, and can include visual and auditory hallucinations, an altered sense of self and a distorted perception of time. Danilo Bzdok at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and his colleagues used a pattern-recognition algorithm to scour 6850 accounts of experiences submitted on the website Erowid, involving 27 different drugs. They linked words used in the accounts for each drug, such as \u201ceuphoria\u201d, \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cvisuals\u201d, with any of 40 receptors in the brain that the drug is known to interact with, and mapped drug effects onto areas of the brain where these receptors are most active. The researchers, who weren\u2019t available for interview, hope their work will help identify drugs that may induce particular subjective effects, and provide a framework for developing new treatments based on psychedelic drugs in the future. Daniel Barron at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, who wasn\u2019t involved in this study, says that while this tool isn\u2019t yet ready for clinical use, it shows promise. \u201cThe core idea is that if you can determine that a given drug and brain function have a predictable relationship, this paves the way to understanding whether that change and therefore that drug is clinically useful,\u201d he says. \u201cThe cultural history suggests there\u2019s a lot of potential tied up in these psychoactive drugs, but any clinical application will require that the right drug be prescribed at the right dose to the right patient at the right time,\u201d he says.

Images from this process have shown that everything is working even better than expected, and the telescope\u2019s operators say that its performance will be able to meet or even exceed the goals that were originally set for it. JWST peers into the cosmos with the help of 18 gold-plated hexagonal mirrors. For it to work properly, all of these mirrors have to be aligned with extraordinary precision \u2013 within nanometres \u2013 so that they act as one. When the observatory sent back its first images in February, the mirrors weren\u2019t yet aligned and the images were blurry. Now, although the alignment process isn\u2019t quite complete, the image is crystal clear. \u201cThis is as sharp an image as you can get from a telescope of this size,\u201d said JWST scientist Marshall Perrin at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland during a 16 March press conference. It is the highest resolution infrared image ever taken from space. The picture itself shows a bright star called 2MASS J17554042+6551277. If the alignment hadn\u2019t been precise enough, there would be multiple copies of the star in the image, but it shows that the mirrors are now all working together to create a single image of a star flanked by distant galaxies. \u201cThe telescope performance so far is everything that we dared hope,\u201d said JWST scientist Jane Rigby at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland during the press conference. There are a few more alignment steps before the observatory can take its first science images, which are expected in June or July. This image of a single star is only the beginning. Once JWST begins taking science images, it should help unravel some of the universe\u2019s biggest mysteries, from exoplanet habitability to dark energy.

As the climate crisis continues to intensify, tracking changes in temperature, humidity and other environmental signals across a wide area is useful. But doing so effectively requires dispersing sensors throughout the environment, which can be time-consuming. \u201cRather than having a person go out and individually place sensors, which can be dangerous in hard-to-reach places where we\u2019d like to do these measurements, we wondered whether it\u2019s possible to build a system that can disperse sensors in the wind,\u201d says Vikram Iyer at the University of Washington in Seattle. Iyer and his colleagues used a laser-powered tool to manufacture devices from polyimide films. Each one weighs 30 milligrams with a diameter of 28 millimetres, and carries an array of small holes through which air can pass to allow it to float in the air like a dandelion seed. The devices carry tiny sensors \u2013 essentially a microcomputer powered by minute solar panels \u2013 that can send back signals to the researchers, who developed different types that measure temperature, humidity, pressure and light. A small on-board capacitor can store energy overnight or in cloudy conditions In all, the team tested 75 different designs before finding the optimal mix of variables. The final design can move through the air at 0.87 metres per second, travelling up to 100 metres in a moderate breeze when released from a drone. Real-world tests showed that the sensors can transmit data up to 60 metres. \u201cThe fabrication of the \u2018seeds\u2019 is especially interesting, as is the design of the electronics,\u201d says Jonathan Aitken at the University of Sheffield, UK. \u201cBoth seem to be very robust to the natural environment.\u201d Aitken is also impressed by the range of the sensors\u2019 communication abilities. \u201cCoupled with the cheapness of the device meaning that it can be deployed in large numbers, [the communication range] makes this an excellent option, especially within farming or disaster area monitoring,\u201d he says.

        "text": "Most studies that have used MRI machines to find links between the brain\u2019s structure or function and complex mental traits had an average of 23 participants, but thousands are needed to find reliable results By Clare Wilson A functional magnetic resonance imaging scan of a brain taken during tasks that use working memorySignal Photos/Alamy A functional magnetic resonance imaging scan of a brain taken during tasks that use working memory Signal Photos/Alamy Brain scanning studies that use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines are often said to show links between the brain\u2019s structure or patterns of activity and complex traits such as depression, autism and certain aspects of personality. But for years, there have been suspicions that some of the headline-grabbing results aren\u2019t trustworthy. Now, that has been confirmed. Almost all such research so far has had too few participants to find reliable results, according to a study by Scott Marek at Washington University in St Louis and his colleagues. His group found that such studies need to look at the brains of thousands of people; they usually include an average of about 23 individuals. Marek and his team analysed results from three of the largest ongoing neuroimaging studies to date, including the UK Biobank study, which had scanned nearly 36,000 participants at the time. They looked at links between brain structure or functioning and two relatively well-studied traits: cognitive ability and, in children, scores on a checklist for \u201cpsychopathology\u201d, a combination of several behavioural measures. By doing multiple analyses with varying numbers of people, they showed that when small sample sizes were used, they could find apparent correlations between these traits and the brain\u2019s structure or function. But analyses of larger groups showed that these effects were either exaggerated or completely spurious. In some cases, different small samples could reach opposite conclusions, simply because people\u2019s brains are so variable that random chance can sway the results one way or another. Although Marek\u2019s team only looked at two traits, it is likely that its conclusion that these kinds of brain scanning studies need thousands of participants is true more broadly, says Kevin Mitchell at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. There is no reason to think that complex intellectual traits like people\u2019s appetite for risk-taking or their political leanings will necessarily have any manifestation in brain tissues that would be visible on a scan, says Mitchell. Results from previous small brain scanning studies of this type should now be viewed with suspicion. And unless it contains thousands of participants, the same goes for ongoing research. The new analysis may lead to the MRI field having a kind of existential crisis, says Cassandra Gould van Praag at the University of Oxford. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of The Emperors\u2019 New Clothes about this.\u201d There are parallels here with research into the genetics of mental health. In the 1990s, there were similar eye-catching claims that researchers had found the genes \u201cfor\u201d things like depression and aggression, based on small studies with tens or hundreds of participants. Then, larger studies that sequenced all the DNA of several hundred thousand people at a time showed that common conditions like depression are actually influenced by hundreds of gene variants that each have tiny effects. None of the results from small studies on the genetics behind mental health were borne out. They probably found false results because of a failure to use good research practices, like preregistering the study\u2019s methods before collecting and analysing the data, as well as checking the results in a second group of people before making any claims, says Mitchell. The field of brain scanning needs a similar overhaul, with researchers committing to proper research practices before they get funding in future. Existing small studies could still be salvaged if multiple research teams band together to produce one large study, says Marek.

        "text": "With 90 detections now under our belt, gravitational waves are solving riddles about the evolution of galaxies and missing black holes \u2013 and they could soon give us a glimpse of dark matter By Stuart Clark Ollie Hirst IN A darkened room in Sweden, beneath a chandelier and surrounded by dozens of gilt-framed portraits, journalists are listening as a phone connection is established with Rainer Weiss. It is October 2017 and Weiss has just been awarded the Nobel prize in physics for spearheading the detection of gravitational waves, along with Kip Thorne and Barry Barish. The pomp and ceremony was a fitting finale to the quest to detect these elusive waves, which had been predicted by Albert Einstein more than 100 years earlier. In truth, though, it was as much a beginning as an ending. If the traditional astronomy of telescopes is like seeing the cosmos, then gravitational wave astronomy is akin to hearing it. The discovery of these ripples in space-time had effectively given astronomers a new sense. In that room crowded with reporters, a journalist from Swedish television took the mic and asked Weiss what kind of things we might be able to learn. \u201cWell,\u201d he began, \u201cthere\u2019s a huge amount of things to find out.\u201d Less than five years later, and with scores of gravitational waves now detected, we are starting to see what he meant. These waves are providing us with a rich picture of the universe\u2019s most exotic objects, showing us fresh details of how stars die and explaining long-standing mysteries about the cosmic population of black holes. What\u2019s more, we seem to be on the cusp of detecting a whole new kind of gravitational wave, one that could tune us in to the frequency of some deeply mysterious objects we think were forged in the aftermath of the big bang. \n        Continue reading\n     \n        Subscribe for unlimited digital access\n     \n        Subscribe now for unlimited access\n           Existing subscribers, please log in with your email address to link your account access.

        "text": "Australia's record-breaking rainfall and flooding has provided an ideal breeding ground for Culex mosquitoes, which transmit the Japanese encephalitis virus By Alice Klein A Culex mosquito, the genus that can spread Japanese encephalitisKonstantin Nechaev / Alamy A Culex mosquito, the genus that can spread Japanese encephalitis Konstantin Nechaev / Alamy Australia is grappling with its first major outbreak of Japanese encephalitis, a viral disease that has already killed two people. The mosquito-transmitted infection is typically found in rural regions of Asia, but climate change is thought to have driven it further south \u2013 and other diseases could follow suit. Nineteen people have tested positive for the infection across four Australian states: Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland. A man in his 60s from Victoria and another man in his 70s from New South Wales have died from the virus. The outbreak has taken many experts by surprise. \u201cJapanese encephalitis virus was completely off the radar for us,\u201d says Roy Hall\u00a0at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. The virus is transmitted via Culex mosquitoes that have previously bitten an infected animal, such as a pig or waterbird. Experts believe the infection may have entered Australia after recent floods along the east coast created additional wetlands. These may have attracted migratory waterbirds from Asia, carrying the virus over. \u201cWe know these birds often follow flooded watercourses,\u201d says Hall. Local mosquitoes may have bitten these birds as they travelled along the waterways. Australia\u2019s mosquito population is higher than normal due to its recent warm, wet weather assisting the insects\u2019 breeding. Once mosquitoes are infected, they can pass the virus to dense populations of pigs in commercial farms, causing an \u201camplifying effect\u201d, says Hall. Mosquitoes that bite infected pigs can spread the virus to people who work with or live near the animals. Japanese encephalitis cannot spread from person to person. The virus has already been detected in pigs at more than 20 Australian farms, with some fearing the infection could spread to the country\u2019s millions of feral pigs. \u201cThese pigs move over very wide ranges,\u201d says Gregor Devine\u00a0at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane. Record-breaking rainfall, flooding and warm temperatures may have created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d that allowed the Japanese encephalitis virus to gain a foothold in Australia, with climate change potentially being to blame, says\u00a0Karin Leder\u00a0at Monash University in Melbourne. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing changes in rainfall and temperature that are affecting the behaviours of the birds that host the virus, as well as increased breeding of the mosquitoes that spread it,\u201d she says. The Japanese encephalitis virus has previously been detected in a handful of people in Australia\u2019s Torres Strait Islands, north of the mainland. The ongoing outbreak is a first for mainland Australia. The vast majority of people who become infected develop no symptoms or experience mild, flu-like discomfort. The virus spreads to the brain in about 1 in 250 cases, causing complications like seizures, tremors and paralysis. Up to 1 in 3 people who develop these severe symptoms die as a result of the infection. In Asia and Western Pacific regions, an estimated 13,600 to 20,400 people die from Japanese encephalitis every year. Children are most likely to be affected. There is no cure, but administering fluids and oxygen can support the body while it fights off the virus. Vaccines can ward off infection. However, Australia only has 15,000 doses in its stockpile. The government says it is importing another 130,000 doses, which will be available from late March. Vaccines will initially be\u00a0prioritised for high-risk groups,\u00a0like piggery workers and veterinarians. \u201cWhen we know more about the magnitude of risk in various geographic areas, we\u2019ll be able to make informed decisions about who else should be vaccinated,\u201d says Leder. In the meantime, people who live in mosquito-dense areas should wear long-sleeved clothing, apply mosquito repellent and remove stagnant water from around their house, she says. Now the Japanese encephalitis virus has been found animal hosts in Australia, it is \u201chere to stay\u201d, says Devine. \u201cSometimes it will be unseen and sometimes it will spill over [into humans], but it\u2019s not going to disappear,\u201d he says. Climate change is also expected to increase the prevalence of other mosquito-borne diseases in Australia, says Devine. For example, dengue-carrying mosquitoes that reside in northern Australia could migrate south as it gets warmer, he says. Australia should be better prepared for a rise in mosquito-transmitted viruses by ensuring appropriate tests are ready and building the capacity to make vaccines locally, says Hall. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more mosquito-borne diseases,\u201d he says. \u201cExactly where, exactly when, we don\u2019t know, but it will happen.\u201d More on these topics: "

        "text": "A computer model suggests that wildlife may face survival problems if some of the humans in the environment help wild animals while others hunt them By Christa Lest\u00e9-Lasserre Feeding wild animals might give them the misleading impression that all humans will offer assistanced3sign/Getty Images Feeding wild animals might give them the misleading impression that all humans will offer assistance d3sign/Getty Images Well-meaning humans might be inadvertently putting wildlife in danger by being kind and generous, in a world where not all humans are kind and generous. Wild animals might quickly learn whether humans are trustworthy, based on their own experiences and those of their group members. But different humans act differently towards animals \u2013 and these \u201cmixed messages\u201d put animals at risk of trusting the wrong humans, says Madeleine Goumas at the University of Exeter, UK. \u201cWhen we feed wild animals, for example, it feels nice for us, and it\u2019s a selfless thing we\u2019re doing,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know later on if that animal is going to wander up to someone who\u2019s not going to be as appreciative.\u201d Unlike other animals \u2013 especially predators \u2013 humans show widely different individual behaviours towards other species, says Goumas. Some people ignore or avoid wild animals; others approach, feed or even pet them; and still others pursue, capture, harm or hunt them. This makes it complicated for animals to know how to act around humans \u2013 especially because they can benefit if they feel safe around people while their non-human predators don\u2019t. Goumas and her colleagues have developed a computer model to assess how wild animals cope with the mixed messages that humans send out. The model allows for animals to learn information about humans in different ways \u2013 by learning from observing other animals, for instance \u2013 and at different speeds. It also allows for human populations containing different mixes of friendly or hostile people, and gives the animals different abilities to recognise and remember which humans were which. The model suggests that animals that learn rapidly whether to trust humans are better able to survive in places where humans generally act in the same way \u2013 either being friendly or hostile to animals \u2013 says Goumas. Transferring those findings to the real world means, for example, that deer can take advantage of more grazing grounds in urban areas, where people leave them alone or are even friendly to them. Deer living in wooded areas that are popular among hunters, meanwhile, can survive better by quickly learning to hide from people. However, the model also suggests that fast learning in places where different people in the human population have different attitudes towards wild animals can be detrimental, says Goumas. The simulated animals in these environments quickly made conclusions about all humans based on a single good or bad experience. \u201cWe tend to think \u2018learning quickly sounds good\u2019, and that it must always be better,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the problem is \u2026 it can be a bit excessive.\u201d The model suggests that being capable of clearly recognising individual humans as friendly or hostile isn\u2019t always beneficial, says Goumas. This is because by learning about each new person individually, rather than generalising, she says, animals can waste valuable time that would be better spent either taking advantage of available resources, or fleeing imminent danger. Not all species are capable of individual recognition of humans anyway \u2013 although well-meaning humans sometimes make such dangerous assumptions, says Goumas. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people on social media saying, \u2018Oh it\u2019s fine to feed these animals, because they know me, and they wouldn\u2019t go up to other people\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you just don\u2019t know that. It\u2019s putting them [the animals] in a very vulnerable position, especially when we still really don\u2019t know much about how animals are perceiving us.\u201d Journal reference: Royal Society Open Science, DOI: 10.1098/rsos.211742 Journal reference: Royal Society Open Science, DOI: 10.1098/rsos.211742 More on these topics: "

Half of the participants were asked to watch an approximately 4-minute-long silent YouTube video showing two commercial pilots landing a plane in a mountainous area. The researchers then gave each participant a hypothetical scenario: Imagine you are on a small commuter plane. Due to an emergency, the pilot is incapacitated and you are the only person left to land the plane. They then asked the participants how confident they would feel \u2013 on a percentage scale \u2013 about responding to the situation. They found that people who had watched the video were up to 30 per cent more confident in their ability to land a plane without dying, compared with the confidence ratings of those who hadn\u2019t watched the video. But even people who hadn\u2019t watched the video gave themselves an average confidence score of 29 per cent for their ability to land the plane without dying, says Garry. Some participants who watched the video were asked prior to doing so how confident they were that they could land the plane as well as any trained pilot. After watching the video, their self-confidence rose: they were up to 38 per cent more confident that they could perform as well as any trained pilot. In general, men were significantly more confident in their abilities than women, she adds. The results were particularly surprising, the researchers say, given that the respondents in general were convinced that landing a plane requires a great deal of expertise. They ranked the required skill level for landing a plane at an average of 4.4 out of 5, says Garry. Trained pilots learn to land planes after hundreds of hours of training and education in physics, engineering and meteorology, she adds. Garry says the findings suggest that people \u201ctend to inflate their confidence about certain things\u201d as a result of what she calls a \u201crapid illusion\u201d, meaning they see images that make them believe they are capable of feats for which they have no skill. The results suggest this applies to a \u201cdisturbing proportion of ordinary people\u201d, she says. While overconfidence has its benefits \u2013 for example, giving people a boost that helps them take on life\u2019s challenges \u2013 it can also be detrimental when it puts lives in danger, says Kayla Jordan, also at the University of Waikato. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty surprising that people become more confident they could carry out this highly specialised feat \u2013 while at the same time telling us they know that landing a plane requires a great deal of expertise,\u201d says Jordan.

The test was a success and is now being expanded, says Oxitec, the UK-based company that created the modified armyworms. Fall armyworms (Spodoptera frugiperda) are in fact moth caterpillars. They get their name from the fact that they multiply very fast and feed on many plants. Swarms of armyworms can devastate everything from lawns to crops in just days. They are native to the Americas, but in recent years have spread across Africa, Asia and Australia, reducing harvests of some crops by up to half. Conventional control methods aren\u2019t working well because some strains have evolved resistance to many pesticides. \u201cThere is a lot of interest in new solutions to this pest,\u201d says Neil Morrison at Oxitec. \u201cGrowers are struggling to control it through insecticidal means.\u201d For its method of control, Oxitec took a strain of fall armyworm that is still susceptible to pesticides and modified males so that their female offspring can survive only in the presence of a specific chemical. In other words, the males carry a gene that kills all their female offspring\u00a0in the wild. When the modified fall armyworms are released, they mate with wild females. Only male offspring survive, and they can mate and spread the female-killing gene to another generation. Unlike with pesticides, no other species are harmed. If no more \u201cFriendly\u2122 fall armyworms\u201d, as Oxitec calls them, are released, the female-killing genes rapidly disappear from the wild population. If large enough numbers of modified males are released, wild armyworms can be wiped out locally. That is the theory, at least. Future trials will evaluate effectiveness, says Morrison. The initial farm trial was only intended to test whether the released males behave as expected. \u201cFor instance, after we stop releasing, does the self-limiting gene disappear from the environment? Yes, it does,\u201d he says. The approach has already been approved in Brazil. \u201cWe can deploy those Friendly males anywhere in Brazil without restriction,\u201d says Morrison. Oxitec is already selling \u201cFriendly\u2122 Aedes aegypti\u201d mosquitoes in Brazil to prevent the spread of diseases such as Zika and dengue. On 8 March, it got the go-ahead for their use in pilot projects in California and Florida. More on these topics: "

        "text": "Climate change may see pollen season in the US begin earlier and end later by the end of the century \u2013 and those with hay fever may experience worse symptoms as pollen emissions could rise by as much as 250 per cent By Jason Arunn Murugesu Green clover leaves surrounded by pollenpublic domain sourced/access rights from Antonio Saez Caro/Alamy Green clover leaves surrounded by pollen public domain sourced/access rights from Antonio Saez Caro/Alamy Pollen season may start up to 40 days earlier by the end of the century in the US if temperatures continue to rise as predicted. It could also last longer and be more intense. Allergies induced by pollen such as hay fever affect up to 30 per cent of the world\u2019s population. \u201cWe have already seen a change in the pollen count in the last few decades,\u201d says Yingxiao Zhang at the University of Michigan. \u201cThe increase in pollen in the atmosphere starts earlier now and the main driver of that is temperature change.\u201d Zhang and her colleagues wanted to find out what pollen season may look like at the end of the century. The team combined climate models with data taken between 1995 and 2014 from sites across the US for levels of 13 of the most common types of pollen in order to predict levels between 1981 and 2100. The researchers found that plants would start releasing pollen up to 40 days earlier if temperatures in the US rose between 4 and 6\u00b0C. For example, pollen released by alder trees (Alnus) may peak in February rather than March. They also found that plants that pollinate later in the year such as grasses may do so up to 19 days later \u2013 lengthening pollen season and increasing annual pollen emissions across the US by between 16 and 40 per cent. Factors other than temperature would have an effect too: increasing carbon dioxide levels could have the biggest impact on pollen emissions. Based on findings from previous lab studies, the researchers found that the predicted atmospheric CO2 rise this century may increase pollen emissions across the US by up to 250 per cent. The researchers say that CO2 may have such a big effect because it has such a crucial role in photosynthesis. \u201cMore carbon dioxide may mean plants grow bigger and stronger and this would impact the release of pollen,\u201d says Zhang. \u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of uncertainty in that result as we don\u2019t have a lot of data on the effects of carbon dioxide on pollen,\u201d she says. Anyone with hay fever will fare far worse if these predictions come true, Zhang says, as pollen season will be longer and daily pollen counts will also be higher. But the study didn\u2019t take into account other effects, such as a likely rise in the number of droughts and floods due to climate change. These will also influence plant life and therefore pollen count. \u201cFor nearly all children with asthma, more pollen means greater chances they\u2019ll have an asthma attack,\u201d says Aaron Bernstein at Harvard University. \u201cSo we can hope that this study got it wrong, but odds are it didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe already know we have so much to gain for the health of our children, especially children growing up in poverty, when we act on climate change, and I hope that this study gives still greater incentive for the parents of the 6 million children with asthma in the US to call for policies that will prevent needless suffering for our nation\u2019s children.\u201d Journal reference: Nature Communications, DOI: 10.1038/s41467-022-28764-0 Journal reference: Nature Communications, DOI: 10.1038/s41467-022-28764-0 Sign up to our free Fix the Planet newsletter to get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox, every Thursday More on these topics: "

The space rock, named 2022 EB5, was first detected at around 7.20pm GMT at Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Station Observatory in Hungary by Kriszti\u00e1n S\u00e1rneczky, an astronomer at Konkoly Observatory in Budapest. Other astronomers were then able to track it before it plunged through the skies to the north-east of Iceland just after 9.20pm GMT. It is one of only five asteroids to have been found and observed before hitting Earth. \u201cThe very rapid dissemination of information from the discoverers allowed other astronomers to make more observations from different vantage points with enough lead time to calculate a precise orbit and its intersection with Earth,\u201d says Mark Boslough, an asteroid impact specialist at the University of New Mexico. Thankfully, the asteroid was sufficiently small that it posed little danger \u2013 provisional estimates suggest it was around 1 to 2 metres across. \u201cImpacts of this size can be considered completely harmless. They typically create so-called \u2018airbursts\u2019 at altitudes of about 40 kilometres above ground,\u201d says Richard Moissl at the European Space Agency\u2019s Planetary Defence Office. A signature of the disintegrating asteroid was picked up by infrasound monitoring stations that listen out for pressure waves from nuclear weapons tests. Peter Brown at Western University in Ontario, Canada, who is an expert at interpreting such data, tweeted that the energy released by the detonating space rock could have been equivalent to around 2 kilotons of TNT. Moissl says events like these allow astronomers to make measurements that can shed light on characteristics such as an object\u2019s density or composition. \u201cWith only optical observations of asteroids passing by Earth, we might never know more about their physical properties. But if a previously tracked object is also observed during its atmospheric entry and break-up, we can learn more about these quantities,\u201d he says. Impacts can also give modellers like Boslough a chance to test how well their simulations describe reality. \u201c2022 EB5 was an experiment that nature provided for us,\u201d says Boslough. \u201cThe more confidence we have in our models, the better we do our jobs at assessing impact risk for planetary defence.\u201d Sign up to our free Launchpad newsletter for a voyage across the galaxy and beyond, every Friday We clarified where the asteroid was first detected.

        "text": "When health issues become polarised it's often hard to know where the truth lies, regardless of new evidence By Clare Wilson  Hello, and welcome to this week\u2019s Health Check, the weekly newsletter that gives you the health and fitness news you can really trust. To receive this free, weekly newsletter in your inbox,\u00a0sign up here. Last week, one of my stories was on whether vaping is helpful or harmful in reducing smoking rates. It was based on research looking at whether vaping encourages teenagers to start smoking cigarettes. The study found that, contrary to fears, vaping\u00a0probably doesn\u2019t act as a gateway to smoking. In England, as vaping rates among teens have jumped up, tobacco smoking hasn\u2019t followed the same trend. While teens who vape are more likely to end up as smokers, this is probably because those who try out vaping are the same people who would have ended up smoking, regardless. It could be because these are the teens innately drawn to experimentation and rule-breaking, or perhaps they are copying family members who also vape or smoke. When covering new research, the usual approach at\u00a0New Scientist\u00a0and other respected news sources is to show the paper to other scientists to get their take on it and, if we have space, to include a comment from them in the story. We try to find people who are experts in the field but weren\u2019t involved in the research, so they will be impartial. But vaping is one of those topics where I usually have a good idea of what my chosen expert will have to say about any new study. Opinions on e-cigarettes have become so polarised that most researchers and public health doctors either say they are wonderful because they help people quit smoking or terrible because they just get people stuck on a different nicotine habit.  This is a topic I\u00a0first wrote about two decades ago. In fact, it was my first ever story for\u00a0New Scientist,\u00a0and it helped me get a permanent job with the magazine. Even then, when the idea of safer cigarettes was new, tobacco researchers were starting to divide along ideological lines. The UK is an outlier on this issue. As vaping became more popular, some leading figures in Public Health England took the view that although it carries some health risks, vaping isn\u2019t nearly as harmful as inhaling the cancer-causing chemicals in ordinary tobacco smoke. As a result, UK laws around e-cigarettes are relatively lenient and doctors advise smokers that if they can\u2019t quit, they should switch to vaping instead. That\u2019s not the case in most other countries, such as the US and Australia, where many doctors see vaping as a dangerous health scourge. Part of the explanation in the US is that vape manufacturers there were given relatively free rein on advertising. The manufacturer of one of the most popular vape brands, Juul, was accused of marketing its products to teenagers, although the firm eventually settled the case without admitting wrongdoing. The US now has higher numbers of high-school students who regularly vape, at about 11 per cent, compared with around 5 per cent in the UK, although surveys are hard to compare as they don\u2019t use the same wording. There was also a recent US\u00a0health scare\u00a0over some cases of serious lung damage from vaping, although this later turned out to be caused by a black-market cannabis vaping liquid that was bulked out with a harmful substance. The split of opinion on vaping in the medical community is, in some respects, helpful for journalists like me if we need to portray a diversity of opinions about a study\u2019s results. I can make sure my article looks \u201cbalanced\u201d. But it does make it hard to know where the truth lies if everyone has fixed positions, regardless of any new evidence. I have similar concerns any time I write about covid-19, an area that has also become extremely polarised, as no one can have escaped noticing. Opinions divide between\u00a0the more covid-cautious, who argue for tighter restrictions against the virus, to those who want an end to precautions. Iceland has just flipped from one side to the other. Having aggressively suppressed the virus for the past two years, the country stopped all legal restrictions two weeks ago. The country\u2019s health ministry even said that Iceland was trying to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d through both infection and vaccination. When I interviewed an Icelandic public health chief, it became clear that the plan isn\u2019t as radical as it sounds, as the Icelandic government isn\u2019t using the term herd immunity in the same way as the UK does. But the country\u2019s public health body really does believe that most people will need to get infected with omicron as a way out of the pandemic. I wanted to give a balanced analysis of Iceland\u2019s strategy, but, as with vaping, I could almost have predicted what every expert I spoke to was going to say before I rang them up. I wonder if all of us \u2013 myself included \u2013 can get locked into our opinions on certain topics. Anyway, the story is\u00a0here,\u00a0so you can decide for yourself on Iceland\u2019s policy. \u00a0  \u00a0 Some villages in the Cappadocia region of Turkey have a dark secret. Their inhabitants are plagued by a particularly nasty form of lung cancer called mesothelioma. \u201cWhen we wake up, we see if we\u2019ve got a cough, because whoever coughs is considered ready to die,\u201d one of the villagers said. \u201cIf we see somebody cough when they\u2019re walking in the street, everybody looks at them and thinks they will be next.\u201d This cancer usually occurs in people who have been exposed to asbestos, yet that isn\u2019t the case here. For four decades, scientists and doctors have been trying to solve this puzzle. Read\u00a0about how the work has revealed a new source of cancer risk that could affect people around the globe.

In a small trial, even one night spent sleeping in a room with a light on was enough to give participants slightly worse blood sugar control the next morning. Previous population studies have found that people who sleep with a light on or the TV on in their bedrooms are more likely to be overweight or have type 2 diabetes. But such research can\u2019t say if it is the light that causes the poor health. Now, the study by Phyllis Zee at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago and her colleagues supports the idea that the connection is causal, and gives clues about the possible mechanism. Her team investigated the link by asking 20 healthy volunteers to spend two nights in their sleep lab. On the first night, all participants slept in a very dark room. On the second, half slept with a lighting level of 100 lux, equivalent to keeping a TV or bedside light on or having a bright street light shining through thin curtains. On both mornings, Zee\u2019s team investigated all the volunteers\u2019 blood sugar control using two common tests involving insulin, the main hormone involved in regulating glucose levels. One measure combined glucose and insulin levels after waking up, and the other involved giving people a dose of glucose and measuring their insulin response. People who slept in the dimly lit room on their second night had slightly worse blood sugar control than on their first night, when the room was nearly dark. \u201cThey thought they slept well, but your brain knows that the lights are on,\u201d says Zee. People who had two nights under dark conditions had little difference in their blood sugar control. However, people shouldn\u2019t assume that they need to change their sleeping habits unless the results are borne out in a larger trial, says Jim Horne, who until recently ran a sleep lab at Loughborough University in the UK. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that by turning your TV off people are going to lose weight.\u201d Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2113290119 Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2113290119 More on these topics:  \n                                        Magazine issue\n                                        \n                                            3378\n                                        \n                                        , published 19 March 2022\n                                     Previous article \n                                                Cutting biofuels can help avoid global food shock from Ukraine war\n                                             Next article \n                                                We may now know why young blood can have rejuvenating effects\n                                            "

        "text": "Babies whose mothers were vaccinated against respiratory syncytial virus had less need for drugs against bacterial infections By Clare Wilson A mother and babyProstock-studio / Alamy A mother and baby Prostock-studio / Alamy A vaccine against a virus that causes chest infections in young babies has an unexpected effect \u2013 it cuts the number of antibiotics given to treat bacterial infections. The results, from a large trial of a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), suggest the jab could help reduce antibiotic resistance, says Joseph Lewnard at the University of California, Berkeley. RSV is a common cause of colds in children. Some who catch it when very young develop severe chest infections, so several firms are working on vaccines, given either to babies or pregnant people. The latter works because antibodies cross the placenta to reach the fetus in the uterus. Resvax is an experimental vaccine designed for use in pregnancy developed by US biotech firm Novavax. In 2019, the company reported results from a large randomised trial that found it reduced RSV infections in babies, but not by enough to meet its objectives. But Lewnard\u2019s team wondered if the trial would show any effects on antibiotic use. These medicines don\u2019t work against viruses \u2013 they only treat bacterial infections \u2013 but doctors may prescribe them if they don\u2019t know the cause of an infection. Also, RSV can sometimes lead to secondary infections by bacteria. The trial recruited about 4500 pregnant women in 11 countries and gave two-thirds of them the RSV vaccine, while the rest got a placebo injection. Babies whose mothers got the RSV jab received 13 per cent less antibiotics in their first three months of life, mainly for pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections. This suggests that if any of the other RSV vaccines in development reach the clinic, they may cut antibiotic use and so reduce antibiotic resistance, says Lewnard. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of data to show that we have too much antibiotic resistance in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cAntibiotic resistance is a growing problem in terms of the burden of disease and death.\u201d Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2112410119 Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2112410119 Sign up to our free Health Check newsletter for a round-up of all the health and fitness news you need to know, every Saturday More on these topics: "

        "text": "The US and Europe can compensate for the loss of Ukraine\u2019s grain exports by scrapping biofuel mandates, helping to avoid a food price shock By Michael Le Page A wheat field in UkraineMaksym Belchenko/Getty Images A wheat field in Ukraine Maksym Belchenko/Getty Images The war in Ukraine has already caused food prices to shoot up as global markets anticipate a loss of wheat and maize exports from one of the world\u2019s largest producers of these crops. But Europe and the US could more than compensate for the loss of Ukraine\u2019s exports by diverting crops destined to be made into biofuels into food production instead.\u00a0This would bring food prices down and help prevent a major global food shock. On 9 March, Ukraine banned most food exports to try to ensure that its people don\u2019t go hungry as Russian forces invade. Food prices were already at the highest levels for 40 years, says Matin Qaim at the University of Bonn in Germany. This is for many reasons, including poor harvests because of extreme weather driven by global warming. Quickly increasing the supply of food crops is difficult. But a large proportion of food crops aren\u2019t eaten but converted to biofuels. Globally, 10 per cent of all grain is turned into biofuel, says Qaim. In the US, a third of the maize grown is converted into ethanol and blended into petrol. Around 90 million tonnes is used for ethanol, nearly double the 50 million tonnes exported by Ukraine and Russia, says Qaim. In the European Union, 12 million tonnes of grain, including wheat and maize, is turned into ethanol, Qaim says, around 7 per cent of the bloc\u2019s production. The EU also produces large quantities of biodiesel. It turns 3.5 million tonnes of palm oil alone into biodiesel, says Qaim. \u201cThat\u2019s almost the amount of sunflower oil coming out of Ukraine and Russia.\u201d Governments have the power to change this, says Ariel Brunner at Birdlife International. \u201cBecause the biofuel market is entirely driven by subsidies, you can unplug it literally with the stroke of a pen,\u201d he says. If the US and Europe were to decrease their use of ethanol made from grain by 50 per cent, they would effectively replace all of Ukraine\u2019s exports of grain, Tim Searchinger at Princeton University has calculated in response to a question from New Scientist. \u201cThis is one of the few really quick things we can do,\u201d says Brunner. \u201cWe are literally burning a hell of a lot of food.\u201d One country has already done just this. On 11 March, the Czech Republic ended its mandate requiring ethanol to be blended with petrol. It did this to reduce the costs of fuel rather than food, but Brunner is calling for other countries to follow suit. \u201cIt absolutely would make a difference. It would begin to relieve prices immediately.\u201d says Jason Hill at the University of Minnesota in St Paul. \u201cIt would also send a signal that can be acted on immediately by farmers. Northern hemisphere farmers are deciding now what to plant.\u201d The US Environmental Protection Agency has the power to waive the requirement to blend ethanol into fuels, says Hill. \u201cThe EPA could very quickly send a signal that ethanol is not needed.\u201d Temporarily halting biofuel mandates wouldn\u2019t be popular with farmers. The powerful agrobusiness lobby in the US is currently demanding the opposite, that biofuel production is increased in response to the rising oil price, says Hill. However, only 6 per cent of fuel sold at petrol pumps in the US is ethanol, he says, so changing this either way isn\u2019t going to have a major effect on global oil prices. By contrast, it could have a major effect on food prices. Higher food prices hit those with the lowest incomes the hardest, and can contribute to political unrest such as the 2011 Arab Spring. \u201cHunger may go up significantly,\u201d says Qaim. \u201cIt\u2019s profoundly immoral to try to solve a shortage of energy by creating a shortage of food,\u201d says Brunner. In general, fuel price rises affect those who can afford to drive cars and fly, whereas people with low incomes spend most of their money on food, he says. \u201cYou are taking food off the table of people in the slums of Cairo to subsidise rich people driving SUVs.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a question of what you care about most,\u201d says Searchinger. Some proponents of bioenergy have argued that it provides a buffer that could be removed during food shortages, he says, and now is the time to use it. \u201cEven that signal of increased availability is going to have a disproportionately beneficial effect on prices,\u201d says Hill. \u201cYou are going to reduce the potential for catastrophically large market responses.\u201d Many researchers have long been calling for a permanent end to biofuel mandates, because study after study has shown they don\u2019t reduce greenhouse gas emissions by much if at all and in fact often increase them. Charities such as Oxfam have campaigned against biofuels, saying that by increasing demand, they have pushed up food prices globally and pushed more people into poverty. Higher demand has also led to more land clearance and habitat loss for wildlife, the main factor driving the loss of biodiversity. \u201cThere\u2019s growing recognition of the negative repercussions of using food for fuel,\u201d says Hill.

        "text": "We had calculated that frozen peatlands would remain stable until the 2070s, but a new analysis suggests they may begin thawing as early as the 2040s By Adam Vaughan Scandinavian mountain range, above the Arctic Circle in northern SwedenJONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP via Getty Images Scandinavian mountain range, above the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP via Getty Images Vast expanses of peatland in frozen soil across northern Europe are expected to pass a climatic tipping point far sooner than previously thought, threatening to release billions of tonnes of carbon that would accelerate climate change. Global warming has already caused Arctic permafrost to start releasing more carbon than it absorbs. But Richard Fewster at the University of Leeds, UK, and his colleagues have pinpointed in new detail when and where local climates will become unsuitable for peatland locked away in permafrost. Finland, Norway, Sweden and a small part of north-west Russia will become too warm for permafrost peatland by the 2040s in all possible future carbon emissions scenarios considered by the team, compared with 2070 as thought previously. In the three higher-emission scenarios, most of Western Siberia will pass the same threshold in the 2090s. This would leave 39.5 billion tonnes of carbon, twice the amount contained in Europe\u2019s forests, at risk of being released into the atmosphere and turbocharging climate change. The vast majority of that carbon is locked up in western Siberia, which has much older and larger peatlands than the other areas included in the study. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a huge carbon store that\u2019s undergoing rapid changes. A huge amount of this carbon could be released into the atmosphere,\u201d says Fewster. However, he cautions against fatalism and says a key message is the importance of the choices countries make today to tackle climate change. Under the lowest-emission scenario, about 14 billion tonnes of carbon could still survive in the far north of Western Siberia. In the higher-emission scenarios, this will eventually be released. Fewster and his colleagues arrived at their findings after building a baseline of suitable climates for permafrost peatland stores across a region of northern Eurasia, leaving out places such as Eastern Siberia where detailed maps of peatland are patchy. They then used state-of-the-art climate models to project how long areas would remain cool enough to support frozen peatlands. One caveat is that it remains unclear how long the carbon in the frozen soils will take to reach the atmosphere once climatic tipping points are reached. In places where it has already become too warm, observations show permafrost can sometimes thaw quickly in two years, but in other cases can take a decade, says Fewster. Getting a better handle on that rate will be the subject of future research. \u201cPeatlands are the most important terrestrial store of carbon on the planet, and if, as this research suggests, we risk seeing a significant proportion of them turn from sinks to sources of carbon, we are in real trouble,\u201d says Christian Dunn at Bangor University, UK, who calls the study \u201cdepressingly fascinating\u201d.

        "text": "Shutterstock/Romolo Tavani SOMETIMES it pays to take the long view. Look at the past half-century of cosmology, as UK Astronomer Royal Martin Rees does in our interview, and it is plain how far we have come. The story of the universe\u2019s origin in a big bang \u2013 an idea not especially favoured when Rees started as a researcher in the 1960s \u2013 is now as close to an established fact as science permits. We have also elucidated the properties and phenomena of an unimaginably vast cosmos with ever more acuity. It is a privilege to live in an age when, for the first time, we have a convincing story of most of the grand sweep of cosmic evolution. \u201cIf so many planets are out there, how come intelligent life hasn\u2019t come our way?\u201d These are truly thrilling developments, albeit ones that have, in the nature of science, thrown up more holes in our understanding \u2013 holes that instruments such as the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope are designed to plug. Yet this progress also gives reason for introspection. Many researchers like Rees find themselves drawn to questions of humanity\u2019s future. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets circling other stars, and the realisation that even icy moons in the outer solar system might harbour warm and wet environments, boosts the belief that if life exists on one tiny blue dot, it might exist elsewhere, too. So why hasn\u2019t intelligent life elsewhere made itself known to us? Perhaps because hubristic missteps give technological civilisations a limited lifespan \u2013 and perhaps also because, as we have learned, space is an unforgiving environment. It is a half-century now since the last person walked on the moon and, as Rees warns, while billionaires such as Elon Musk battle it out to return there, it is folly to think \u201cspace tourism\u201d will ever be the norm for our species. Any vestiges of humanity that leave our solar system will probably be very different to us, and most likely the progeny of the pioneers who establish a future beyond Earth, on Mars for example. For the rest of us, our planet is all there is. The problems we face, not least the tragedy currently unfolding in Ukraine, are a reminder that progress can just as easily be undone. All the more reason to apply our common humanity to solving the problems of the here and now. \n                                        Magazine issue\n                                        \n                                            3377\n                                        \n                                        , published 12 March 2022\n                                     Next article \n                                                Why has the omicron coronavirus variant hit Hong Kong so hard?\n                                            "

Our skin becomes noticeably looser, grey hairs more numerous and, of course, our clothes typically start to feel a bit tighter \u2013 especially around the waist. The last of these is known as middle-aged spread, the commonly accepted idea that we start to pack on the pounds around the abdomen as we get older. This excess weight is said to be easy to put on and harder to shift than when we were younger, the thinking being that our once-perky metabolism gets sluggish with age. We can no longer get away with as much, and our efforts to ditch the belly with diet or exercise become a losing battle. So far, so miserable. But then, last July, a study of over 6000 people around the world blew the idea out of the water. It showed that metabolism stays remarkably stable as we age, at least until our 60s. \u201cThe amount of calories you burn per day from age 20 to 60 remains about the same,\u201d says Herman Pontzer at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that you have much less control over metabolism than we thought.\u201d The idea that your metabolism is just as active as you approach your 60s as it was in your 20s should be welcome news for anyone nearing middle age \u2013 usually defined as the period from 45 to 65 years of age \u2013 and facing the dreaded spread.

Three new science-fiction books, released this month, challenge this view, showing that maps are more than the objective depictions we take them to be. In The Cartographers, Peng Shepherd\u2019s latest work of magical realist speculative fiction, the characters have a habit of asking \u201cwhat makes a map?\u201d. The answer, it becomes clear, is its purpose. From political maps to resource maps and road maps, the main purpose of cartography is to create a shared version of reality: one that suits the map-maker\u2019s ideals. Shepherd\u2019s protagonist, a young cartographer named Nell, finds this out to her cost when she inherits a mysterious map after the death of her estranged father. The power of maps to make visible what the map-makers want you to see, and to hide what they would rather you didn\u2019t, is revealed when Nell discovers a shady cartel that has killed a lot of people to keep this particular map secret. First and foremost, The Cartographers is a love letter to maps and the secrets they hide. It is also a Luddite\u2019s cri du coeur against Google and other tech giants, whose maps are stripped of cultural and historical perspective. As speculative fiction, it works well, but the book also drifts into vignettes about dramas between student cartographers in an academic hothouse that recall scenes from Donna Tartt\u2019s The Secret History. The book ultimately sags under the weight of so many competing ambitions, but overall, the plot is strong enough to carry you through to the end. \u201cIf maps shape our expectations of reality, what happens when reality contradicts those expectations?\u201d If maps shape our expectations of reality, what happens when reality contradicts those expectations? Lucy Kissick explores this in Plutoshine, which follows the quest to terraform Pluto into a habitable water world for humans. This requires some suspension of disbelief given that the ambient temperature is -240\u00b0C, methanol and nitrogen freeze solid and it isn\u2019t easy to pick out the sun in the murky \u201cdaytime\u201d sky. It is undeniably science fiction, but there is a heavy emphasis on science. From astrophysics to cosmochemistry, there is a lot to learn, including about the various isotopes of hydrogen. Science lessons aside, Plutoshine is worth the admission fee for the fantastical depictions of Pluto alone, with its jewelled ice slopes in a rainbow of different colours of frozen elements. And also for the point at which it transpires that mapping technology missed what is hiding under all that ice. What drives us to map such wild, uncharted terrain at all is the central question of Sweep of Stars, Maurice Broaddus\u2019s beautiful new Afrofuturist vision. In Broaddus\u2019s world, space exploration is driven not by the whims of billionaires, but by people who have been pushed to create empires where others fear to tread. The Muungano Empire is the diaspora of Black people on Earth who fled to escape their oppressors. The elders must chart their expansion while keeping their peoples\u2019 histories alive. Not easy, when they are pursued by their enemies, who spout the eerily-familiar motto: \u201cEarth first\u201d. Broaddus\u2019s characters are as captivating as those in Game of Thrones, and the story is as big as Isaac Asimov\u2019s Foundation series. All three books provide a timely reminder not only to look more closely at maps, but to question who created them and why.

Some of the largest solar farms in the world are in deserts, such as Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in the United Arab Emirates and Desert Sunlight Solar Farm in California. These environments tend to be very dusty, with particles quickly accumulating on solar panels. One month\u2019s dust build-up can cut a solar panel\u2019s output by around 40 per cent. One of the most common ways of removing this dust is to spray large amounts of distilled water onto the solar panels. With an estimated 45 billion litres of water being used every year just to clean solar panels, the process is costly and unsustainable, says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThat amount could provide water for over a million people [every year],\u201d he says. To help solve this issue, Varanasi and his colleagues created a water-free way of cleaning solar panels via static electricity in the laboratory. Dust doesn\u2019t ordinarily conduct electricity. This changes, however, when moisture in the air attaches onto the surface of a dust particle \u2013 a process known as adsorption. The thin glass sheets that cover solar panels also aren\u2019t conductors. To change this, Varanasi\u2019s team added a 5-nanometre layer of transparent zinc oxide and aluminium to a solar panel\u2019s surface. A metallic plate was then hovered above the dust-covered panel, and an electric field of around 12 kilovolts was applied between the plate and the panel. This caused both layers to become electrodes, conductors that make contact with a non-metallic part of a circuit. The solar panel and dust then became positively charged, while the metallic plate became negatively charged. As the plate swept above the panel, dust particles started to repel each other, causing them to disperse. At around 30 per cent relative humidity, the dust particles adsorbed enough moisture to be completely removed from the solar panel in the laboratory, restoring 95 per cent of its lost power output. Even the driest deserts have a relative humidity of about 30 per cent, says Varanasi. \u201cI think water is a precious commodity that is very undervalued,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is this will spur more people to think about water issues.\u201d Journal reference: Science Advances, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abm0078 Journal reference: Science Advances, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abm0078 More on these topics: "

Our knowledge of how wind damages trees has been limited by a lack of real-world experiments using the wind speeds seen in destructive cyclones. Kana Kamimura at Shinshu University in Japan and her colleagues were monitoring two different plots of Japanese cedar trees, one of which had been thinned to assess whether giving individual trees more room to grow made them more vulnerable to wind damage, when typhoon Trami unexpectedly hit in early September 2018. \u201cI set the plot in 2017 and the typhoon came in 2018, and half of my plot was destroyed,\u201d says Kamimura. \u201cSo the [study] is kind of lucky, but also kind of unlucky.\u201d Kamimura and her team measured the stress forces experienced by the trees before, during and after the typhoon, and surveyed the resulting damage. The plot that hadn\u2019t been thinned kept all of its trees, while the sparser plot lost many. The researchers think that the tight spacing helped protect the trees in the plot that wasn\u2019t thinned by dissipating the force from the wind through collisions between branches of neighbouring trees. This stopped the force travelling into the sensitive stem and roots below, where it might help uproot trees. They also found that the trees that did fall in the thinned plot didn\u2019t fail instantly but over time, like a piece of metal that\u2019s repeatedly been bent back and forth before finally breaking. Understanding how far apart to space trees in plantations could be important for the timber industry, and for efforts to plant forests for carbon offsetting. \u201cIf you\u2019re in an area which has a high risk of wind damage, you really want to manage your forest in a different way,\u201d says Barry Gardiner at the European Institute of Planted Forest in France, who was one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cEven though specific to this Japanese coniferous plantation, I think there\u2019s wider relevance there about how to manage woodlands at a time of climate change and increased extreme wind events,\u201d says Yadvinder Malhi at the University of Oxford, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. It will be important to conduct more experiments with different amounts of thinning, says Kamimura. \u201cIf we can find a method for how many trees we should remove, it will be very helpful for foresters managing forests.\u201d Journal reference: Science Advances, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abm7891 Journal reference: Science Advances, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abm7891 \u00a0 More on these topics: "

But the evolutionary biologist in me is more sanguine. The process of evolution continues unabated. If anything, humans have caused it to speed up. Look closely enough and you can see a new world evolving around us. Witness it in the London Underground, where, beside the rumbling trains, a new species of mosquito is in the midst of an evolutionary flowering. And it is far from alone. For centuries, evolutionary processes were thought to happen at a glacial pace compared with the speed of daily experience. However, over the past decades we have come to realise that evolution can in fact occur very quickly, even within days, as the virus that causes covid-19 has demonstrated. As I argue in my book, A Natural History of the Future, this evolution is occurring disproportionately fast in our cities. These urban landscapes might seem a far cry from the Galapagos Islands and the other wild places where the rules of evolution were first uncovered, but no amount of environmental tinkering or destruction by humans can rewrite the rules of nature. And by considering the laws of evolution, we can make predictions about the kinds of new species that will emerge via the radical biological change taking place, mostly unnoticed, right under our noses.

        "text": "Will gas power stations equipped with carbon capture and storage be the future of power plants in the UK? By Adam Vaughan Keadby 2 gas-fired power stationDavid Soulsby / Alamy Keadby 2 gas-fired power station David Soulsby / Alamy This is Fix the Planet, the weekly climate change newsletter that reminds you there are reasons for hope in science and technology around the world. To receive it in your inbox,\u00a0sign up here. What does the power station of the future look like to you? Fleets of wind turbines and rows of solar panels might spring to mind. In the UK, it\u2019s increasingly clear that offshore wind farms are going to be the backbone of the country\u2019s energy system because of economics, emissions and the ecosystem of companies supplying them here. Alongside those, we\u2019re going to need a lot more energy storage, more power links to other countries and more energy efficiency. But it\u2019s also a realistic possibility that we\u2019re going to need other power stations that can be fired up at will for when we have mini wind droughts or spikes in demand. I took the train up to Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire last week to meet Alistair Phillips-Davies, the chief executive of energy giant SSE, and hear about his plans to build the world\u2019s first hydrogen power station and another potential first, a gas power plant equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS). I travelled to the incredibly flat landscape that is home to Keadby 2, an 893-megawatt gas power station in east England that SSE has virtually finished.\u00a0It will almost certainly be the UK\u2019s last gas power station without CCS. Looking out from the roof of its cooling towers, however, you can see two fields that SSE hopes to turn into Keadby 3. If it gets built and comes online towards the end of this decade, it would be the world\u2019s first gas power station with CCS (it faces competition for the title from another project,\u00a0at Peterhead in Scotland). In theory, it should capture about 95 per cent of the plant\u2019s carbon dioxide, says Phillips-Davies. Exhaust gases from the plant will be run through a liquid, sucking up the CO2, before it\u2019s compressed and transported through a pipeline that doesn\u2019t exist yet. That will whisk the carbon dioxide away for storage in an old oil and gas reservoir under the seabed. Again, such a facility needs to be built. With coal, yes. It didn\u2019t work out well. There were some small-scale pilots in the UK, including\u00a0one at Ferrybridge, a now-closed coal plant that isn\u2019t a million miles from Keadby. There is one large-scale coal power station with CCS operating in Canada,\u00a0but it hasn\u2019t performed as well as hoped. There appears little appetite globally for further coal power with CCS. But Phillips-Davies thinks gas plants with CCS would be different and could be a cornerstone of meeting the UK government\u2019s\u00a0goal of a fully decarbonised power system by 2035. He concedes gas prices are \u201cvery unusual\u201d at the moment (read: record highs), but doesn\u2019t think that undermines the case for his vision. Phillips-Davies says millions of pounds have already been spent and notes that SSE has earmarked \u201chundreds of millions\u201d for future CCS and hydrogen projects. The planning process has already started (SSE was holding a meeting with local people 10 minutes away on the day I visited, and\u00a0an initial consultation closes on 20 March). But until a final investment decision is made, it remains a proposal rather than a firm bet. Richard Howard at analysts Aurora Energy Research says the power station would clearly need some form of new government support to make it happen. Next to the fields where Keadby 3 might sit are car parks and cabins that could be moved to make way for Keadby Hydrogen. It would be the world\u2019s first large hydrogen power station, if completed this decade as hoped by SSE and its partner, the Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor. To date, most uses of hydrogen for electricity generation have been small scale and involved fuel cells in buildings, rather than burning the stuff to power turbines. The proposed new power station would arguably be even more ambitious than the CCS gas one, because no one has tried anything like this before. \u201cOn paper it sounds great,\u201d says Jess Ralston at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based think tank. You\u2019re one step ahead.\u00a0Almost all of the world\u2019s hydrogen today is made from fossil fuels, producing carbon emissions equivalent to those of the UK and Indonesia together each year. So the new plant will need to be fuelled with green hydrogen (made using renewable electricity and electrolysers) or blue hydrogen (reformed from natural gas with the CO2 captured and stored). Equinor is planning a blue hydrogen plant just up the road from Keadby Hydrogen, at\u00a0a project called H2H Saltend. Phillips-Davies says he thinks some blue hydrogen is the \u201cright way to start\u201d, to have enough volumes available and because it\u2019s likely to be cheaper than green hydrogen. However, he says: \u201cUltimately, I think you want to get to green. When we build more and more of our big wind farms offshore, I suspect then we\u2019ll get into green hydrogen. We\u2019re doing a lot of work on what size an electrolyser fleet can SSE own by the end of this.\u201d For now, he says low-carbon hydrogen consumption and production simply needs to get going. \u201cThe hydrogen journey is just starting.\u201d If you enjoy Fix the Planet, please do recommend it to your friends, family and colleagues \u2013 \u00a0they can sign up here.

The images are taken from the book Leonhart Fuchs: The New Herbal by historian Werner Dressend\u00f6rfer and published by Taschen. It is based on Fuchs\u2019s original catalogue of about 500 herbal plants and their properties. Leonhart Fuchs Fuchs\u2019s work, De Historia Stirpium, released in 1543, was based on previous botanical knowledge and his own research. It is widely recognised for the accuracy and high quality of Fuchs\u2019s illustrations, a selection of which are shown here. First is garden balsam (Impatiens balsamina), a native of Asia historically used to treat skin ailments, such as burns (with the flowers) and warts (the leaves). Leonhart Fuchs The following four images show: a variety of Cucurbita pepo, a group of vegetables high in antioxidants and other beneficial molecules. Other varieties are cultivated to produce crops including pumpkins and courgettes. Leonhart Fuchs Next is a pasque flower (Pulsatilla vulgaris), which contains the medically active compound anemonin. Bottom right is mandrake (Mandragora), once used in Europe as a laxative, ointment and alleged aphrodisiac, among other applications.

        "text": "Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s streaming debut is touching, yet somewhat lacking in mystery and suspense By Jon O'Brien Ptolemy Grey (Samuel L. Jackson) has advanced dementia, but a new drug changes everythingHopper Stone/Apple TV+ Ptolemy Grey (Samuel L. Jackson) has advanced dementia, but a new drug changes everything Hopper Stone/Apple TV+ The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey Walter Mosley Apple TV+ \u201cI GOT to set things right,\u201d says Ptolemy Grey, Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s latest screen incarnation. He talks into a tape recorder while loading a bullet intended for the man banging on his apartment door. \u201cThat motherfucker got to pay for what he\u2019s done.\u201d The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey\u2018s opening scene could have been lifted from a belated Pulp Fiction spin-off, revisiting Jackson\u2019s foul-mouthed, fast-food-obsessed, gun-toting hitman Jules Winnfield nearly three decades on. Then the action flashes back to just two months earlier. Now we see Ptolemy as a dishevelled, confused 93-year-old living on tinned sausages and beans in a cockroach-infested flat. Regular visits from his kindly great-nephew Reggie (Omar Benson Miller) are his only respite. This six-part drama, adapted by Walter Mosley from his 2010 novel of the same name, begins by painting a heartbreakingly convincing picture of a man with his mundane daily routines are interspersed with visions of his beloved late wife and often horrifying flashbacks from his childhood in the Deep South. The story takes a turn for the fantastical when Ptolemy discovers he is eligible for a new drug trial that will restore his memories in crystal-clear detail. The catch is that it is a temporary fix and will worsen his condition in the long run. Despite this obvious drawback, Ptolemy jumps at the chance to sign up, having discovered that what he thought was a birthday party was actually Reggie\u2019s funeral. He needs his mind back to find out who is responsible for Reggie\u2019s death. It is an intriguing set-up, but one that Mosley fails to capitalise on. Ptolemy\u2019s amateur sleuthing isn\u2019t engaging, and the culprit is eventually revealed so casually that it barely registers. A gripping whodunnit this isn\u2019t, perhaps surprisingly considering that Mosley built his reputation on his novels about the hard-boiled detective Easy Rawlins. The series works much better as a meditation on memories, consciousness and the passing of time. Ptolemy enjoys learning how things like hip-hop and the internet have progressed during his cognitive decline. But as he tells Dr. Rubin (Walton Goggins), who is running the drug trial, some things are forgotten for a reason. Remembering elements of his traumatic childhood under racial segregation solves a few mysteries, but also increases his night terrors. And as Ptolemy gets closer to the truth about his great-nephew, he finds it harder to control the reactions that would have stayed buried with his memories. Jackson, giving his first on-screen lead performance in TV\u2019s new golden age, appears to relish flexing his acting muscles a little harder than he has of late. Through some impressive ageing and de-ageing make-up, he gets to portray Ptolemy across a half-century of his life, giving his character\u2019s shifts between degeneration and regeneration an emotional resonance that has been lacking in some of his recent big-screen work. Fresh from her BAFTA-nominated role in Judas and the Black Messiah, Dominique Fishback also impresses as teenage orphan Robyn, the only other member of Ptolemy\u2019s circle who sees him as a person rather than an inconvenience. Their touching, platonic relationship is far more engaging than any of the several romantic subplots. But even this strong central pairing isn\u2019t quite enough to compensate for an unfocused and underwhelming narrative. Ironically, for a drama about the power of memory, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey is unlikely to leave a lasting impression.

        "text": "DNA sequencing has revealed that a bright pink lake on an island off Western Australia gets its colour from a mix of salt-loving bacteria and algae By Alice Klein Aerial view of Lake Hillier, AustraliaTourism Western Australia Aerial view of Lake Hillier, Australia Tourism Western Australia The unusual bubblegum pink colour of a remote lake in Western Australia has long been a mystery, but new research suggests it is caused by a mix of colourful bacteria and algae. Lake Hillier is located on Middle Island off the southern coast of Western Australia. The lake is 600 metres long, 250 metres wide and extremely salty \u2013 about eight times saltier than the ocean. Scott Tighe at the University of Vermont in Burlington became interested in Lake Hillier after seeing it on a television programme. \u201cI thought, that\u2019s amazing. I\u2019ve got to get over there and grab samples and sequence the heck out of it,\u201d he says. Tighe is a co-founder of the Extreme Microbiome Project (XMP), an international collaboration seeking to genetically profile extreme environments around the world to discover new and interesting microbes. He teamed up with Ken McGrath at Microba, a microbial genomics company in Brisbane, Australia, who visited Lake Hillier to collect water and sediment samples. Tighe, McGrath and their colleagues analysed the samples using a technique called metagenomics, which sequences all the DNA in an environmental sample at once. Powerful computers then tease out the genomes of individual microbes. Their analysis revealed that Lake Hillier contains almost 500 extremophiles \u2013 organisms that thrive in extreme environments \u2013 including bacteria, archaea, algae and viruses. Most were halophiles, a sub-group of extremophiles that can tolerate high levels of salt. Several of these halophiles were colourful microbes like purple sulphur bacteria; Salinibacter ruber, which are red-orange bacteria; and red-coloured algae called Dunaliella salina. The mix of these microbes, and possibly others, explains the pink colour of the lake, says Tighe. The reason why these microbes are coloured may be that the purple, red and orange pigments they contain \u2013 known as carotenoids \u2013 provide some protection against extreme saltiness, says Tighe. Some of the microbes discovered in Lake Hillier appear to be new to science, but they still need to be fully characterised, he says. XMP scientists have also sampled other extreme environments, such as Darvaza gas crater in Turkmenistan, also known as the \u201cDoor to Hell\u201d; the Dry valleys of Antarctica; brine lakes that are 3.5 kilometres under the ocean off western Greenland; and Movile cave in Romania. The team is now planning to sample the Danakil depression in Ethiopia, which contains toxic hot springs, and Lake Magic in Australia, which is \u201cso acidic it\u2019s like battery acid\u201d, says Tighe.

        "text": "Feedback is our weekly column of bizarre stories, implausible advertising claims, confusing instructions and more Josie Ford Feedback can think of few more unnerving fates than coming round from one of our regular fainting fits at the dentist\u2019s in a pool not just of our own drool, but canine saliva too. Yet, \u201cDental patients at a practice in Green Bay, Wisconsin, can cuddle with a cockapoo named Charlie. In Cornelius, North Carolina, Whalen Dentistry advertises that a goldendoodle named Beamer will \u2018make any appointment a little less\u2026 RUFF!'\u201d, we read on Kaiser Health News. The spread of such patient-calming \u201csnuggle dogs\u201d seems to have divided the world into dog people and (presumably) cat people, and led North Carolina to introduce regulations allowing only \u201ccertain highly trained dogs\u201d in dental exam rooms. This makes us wonder what sort of training a dog undergoes to become a dentist\u2019s assistant. Still, we see that a pilot study from researchers at the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u03ccn in Mexico in 2019 recorded lower blood pressure spikes among a small sample of anxious dental patients when a dog (English shepherd, schnauzer, border collie or Labrador retriever) was placed on a clean towel over their legs, so there is some solid science behind it. That is more than can be said for fish. Proving there really is research for every occasion, we encounter a 2021 paper from researchers at the University of Zurich in Switzerland detailing a clinical trial looking at the effect of fish in a dental waiting room on patient stress levels. None, as it turns out. Still, slapping with a wet fish could be a good way to revive those who do pass out. And has no one really thought to try out dental cats? We can\u2019t tell you how excited we are that next week at SXSW Dolly Parton is launching an audience-centric Web3 experience to be livestreamed on the blockchain. That is mainly because about the only words we understand in that sentence are \u201cDolly Parton\u201d. Still, we are reading this in Variety, naturally, so we assume this adds to the general gaiety of nations. That is especially because the \u201cDollyverse\u201d will release an exclusive selection of official and certified NFT collectibles, including a limited series of Dolly-inspired NFT artwork. Ah yes, NFT art! This is a subject we have shown our age about before (1 May 2021). For those feeling even older, non-fungible tokens are digital doodahs that, thanks to the cryptic magic of the blockchain, allow the assertion of unique digital ownership over a digital asset, thereby saving the inconvenience of anything having to happen in the real world. As far as we can make out, Dolly Parton at least remains a physical asset \u2013 two of them as she might be the first to say \u2013 in this virtual farrago. Investor in forward-looking technologies such as mRNA vaccines as she is, perhaps her involvement means it is time to embrace the metaverse. She is no \u201cbackwoods Barbie\u201d, as she once sang, so let\u2019s not hark back to the good old days when times were bad \u2013 even if this is a gamble either way, it can\u2019t be that wrong. Etc, etc. In an interview with The Telegraph\u2019s Planet Normal podcast, Richard Dearlove, the former head of the UK\u2019s not-so-secret intelligence service, MI6, adds his voice to those original thinkers advocating that the only rational way to wean ourselves off Russian gas in the light of the Ukraine crisis is to forget net-zero targets and install a fracking well in every living room. Even if the nuclear balloon doesn\u2019t go up, we might as well cook ourselves slowly. We paraphrase, marginally, but since we learn this from one of our all-too-regular unsolicited missives from the reliably diverting Dr Benny Peiser \u2013 the Dr is important \u2013 at rebranded global warming sceptic group Net Zero Watch, we are feeling appropriately sceptical. We do recall that last year, the current head of MI6, Richard Moore \u2013 if anyone sidles up to you introducing themselves as Richard, do consider that they might be a spy \u2013 announced his agency had started \u201cgreen spying\u201d on other nations to make sure they are keeping to their climate change commitments (8 May 2021). At this rate, the UK could soon be spying on itself. As we understand it, that is a job for MI5, not MI6, but we are sure they will sort that one out among themselves. Staying on energy policy, Henry Webber wonders when it became the done thing to quote the output of power stations, solar farms and the like not in megawatts or gigawatts, but in thousands or millions of houses. Do we have a conversion factor, he asks? Several, it turns out. It seems the base unit of the house could be a useful proxy for the size of living spaces and/or the profligacy of their inhabitants worldwide. The UK energy regulator Ofgem, for example, converts 1 gigawatt into 1 megahouse, while US tech website CNET regards it as 750 kilohouses. The Australian Climate Council, meanwhile, goes for a measly 300 kilohouses (while rejoicing that this is \u201cmore than enough for Canberra and Hobart!\u201c). Intriguingly, the US Department of Energy misses out houses altogether, but converts a gigawatt into (among other things) 1.3 megahorses.

        "text": "By Lucy Cooke Simone Rotella I ONCE stole a lion\u2019s girlfriend. At the time, I was in the Masai Mara in Kenya experimenting with audio playback as a means of deciphering lion communication. This involved blasting a recording of a male lion\u2019s roar into another\u2019s territory and waiting for a response. Three lions \u2013 one female and two males \u2013 raced over to our Land Rover to investigate. The males quickly got bored when they failed to find anything that resembled a rival. The female, however, pinned the vehicle to the spot, legs akimbo, for over 2 hours. She was in oestrus and, in addition to mating with her consorts, she also wanted to mate with us. Not that this was anything special for the lioness: fertile females are known to mate 100 times with multiple males in a matter of days. I was shocked and quietly thrilled to discover her licentious nature. At university, I was taught that males, with their endless supply of sperm, are wired for promiscuity, whereas females, with their limited number of eggs, must be choosy and chaste. Didn\u2019t the lioness understand this \u201cuniversal law\u201d? My research since has exposed how sexist bias has been baked into evolutionary biology and warped our understanding of the female animal. We should remember that great scientists, even geniuses like Charles Darwin, are also people of their time. Darwin\u2019s second great theoretical masterpiece \u2013 The Descent of Man, his book containing his theory of sexual selection \u2013 cast females in the role of the Victorian housewife: coy, submissive and invariant. This theory of passivity was given an empirical lifeline in the 1940s by a British geneticist called Angus Bateman, whose legendary fruit fly mating experiment \u201cproved\u201d that females have little to gain from multiple mating, whereas males do. Bateman\u2019s paradigm seared these deterministic sexual archetypes into evolutionary lore and crowned males as the dominant drivers of change. The main trouble with this neat binomial classification is that it is wrong. Just ask the lioness. Her flagrant promiscuity is now understood to be a means of confusing paternity and protecting her offspring against the threat of infanticide by incoming males. This strategic sexuality was first discovered in langur monkeys by the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy in the 1970s, and has now been documented in dozens of species. Hrdy leads a growing army of scientists keen to look beyond such misogynistic myopia and recognise the female of the species as just as promiscuous, aggressive, competitive and varied as the male. But what is shocking is how stubborn the stain of Victorian sexism is proving to be, and how far it has spread. When Patricia Gowaty began doing DNA paternity tests on songbird eggs in 1984, she discovered that each nest frequently contained multiple fathers, despite the apparent monogamy of their parents. Members of the male ornithological establishment responded by insisting the females had been \u201craped\u201d. But radio trackers subsequently revealed females actively seeking sex with neighbouring cocks. Since then, a polyandry revolution has revealed that multiple mating is the norm for females, from lions to lizards. The reason is quite obvious: don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket \u2013 greater genetic diversity means healthier offspring. Gowaty, like me, has never tried to hide her politics. She believes in equal representation of both sexes. But, as Darwin\u2019s Victorian values show us, science is always political. A feminist perspective is urgently needed to topple centuries of androcentrism and rebrand female sexual agency, in lionesses or songbirds, from unexpected to a winning maternal strategy.

It has also generated what seem like astonishing coincidences. The pangolins of Africa and armadillos of South America, for instance, look like close cousins. In fact, each is more closely related to humans than to each other. Their similarity arises because they independently evolved near-identical strategies to cope with the same kind of environmental challenges. This is just one example of what is known as convergent evolution, but there are many others, and not all of them are so easy to spot. Take humans and birds: few readers will be immediately won over by Sydney-based zoologist Antone Martinho-Truswell\u2019s claims that we are \u201clike a strangely featherless bird\u201d, and that we have more in common with birds than with our mammalian cousins. By the time I finished The Parrot in the Mirror, though, I found that idea both compelling and reasonable. Martinho-Truswell explores the traits shared by humans and birds, from our unusual longevity to our advanced social skills, from our parenting styles to our intelligence and even the use of language. These, he argues, are all examples of convergent evolution. Briefly, his argument goes like this: once birds could fly, they could elude almost all predators. Since they were now less likely to be eaten in any given year, they could live longer and produce more offspring. With longevity came the opportunity and the need to develop increased intelligence. It is an advantage for long-living animals to be smart because it helps them to survive long enough to raise their young to adulthood. What\u2019s more, because longer development requires a bigger egg and a bigger yolk sac, and because an egg can only get so big if its mother is to fly, most birds hatch out very immature, helpless young. Chicks require enormous amounts of care, often provided by pair-bonded parents, and sometimes supplemented by a larger community. This favours the evolution of complex social behaviour and communication. Martinho-Truswell argues that the human evolutionary story is a warped mirror image of this. Our story begins, not with flight, but with communal behaviour among primates, which promoted the evolution of intelligence and social behaviour. This reduced the likelihood of predation, and longevity followed, boosting intelligence to the point where big-brained human young have to be born immature and helpless so as not to endanger their mothers\u2019 lives during childbirth. So, the argument goes, humans and birds evolved measurable intelligence in response to similar challenges. But how do we compare our abilities? In this regard, Martinho-Truswell does well to strike a balance between precision and imagination. On the one hand, a duckling\u2019s ability to identify its mother shortly after the moment of its birth puts it well ahead of chimpanzees, parrots, pigeons, crows and even human children. But this one hardwired ability doesn\u2019t necessarily make the duckling more intelligent. \u201cHumans and birds evolved intelligence in response to similar challenges. But how do we compare abilities?\u201d On the other hand, it would be a dull observer indeed that didn\u2019t see quite staggering evidence of advanced cognition in Irene Pepperberg\u2019s 30-year study of language use in Alex, an African grey parrot. The bird not only answered questions, he asked them, too. And he got annoyed if people gave him silly answers. Containing the complexities of convergent evolution in a straightforward narrative isn\u2019t easy. Evolutionary causes and effects don\u2019t follow each other in neat, storybook fashion, and there is always the temptation, reading this book, to take Martinho-Truswell\u2019s acts of narrative shorthand at face value and suppose that humans, 50 million years behind parrots in the evolution of intelligence, somehow became more human by actually mimicking their distant avian cousins. Clearly that isn\u2019t the case. But perhaps it is better to be slightly misled by a gripping story than to be bludgeoned by a dull one. Martinho-Truswell has written a superb introduction to a surprisingly complex field of study. Having read it, you won\u2019t look at yourself in the mirror in quite the same way.

The real reason for the link could be that teens who start vaping are the same ones who are likely to try smoking, regardless of whether they ever have an e-cigarette. Vaping is much less harmful for people\u2019s health than smoking, causing about 95 per cent less damage, according to an estimate by Public Health England. UK smokers are advised to switch to e-cigarettes to help them quit, but health bodies in some other countries, such as the US and Australia, take a dimmer view of vaping. A key argument against making it easy to buy e-cigarettes is that young people who start vaping will get addicted to nicotine, and so will end up switching to traditional cigarettes for the faster nicotine hit. Several studies have shown that teenagers who try vaping are more likely to end up smoking. But these studies merely observe smoking rates in individuals who have vaped and those who haven\u2019t. Such observational research can\u2019t show that the first factor causes the second, only that the two things correlate. \u201cIt could be the case that there\u2019s a common vulnerability that explains this association. That could be, for instance, because there\u2019s some genetic predisposition to try different things or there\u2019s environmental pressures to try things,\u201d says Lion Shahab at University College London. Instead of looking at whether individuals were likely to start smoking, Shahab\u2019s team looked at how the rate of smoking among 16 to 24-year-olds in England has changed over the past 11 years, as vaping caught on. If there really was a gateway effect, then, as vaping rates changed, those for smoking also should have in a related pattern. In fact, while vaping in this age group jumped to about 5 per cent in 2013 and has hovered around there since, rates of regular smoking have fallen from about 30 per cent in 2013 to 25 per cent in 2018, the last year of the study. The analysis can\u2019t rule out, however, that vaping has a very small gateway effect, says Shahab. The findings may not convince all critics of e-cigarettes. \u201cI don\u2019t see this study as refuting the extensive evidence that already exists for a gateway effect,\u201d says Martin McKee at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. \u201cFollowing up individuals is the most appropriate way to answer this question.\u201d Journal reference: Addiction, DOI: 10.1111/add.15838 Journal reference: Addiction, DOI: 10.1111/add.15838 More on these topics: "

Up to a third of these women experience recurrent infections, he says, defined as at least three UTI episodes a year. UK guidelines recommend a daily low-dose antibiotic as a preventative therapy for recurrent UTIs. However, long-term use of these drugs raises the risk of antibiotic resistance. Unlike antibiotics, which kill bacteria or prevent them from spreading, methenamine hippurate inhibits the growth of certain bacteria in urine. The antiseptic has shown promise for UTI prevention, but the evidence is inconclusive. To learn more, Harding and his colleagues studied 205 women who had on average six UTIs a year. Every day for 12 months, 102 of the participants took an antibiotic, while the remaining 103 were given a methenamine hippurate pill. Over the year, those in the antibiotic group had on average 0.89 UTI episodes, compared with 1.38 episodes among those taking methenamine hippurate. \u201cThere was basically no difference in outcomes between the two methods,\u201d says Harding. \u201cIf we want to reduce the use of antibiotics to combat antimicrobial resistance, then trials like this provide clinicians and patients a credible non-antibiotic option for prevention.\u201d However, the long-term safety of methenamine hippurate is unclear. Four of the participants who took it daily were admitted to hospital as a result of a UTI, and six of the same group reported a fever during an infection. Overall, 34 people in the antibiotic group and and 35 in the antiseptic group had side effects, most of which were mild. The study was also not blinded, so the participants and researchers were aware of the treatment received. Different antibiotics were also prescribed according to each person\u2019s medical history, which may have affected the results. Nevertheless, growing concerns around antibiotic resistance could make methenamine hippurate a viable preventative option if future research supports its use, a team of researchers led by Tammy Hoffmann at Bond University in Australia said in an editorial published alongside the study. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people get UTIs every year,\u201d says Jennifer Rohn at University College London. \u201cSo it is a serious pressure point on the antimicrobial resistance crisis because so many antibiotic prescriptions are prescribed\u2026 so anything that can knock down the number of prescriptions is a good thing.\u201d Journal reference: The BMJ, DOI: 10.1136/bmj-2021-0068229 Journal reference: The BMJ, DOI: 10.1136/bmj-2021-0068229 More on these topics:  \n                                        Magazine issue\n                                        \n                                            3378\n                                        \n                                        , published 19 March 2022\n                                     Previous article \n                                                Your organs may be ageing at different rates\n                                             Next article \n                                                Learning to live with covid-19 means covering up coughs and sneezes\n                                            "

        "text": "Prototype pillow contains an inflatable chamber that connects to an external pump and motor, enabling it to expand and deflate like human lungs By Carissa Wong A huggable pillow that mimics breathing has reduced anxiety as effectively as guided meditation for people who were about to take a mathematics test. Interactive tactile devices, such as Paro the cuddly seal robot, have previously been linked to reduced anxiety, potentially providing near-immediate relief without medication. To better understand the potential of these devices, Alice Haynes, now at Saarland University in Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, and her colleagues developed a pillow prototype that expands and deflates like human lungs. The team got a group of 129 volunteers to complete a questionnaire that measured their anxiety level before and after they were told they would need to complete a maths test. Next, 45 of the volunteers hugged the prototype pillow across their chest and torso for just over 8 minutes, while 40 of the participants listened to a guided meditation and the remaining 44 volunteers sat and did nothing, acting as the experiment\u2019s control group. The volunteers\u2019 anxiety was then measured again. Hugging the pillow was found to reduce pre-test anxiety by the same amount as the meditation, while the control group\u2019s anxiety increased ahead of the test. \u201cI think ultimately, it\u2019s just nice to give people with anxiety a choice of different ways to support themselves,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cA benefit of the cushion is that we haven\u2019t had to give anyone guidance on using it \u2013 it seems to be very intuitive. It\u2019s familiar and you don\u2019t have to use an app or be on your phone or any of your devices.\u201d The pillow, which is 36 centimetres long, contains an inflatable chamber that connects to an external pump and motor. Most of the volunteers adapted their breathing to match the pillow\u2019s expansion, according to Haynes. \u201cSlow breathing practices in general activate the part of the nervous system which is associated with rest and digest,\u201d she says.

Chen, et al., Science Translational Medicine (2022) Microscope images showing tissue damage in human donor kidneys without electrical treatment (top left and right) and less damage with treatment (bottom left and right) W. Chen, et al., Science Translational Medicine (2022) Electricity can help keep biological tissues functioning while stored in ice, a finding that could help boost the number of successful kidney transplants. The approach seems effective in mice given transplants and in human kidneys stored for 24 hours \u2013 although it hasn\u2019t yet been tried on organs put inside people. It could be used on other transplanted organs and even tissues inside the body with low blood supply, says Ruisheng Liu at the University of South Florida in Tampa. \u201cThere are lots of possibilities.\u201d Kidney transplants can be life-saving, but some kidneys don\u2019t function well after the surgery because they are damaged from lack of oxygen during transport. Low oxygen stops kidney cells making enough of a compound called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which normally powers a molecular pump on their surface that keeps sodium levels low and potassium levels high inside cells. The shutdown causes the cells to swell and damages many of their enzymes and other biochemicals. But the molecular pumps are sensitive to electrical fields, and Liu\u2019s group has found that putting electrodes on the surface of the kidney and applying an oscillating field can restart many of the cells\u2019 pumps. To test the approach, the researchers gave 10 mice a kidney transplant after storing the organs in cold saline before each was implanted. Seven mice received kidneys that had been given the electrical treatment, and these mice had a more than 50 per cent better kidney function than the three that received untreated organs, as judged by a commonly used blood test. They also tested the approach in five pairs of human kidneys that had been donated but weren\u2019t in a good enough condition to use. One of each pair had four electrodes placed on it while they were stored on ice for 24 hours. Afterwards, the cells of the treated kidneys had less damage when viewed under a microscope. Damage to transplanted kidneys from lack of oxygen is a big problem and contributes to immune rejection, says Kristin Veighey at the University of Southampton in the UK. \u201cIf you make [kidneys] last longer, then less people will return to the wait list.\u201d Journal reference: Science Translational Medicine, DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abj4906 Journal reference: Science Translational Medicine, DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abj4906 More on these topics:  \n                                        Magazine issue\n                                        \n                                            3378\n                                        \n                                        , published 19 March 2022\n                                     Previous article \n                                                AI can help historians restore ancient texts from damaged inscriptions\n                                             Next article \n                                                Hugging a pillow that mimics breathing could reduce anxiety\n                                            "

        "text": "Vital cooling systems for controlling nuclear waste at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant are offline, leading to concerns that radioactive waste might escape By Matthew Sparkes A drone image of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Pripyat, Ukraine, taken on 7 March 2022Russia MOD/EYEPRESS/Shutterstock A drone image of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Pripyat, Ukraine, taken on 7 March 2022 Russia MOD/EYEPRESS/Shutterstock Fears of a potential radiation leak at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are growing after a power cut at the site. Without electricity it will be difficult to cool ponds that contain hazardous nuclear waste and to filter the air inside the vast containment building that houses the remains of the reactor that was destroyed during an infamous disaster at the site in 1986. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, warned in a tweet that reserve diesel generators will operate for only 48 hours. \u201cAfter that, cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent,\u201d he wrote. Spent nuclear fuel from Chernobyl\u2019s former reactors is stored in a large cooling pond that is constantly replenished with fresh, cold water to keep its temperature down. Without an electricity supply \u2013 which the Ukrainian government says the site now lacks \u2013 this cooling has stopped, which will allow the water temperature to rise and increase the rate of evaporation. If the ponds are allowed to run dry then there is a chance that radioactive material could be released into the environment. There are also concerns that electrical air filters in the containment building around the reactor will stop, causing condensation that may harm the building. An update from the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine on 9 March said that there were no immediate concerns: \u201cThere are no violations of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) safe operation limits and conditions. Radioactive situation meets established norms. Systems of NPP physical protection work in normal mode.\u201d Mark Wenman at Imperial College London said in a statement to the UK Science Media Centre that although the power cut was a \u201cconcerning development\u201d there was no immediate risk of a radiation leak. \u201cThe last reactor unit at Chernobyl was shut down over 20 years ago and units 1 and 2 were shut down between 1991 and 1996. This means the heat produced by the fuel in the storage ponds will have substantially reduced over the 20 to 30 year period,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fuel storage ponds are also very deep and [it] would likely take weeks for the water to boil down even without cooling pumps active. This should hopefully allow enough time for the power to cooling systems to be restored.\u201d The situation at Chernobyl has been tense since the first day of the invasion when Russian troops seized the site. Scientists monitoring radiation levels at Chernobyl are unable to access their laboratories and instruments because Russian troops now control the plant. Other staff still working on the site on safety monitoring and decommissioning efforts are being held in poor conditions without the chance to take breaks away from the facility to rest, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA).  Radiation levels spiked at the site on the day it was captured by Russian forces, which was put down to Russian tanks disturbing dust that contained radioactive material. But many of the radiation sensors around the plant have been offline since. The IAEA director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has warned that a series of incidents at sensitive facilities across Ukraine have taken place in recent days. The IAEA says this presents a risk to safety, although there are no signs or evidence of radiation leaks. \u201cWe cannot go on like this. There has to be clear understandings, clear commitments, not to go anywhere near a nuclear facility when it comes to military operations,\u201d said Grossi at a press conference on 7 March. Ukraine's state-controlled energy company, the National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine, said in a statement on 9 March that its staff are still present at all six of the country's nuclear power plants but are \"forced to coordinate all technical issues with the occupiers\". \"The workers of the station are under strong psychological pressure from the occupiers,\" said the statement. The company reports that the Zaporizhzhia power plant is currently occupied by 50 units of heavy equipment and 400 soldiers. Details of the force at Chernobyl weren't given. More on these topics: "

        "text": "An AI tool developed by DeepMind can help historians restore ancient Greek texts with 72 per cent accuracy, and date inscriptions to within 30 years of their true age By Carissa Wong The Celsus Library in the ancient city of Ephesus, TurkeyMazur Travel/Shutterstock The Celsus Library in the ancient city of Ephesus, Turkey Mazur Travel/Shutterstock An artificial intelligence algorithm developed as part of a collaboration between historians and UK-based AI firm DeepMind can help restore ancient Greek texts with 72 per cent accuracy. The AI can also predict where in the ancient Mediterranean world the texts were originally written with more than 70 per cent accuracy and date them to within a few decades of their agreed-upon date of creation. All of this marks an improvement upon an earlier version of the AI that could only restore ancient texts. \u201cInscriptions provide evidence of the thought, language, society and history of past civilisations,\u201d says Thea Sommerschield at Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice in Italy. \u201cBut most surviving inscriptions have been damaged over the centuries, so their texts are now fragmentary or illegible. They may also have been moved or trafficked far from their original location.\u201d When recovering ancient texts, historians are usually interested in achieving three major goals: restoring the text, and working out exactly when and where it was written. To do this, they look for distinctive features and patterns in the style of writing and compare them to those of ancient texts that have already been found and dated. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s really difficult for a human to harness all existing relevant data, and to discover underlying patterns every time,\u201d says Sommerschield. Sommerschield and her colleagues worked with researchers at DeepMind to get the machine-learning AI \u2013 called Ithaca after a Greek island that is famous for being the home of the legendary figure Odysseus \u2013 to carry out all three tasks. To train Ithaca, the team used around 60,000 ancient Greek texts from across the Mediterranean that are already well-studied and known to have been written between 700 BC and AD 500. The team masked some of the characters in the texts and then compared Ithaca\u2019s predictions for this \u201cmissing\u201d text with the actual inscriptions. Next, the team used a data set of nearly 8000 inscriptions \u2013 again, already well-studied and understood \u2013 to test Ithaca\u2019s performance alone, or in combination with two ancient historians. On its own, Ithaca could restore texts with 62 per cent accuracy, while ancient historians alone restored text with around 25 per cent accuracy. However, the most accurate reconstructions involved Ithaca and historians working together. When historians took Ithaca\u2019s top 20 most likely reconstructions for a given text and used them to inform their own work, they could restore the text with an accuracy even greater than Ithaca alone. \u201cWhen historians used Ithaca, their performance on the text restoration task actually tripled, to 72 per cent,\u201d says Sommerschield. Ithaca could also predict where in the Mediterranean a text was written 71 per cent of the time and it could date the texts to within 30 years of their true date of creation, as previously established by historians. \u201cIt is clear that the authors\u2019 work is important and groundbreaking. The \u2018ancient historian and Ithaca\u2019 method produces startlingly significant improvements in outcomes over traditional human-only methods,\u201d says Tom Elliott at New York University. However, further testing with more historians is needed and people will need training and technical support to use the tool, he adds. The team says the feedback from historians so far has been positive. \u201cWe hope that the way we\u2019ve designed it, it\u2019s going to be easy for an ancient historian to use, because they will just type in the text [to an online interface] and then they will get all these visualisations that they can use,\u201d says Yannis Assael at DeepMind in the UK, and an author of the study. Ithaca\u2019s design should also make it easily applicable to any ancient language and any written medium, says Sommerschield.

        "text": "A study of the extinct Christmas Island rat suggests we cannot bring back the woolly mammoth and other lost species without important differences By Michael Le Page An illustration of the Christmas Island ratJoseph Smit/Public Domain An illustration of the Christmas Island rat Joseph Smit/Public Domain It is impossible to bring extinct animals back to life exactly as they were, according to a study of the extinct Christmas Island rat. Even though researchers were able to recover a very high-quality genome from preserved specimens, it was impossible to recreate many key genes, meaning any resurrected animal would differ in some important ways. \u201cYou may be missing what\u2019s most important for the extinct form,\u201d says Thomas Gilbert at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. \u201cIf you think you are going to create a mammoth that\u2019s exactly like the mammoth that went extinct, well, you are not really.\u201d Gilbert isn\u2019t opposed to de-extinction. It is feasible to create animals that can perform the same role in ecosystems as extinct ones, he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re happy with the end product, awesome.\u201d A few research groups are trying to resurrect extinct animals\u00a0by sequencing the DNA in preserved samples, then genetically editing the genome of a close living relative to make it like that of the extinct species. They include Colossal, a company that wants to create a woolly mammoth, and the TIGRR lab at the University of Melbourne, Australia, which aims to bring back the thylacine. On 9 March, Colossal announced that it had raised $75 million in funding, which it will spend on developing the technologies needed for de-extinction. The fundamental problem is that old DNA breaks up into lots of tiny pieces that are impossible to completely reassemble, says Gilbert. In the case of the Christmas Island rat (Rattus macleari) \u2013 also known as Maclear\u2019s rat \u2013 which went extinct in the early 20th century, the team was able to reassemble most of the pieces by using the genome of the related Norway brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) as a guide, but they couldn\u2019t assemble all of them. \u201cEvery bit of DNA that we could recover, we got,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a 5 per cent fraction we can\u2019t make sense of.\u201d Crucially, it is the parts of the extinct genome that differ most from the living relatives that are hardest to match and reassemble. This 5 per cent includes the genes that have been evolving the fastest, which are the ones that make closely related species different to each other. In other words, the most important pieces of the puzzle are the parts that can\u2019t be put back together, because those parts of the guide picture have been lost. With the Christmas Island rat, the team was able to recreate near-complete versions of around half of its genes. This includes genes related to its hair and ears, suggesting that it would be possible to create an animal with the long black hair and round ears characteristic of this species. However, many other genes, including those involved in the rat\u2019s immune system and its sense of smell, could only be partially reconstructed. Smell plays a key role in behaviours such as finding food, avoiding predators and choosing mates, says Gilbert, so any recreated Christmas Island rat might behave very differently to the original species. He has no plans to try to resurrect the Christmas Island rat. The team studied it only as a way of exploring what is possible. \u201cThis paper nicely shows that the more evolutionary distance there is between the extinct species [and living relatives], the more of the genome won\u2019t be correctly assembled,\u201d says Beth Shapiro at the University of California, Santa Cruz. \u201cDoes this mean that we will never, ever be able to reconstruct a genome using gene editing that is 100 per cent identical to a specific extinct organism? Yes,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that is not surprising, and nor does it mean that Colossal will never be able to create an Arctic-adapted elephant that some might call a mammoth or that the TIGRR lab won\u2019t be able to create a marsupial that has physical and behavioural traits that reflect the evolution of the Tasmanian tiger.\u201d \u201cThe goal of de-extinction has always been to create functional equivalents,\u201d says Ben Novak at Revive & Restore, a US conservation non-profit whose initiatives include efforts to resurrect the passenger pigeon and the heath hen. \u201cUltimately, the paper changes nothing about how de-extinction works in practice or how the world\u2019s four projects are proceeding,\u201d he says.

        "text": "A large species of gharial, an animal closely related to crocodiles, roamed China 3000 years ago, but was probably driven extinct by humans By Michael Marshall Hanyusuchus sinensis fossils and a drawing of the gharialIllustration by Hikaru Amemiya Hanyusuchus sinensis fossils and a drawing of the gharial Illustration by Hikaru Amemiya An unknown crocodile-like animal probably lived in China until just a few hundred years ago. The creature may have been more than 6 metres long and its discovery helps make sense of the evolution of crocodiles and their relatives. Chinese researchers discovered the animal\u2019s bones in the 1960s and 1970s, but they were misidentified as a living species and ignored, says Masaya Iijima at Clemson University in South Carolina. Iijima and his colleagues have now studied four of the specimens, which include skulls and other parts of the body. The creature was a gharial, an animal closely related to crocodiles and alligators, but with a much thinner snout. Today, there are only two gharial species: one from India and neighbouring countries, and one from Malaysia and Indonesia. All the specimens of the new extinct gharial come from south-east China. The team named it Hanyusuchus sinensis, after a Chinese politician and poet called Han Yu (AD 768-824). Confronted with crocodiles that were attacking humans and livestock, Han Yu issued a proclamation instructing the animals to leave or be killed. Three of the specimens have been carbon-dated. They lived around 3000 years ago during the Chinese Bronze Age. However, historical accounts of dangerous gharial-like animals are known from as recently as 500 years ago, so Iijima thinks Chinese gharials survived \u201cuntil at least 300 years ago\u201d. One of the skulls has 17 chop marks on it, suggesting people cut it up using heavy bronze weapons. Humans probably drove the Chinese gharial to extinction, says Minoru Yoneda at the University of Tokyo, who also worked on the study. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say that direct attack by humans is the main cause of extinction,\u201d he says, because rice farming probably cut into its habitat, but either way humans are probably responsible. The Chinese gharial clarifies a mystery about crocodilians, the group that includes crocodiles, alligators and gharials. Genetic evidence shows that alligators were the first group to split from the others, and crocodiles and gharials separated from each other later. That is odd because, among previously known species, crocodiles and alligators more closely resemble one another than gharials. But the Chinese gharial is intermediate in body shape between gharials and the other two groups. \u201cThere was a huge gap between the gharial and the rest of the crocodilians,\u201d says Iijima. \u201cOur specimens fit in the gap.\u201d Journal reference: Proceedings of the Royal Society B, DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2022.0085 Journal reference: Proceedings of the Royal Society B, DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2022.0085 More on these topics:  \n                                        Magazine issue\n                                        \n                                            3378\n                                        \n                                        , published 19 March 2022\n                                     Previous article \n                                                Hugging a pillow that mimics breathing could reduce anxiety\n                                             Next article \n                                                Your organs may be ageing at different rates\n                                            "

Other staff still monitoring the\u00a0decommissioned nuclear reactors on the site are reportedly being held in poor conditions without the chance to take breaks away from the facility to rest. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant, notorious as the site of a major nuclear disaster in 1986, no longer generates electricity. But the facility\u2019s decommissioned reactors must still be carefully monitored for radioactivity and nuclear waste clear-up operations at the site will continue for several decades. \u201cWe continue scientific monitoring as much as possible,\u201d says the nuclear expert from the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons. \u201cThis is very far from [the] usual volume [of testing] because [my colleagues]\u00a0have no access to our labs and instruments in Chernobyl, but we do our best in monitoring important values, sometimes by indirect data.\u201d The scientist tells New Scientist that all of his team were able to escape the facility and leave the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone on the first day of the invasion. Despite this, some of those staff are now caught in areas of intense fighting. He says his team advises staff at the working part of the nuclear power plant and adds that they remain in contact. But it has now been almost two weeks since Russia seized the plant and the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) director general Rafael Mariano Grossi\u00a0says that the 210 staff on site have still not been able to leave for rest, something he stressed is\u00a0important for them to carry out their jobs safely. The anonymous scientist says that workers at the plant are \u201cheroes\u201d for continuing to ensure nuclear and radiation safety under those conditions. The IAEA has now listed a series of incidents at nuclear power plants that it says present a risk to safety, although there are no signs or evidence of radiation leaks.  \"We cannot go on like this. There has to be clear understandings, clear commitments, not to go anywhere near a nuclear facility when it comes to military operations,\" said Grossi at a press conference on 7 March. On the first day of the invasion there were radiation spikes at the Chernobyl plant, which the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine put down to Russian military vehicles stirring up radioactive dust. On 26 February, an electrical transformer at a radioactive waste disposal facility near Kharkiv was damaged, and the following day\u00a0missiles hit the site of a similar facility in Kyiv. No radiation leaks were detected after these attacks. On 4 March, a fire was started by missiles targeted at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The blaze was later put out, but reports suggest that firefighters initially came under fire from Russian forces. A neutron generator at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology used for scientific research has also been destroyed by shelling, says Grossi, and there are concerns about a lack of communication from staff at an oncology centre in Mariupol that has radioactive materials. We clarified that the Chernobyl power plant is no longer generating electricity More on these topics: "

        "text": "The organs in your body aren't necessarily the same biological age, and tracking their individual ageing trajectories could help predict your risk of developing specific diseases By Carissa Wong Artistic illustration of the human kidneysShutterstock / crystal light Artistic illustration of the human kidneys Shutterstock / crystal light An analysis of hundreds of biological features strengthens the evidence that some organs and body systems can age faster than others. Tracking the biological age of different parts of the body could help doctors predict the onset of disease more accurately. We already knew that the condition of cells in the body can be interpreted to give someone a biological age that is older or younger than their age measured in years. In other words, cell condition \u2013 which varies depending on genetic and lifestyle factors \u2013 determines the pace of the ageing process. Now, work by Brian Kennedy at the National University of Singapore and his colleagues supports the idea that the various organs and systems in the body \u2013 such as the cardiovascular or immune system \u2013 can age at different rates within the same individual. \u201cIt confirms previous studies that there are diverse ageing rates among organs and systems, and people\u2019s ageing patterns are different,\u201d says Wenyu Zhou at Tempus Labs, a biotechnology company in California. \u201cThis further calls for personalised health assessments that holistically consider various ageing processes.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s team collected stool and blood samples from about 480 people aged between 20 and 45 and measured a total of 403 biological features in each individual. The team classified these biomarkers into nine categories to assess the biological age of the kidneys, liver, gut microbiome, cardiovascular system, immune system, metabolic system and sex hormone system. The team also assessed biological age using physical fitness tests and by analysing photographs of participants\u2019 faces. Out of the nine systems and organs assessed, the biological age of an individual\u2019s cardiovascular system correlated the most with the people\u2019s age in years \u2013 their \u201cchronological age\u201d. The biological age of the gut microbiome showed the weakest link with chronological age. Meanwhile, the biological age of the liver and sex hormone systems varied the most between individuals. This confirmed that distinct parts of the body have different biological ages. The team also discovered that the biological age of the liver could be used to predict which people had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \u2013 a risk factor for type 2 diabetes \u2013 and the severity of the condition. This suggested that tracking the biological ages of individual organs could help predict disease risk in those areas. \u00a0\u201cThere are still many steps before translating the findings to real-world applications,\u201d says Zhou. For instance, it is still unclear if there are interventions that could slow down the ageing process for a specific organ or system, she says.

A senior UN source said that the COP15 conference, which was due to be held at Kunming in China during April and May, will now start at the end of August instead. Past delays have been blamed on the covid-19 pandemic, despite similar major meetings on climate change going ahead. The latest postponement means that COP15 will now take place almost two years later than originally scheduled, and leaves the world without targets for stemming extinctions and stopping habitat losses this decade. An official announcement hasn\u2019t yet been made, but is expected when negotiations resume in Geneva, Switzerland, on 14 March. A spokesperson for the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN body behind the COP15 summit, told New Scientist: \u201cThe COP [conference of the parties] bureau, at its last meeting, discussed that the UN Biodiversity Conference could be moved to the third quarter. However, the official decision on this has not yet been taken.\u201d One of the key parts of the deal being negotiated, known as the Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework, is a goal to make 30 per cent of Earth\u2019s land and seas into protected areas by 2030. Other issues include the ecological integrity of those areas and the agricultural subsidies that are a key driver of biodiversity loss. While conservationists and economists regard a new global biodiversity deal as essential, the world has a poor track record in this area. None of the 20 goals that governments set in 2010 for 2020, including halving the rate at which natural habitats are being lost, were fully met. The UK government last year paused publishing new data monitoring the state of the country\u2019s wildlife and ecosystems. Sue Lieberman at the Wildlife Conservation Society, a US-based non-profit organisation, says:\u00a0\u201cThough it\u2019s unfortunate that the COP in Kunming won\u2019t take place until late August, we agree with many governments that such negotiations cannot take place productively through virtual means, and that governments and other stakeholders need to meet in person. Hopefully, the postponement will give governments sufficient time to adopt a strong, meaningful Global Biodiversity Framework.\u201d More on these topics: "

The harm is thought to be most pronounced among people born in the 1960s and 1970s, when use of this fuel was at its peak. Similar effects have probably occurred in other high-income countries, says Aaron Reuben at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cPatterns of lead use in gasoline throughout the last century were very similar across developed countries.\u201d Lead began being added to petrol in the 1920s to make car engines run more smoothly. If the substance enters the brain, it can disrupt nerve signalling and, at higher levels, kill brain cells. Young children are particularly susceptible due to the metal disrupting brain development. Using data from a national survey, Reuben and his colleagues analysed the circulating lead levels of over 11,600 children aged 1 to 5 years from blood samples drawn between 1976 and 2016. They also estimated blood lead levels for the period from 1940 to 1975 based on leaded petrol use during that time. This data was then linked to an established formula of how lead exposure influences IQ. Their results suggest half the current US population had elevated lead levels in their blood as children. Across the country, they estimate that lead exposure may have caused an average IQ drop of 2.6 points. People born in the mid-to-late 1960s may have lost an average of 5.9 points. In the 1970s, it was recognised that tiny particles of lead in exhaust fumes could enter people\u2019s bloodstreams and higher environmental levels of the metal were linked with worse school performance in children. Leaded gasoline was banned for use in road vehicles in the US in 1996 and in the UK in 2000. The latest study demonstrates the enduring effects of certain environmental toxins, says Mathew Hauer at Florida State University, who was involved in the work. \u201cThe long legacy is really important. The effects can last for a significant amount of time.

        "text": "Some spider species that live in groups of thousands on enormous webs synchronise their movements to catch insects up to 700 times heavier than an individual spider By Christa Lest\u00e9-Lasserre Some spider species hunt in packs, moving as one to catch their preyLest\u00e9-Lasserre Some spider species hunt in packs, moving as one to catch their prey Lest\u00e9-Lasserre Spiders that hunt in packs use web vibrations to coordinate their attacks, allowing them to kill prey hundreds of times larger than they could on their own. Of the 50,000 known spider species, just one or two hunt as a group, with thousands of individuals spread across webs that can span several cubic metres. When prey insects land on their web, the spiders synchronise their attack, moving as one to catch animals up to 700 times heavier than an individual arachnid. To better understand how this works, researchers led by Rapha\u00ebl Jeanson at the University of Toulouse, France, disturbed the webs of two colonies of Anelosimus eximius, a social spider species. They mimicked the movement of prey by creating vibrations in different parts of the webs, while filming the spiders\u2019 movements. Jeanson and his team then analysed the movements frame by frame, finding that the spiders pause their motion towards prey, and restart it, at the same time. The stopping time corresponded with the amount of \u201cnoise\u201d in the web, according to computer models of the spiders\u2019 motion. The arachnids only stayed still for as long as they had to in order to distinguish the vibrations caused by their fellow spiders from those of their prey. \u201cIt\u2019s like when there are lots of people talking in a crowded room and then there\u2019s this other noise, like a telephone that rings, and everyone has to hush to find the source of the noise,\u201d says Jeanson. \u201cOf course, the louder the telephone\u2019s ring, the less people have to be quiet to find the phone and it\u2019s the same thing with these social spiders.\u201d \u201cDepending on the size of the prey \u2013 and the vibrations that the prey creates on the web \u2013 the spiders have to be more or less quiet and still in order to localise the prey without getting disturbed by the vibrations of other spiders that are moving around,\u201d he says. After the spiders come to a collective halt, the group starts moving when one or two individuals become mobile, with there being no sign of a leader among the pack. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how it works exactly, but when one of them moves, it sets them all moving,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really a snowball effect.\u201d Synchronised hunting means the spiders can catch butterflies, grasshoppers and other flying insects, which struggle to free themselves from the web. The webs of these social spiders aren\u2019t sticky, so the spiders have to act quickly to avoid their prey escaping. The stop-start approach does extend the hunt, but it may be time well spent. \u201cIf they all arrive at the same time, there\u2019s a strength in numbers that\u2019s really beneficial compared to a disordered arrival of individual spiders that get lost in the web along the way. There\u2019s a clear advantage of synchronisation despite the costs of the waiting time,\u201d says Jeanson. The spiders also synchronise when they eject an immobilising glue from their hind legs and bite their prey, injecting a venom.

        "text": "Goose bones from Stone Age China suggest the birds were being domesticated there 7000 years ago, which could mean they were domesticated before chickens By Michael Marshall Chinese geese (Anser cygnoides domesticus)blickwinkel/AGAMI/M. Guyt/Alamy Chinese geese (Anser cygnoides domesticus) blickwinkel/AGAMI/M. Guyt/Alamy Geese may have been domesticated as early as 7000 years ago in what is now China, according to a study of preserved goose bones. That may make them the first bird to be domesticated, before chickens \u2013 although the timing of chicken domestication is uncertain. The finding extends the history of goose domestication and potentially the history of domestic poultry as a whole, says Masaki Eda at Hokkaido University Museum in Sapporo, Japan. Eda is part of a team that has excavated an archaeological site in east China called Tianluoshan, which was a Stone Age village between about 7000 and 5500 years ago. Its inhabitants \u201cwere basically hunter-gatherers\u201d, says Eda, but they also grew rice in paddy fields. The researchers have identified 232 goose bones at Tianluoshan and say there are multiple lines of evidence that some of the geese were at least partially domesticated. Four of the bones belonged to immature geese that were less than 16 weeks old, with the youngest probably less than eight weeks old. This implies they must have hatched at Tianluoshan, says Eda, because they were too young to have flown in from elsewhere. However, no wild geese breed in the area today and it is unlikely they did so 7000 years ago, he says. Some of the adult geese also seem to have been locally bred, based on the chemical make-up of their bones, which reflects the water they drank. These locally bred birds were all roughly the same size, indicating captive breeding. Finally, the researchers carbon-dated the bones and found that the locally bred geese lived about 7000 years ago. Taken together, the findings suggest the geese were at an early stage of domestication, says Eda. \u201cIt\u2019s a major study in our understanding of poultry domestication,\u201d says Oph\u00e9lie Lebrasseur at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very thorough.\u201d \u201cThe main thing that stood out for me is the fact they actually did radiocarbon dating on the bird bones,\u201d says Julia Best at Cardiff University in the UK. This makes the dating much more reliable than if they had simply dated the surrounding sediment. If geese were domesticated 7000 years ago, that would make them the first bird to be domesticated, says Eda. The other candidate is chickens, but there has been a dispute over when and where this first happened. Chickens were probably domesticated from wild birds called red junglefowl, which live in southern Asia. However, genetics has complicated the story, revealing that domestic chickens subsequently interbred with other birds like the grey junglefowl. A study published in 2014 reported that chickens were domesticated in northern China as early as 10,000 years ago, based on DNA from bones. However, it isn\u2019t clear that red junglefowl ever lived that far north, says Lebrasseur. Furthermore, the bones weren\u2019t directly dated and \u201ca lot of the things they claimed were chickens were pheasants\u201d, says Best. Firm evidence of domestic chickens only appears from around 5000 years ago, she says. This implies geese were domesticated before chickens, says Lebrasseur. \u201cWith the evidence we currently have, I think it is true,\u201d she says. But she adds that bird domestications are understudied compared with those of mammals like dogs and cows, so the story could well change as more evidence emerges. It is very difficult to say why the geese were domesticated, says Eda. Meat, eggs, feathers and bone tools are all possibilities, and they may have been used in ritual ceremonies. \u201cOne of the things we see with chickens is they\u2019re often held in high esteem when they\u2019re first domesticated,\u201d says Best.

        "text": "More than three-quarters of the world's largest rainforest has become less resilient to drought since the early 2000s, with areas near humans and with lower rainfall being the worst hit By Adam Vaughan An area deforested for gold mining, along the Interoceanic highway linking Peru and Brazil in the Amazon region of Madre de DiosMariana Bazo/REUTERS/Alamy An area deforested for gold mining, along the Interoceanic highway linking Peru and Brazil in the Amazon region of Madre de Dios Mariana Bazo/REUTERS/Alamy The Amazon rainforest is nearing a tipping point that will see it transform into savannah, according to researchers who have found that the biodiversity hotspot has lost resilience in the past two decades. Previous studies have warned that the world\u2019s largest rainforest, which acts as a vital brake on climate change, is approaching a critical threshold. But most past research has relied on projections using models, not real world observations. Now, Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter, UK, and his colleagues have used two sets of satellite data covering between 1996 and 2016 to measure the greenness of the Amazon over time, watching for how it recovered after impacts such as drought and fires. They found that since the early 2000s, 76 per cent of the region had become less resilient, or less able to restore itself to a stable state after being affected by events. Importantly, says Lenton, the signal of this growing instability was picked up without immediately obvious changes such as huge drops in the forest\u2019s biomass or tree cover. \u201cWhy do we care about it? It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that if it gets to that tipping point and we commit to losing the Amazon rainforest then we get a significant feedback to global climate change,\u201d says Lenton. He says a shift to savannah, a grassy ecosystem with much less biomass, would unlock about 90 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide stored in the trees and soil. Humanity emits about 40 billion a year. The team looked at vegetation cover using one satellite data set\u00a0that measures the optical depth of vegetation using microwaves, and a second one that used infrared instead. The loss of resilience was faster in parts of the rainforest that have received less rainfall and those that are closer to the biggest signs of human activities, such as large farms and major roads, say the researchers. Lenton says he cannot put a precise date on how far off the rainforest\u2019s tipping point might be, but expects the transition to savannah to be a process that would take decades. Other Amazon experts say the research adds to a growing body of evidence that the rainforest is approaching a tipping point. The shifts aren\u2019t even across the rainforest. The south-eastern part of the Amazon, dubbed the \u201carc of deforestation\u201d, has already changed to the point at which it is now a carbon emitter rather than a carbon sink. Matt Finer at the Amazon Conservation non-profit organisation says the research could offer a guide for which remaining parts of the forest to prioritise for protection. \u201cThe western and north-east Amazon appear the most resilient, reinforcing the critical need to protect these areas now and in the future from current and looming threats like mining, new roads and agriculture expansion,\u201d he says. Carlos Nobre at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, says the research is \u201cconcerning\u201d and \u201csolid data-based\u201d work. \u201cIt demonstrates that the resilience of the Amazon tropical rainforest has been very rapidly decreasing over the last 20 years,\u201d he says.

        "text": "Recordings from electrodes in people\u2019s brains reveal that certain neurons in the hippocampus show a burst of activity to mark the boundary between different events By Clare Wilson Illustration of neurons in the hippocampusKATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Illustration of neurons in the hippocampus KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY A newly discovered kind of brain cell involved in memory formation seems to mark the boundary between distinct events as we experience them. The neurons, which have been called boundary cells, fire when new events happen, such as if we see someone walking into a room. The cells were discovered in people with epilepsy who had electrodes put into their brain before surgery, by asking them to watch films showing sequences of events. \u201cIt has long been appreciated in psychology that memory is not continuous, that it\u2019s formed in chunks. But this has never been observed at the single neuron level,\u201d says Ueli Rutishauser at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Much about how memories form is still unclear, but several insights have emerged from studying people who need electrodes put into their hippocampi \u2013 two curved structures on either side of the brain \u2013 because they have epileptic seizures that start in these regions. The hippocampi and surrounding areas of the brain are crucial for making new memories. To work out exactly which part of the brain is malfunctioning, people with epilepsy may stay in hospital for several days with electrodes implanted to record brain activity. Each electrode has eight tiny wires protruding from it, and each wire can distinguish activity from up to five surrounding neurons. In the latest study, Rutishauser\u2019s team asked 19 such people to watch carefully constructed film sequences while the recording took place, listening to about 30 cells per person. About 7 per cent of the neurons were boundary cells, whose firing peaked when new things happened. \u201cThey don\u2019t say anything about the memory content, they just say there is a boundary,\u201d says Rutishauser. He speculates that activity in these cells signals that the brain should begin to form a new memory, like starting a new folder. When people were tested later by showing them pictures from the films, they were better at remembering scenes from straight after a boundary than those that had happened a few seconds later. The findings \u201cmake a lot of sense\u201d, says Rodrigo Quian Quiroga at the University of Leicester, UK. \u201cThey suggest a mechanism by which the hippocampus is signalling what scenes to put together and what scenes not to put together.\u201d Boundary cells haven\u2019t been seen before because previous work in people with electrodes implanted before epilepsy surgery used memory tests involving words or still pictures, not films, says Rutishauser.

        "text": "A 1.4-million-year-old fossil relative of killer whales had teeth that suggest it ate small fish rather than large marine mammals By Christa Lest\u00e9-Lasserre Artistic reconstruction of Rododelphis stamatiadisiRossella Faleni Artistic reconstruction of Rododelphis stamatiadisi Rossella Faleni A 1.4-million-year-old ancestor of orcas and false killer whales seems to have dined on small fish \u2013 which suggests its descendants adapted to hunt larger prey such as other dolphin and whales relatively recently. \u201cThis is an extraordinary fossil that helps qualify the origin of the unique diet of killer whales and false killer whales,\u201d says Giovanni Bianucci at the University of Pisa, Italy. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to give a precise date, but these cetaceans seem to have evolved to eat marine mammals less than a million years ago.\u201d Orcas (Orcinus orca) \u2013 also known as killer whales \u2013 and false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) are the only living species of cetaceans that feed on other marine mammals. When they evolved to do so is unclear because cetacean fossils are exceptionally rare, says Bianucci. So Bianucci was pleasantly surprised to learn that a private collector had found a skeleton of a Pleistocene-epoch false killer whale on the Greek island of Rhodes, in 2021. The specimen was donated to the Stamatiadis Museum of Mineralogy and Paleontology on the island. Analyses of the specimen revealed that the fossil was new to science, says Bianucci. His team named it Rododelphis stamatiadisi in honour both of Rhodes and of the collector, Polychronis Stamatiadis. The scientists noted that the R. stamatiadisi fossil had a body about 5-metres long, which is similar to modern false killer whale \u2013 but it had smaller teeth, says Bianucci. In addition, its teeth lacked the deep grooves seen in killer whale and false killer whale teeth \u2013 which are adaptations important for crunching tough mammal bones. This suggests that the species probably hunted smaller prey \u2013 more evidence for which comes from the fossilised remains of blue whiting fish (Micromesistius poutassou) found within the ancient dolphin. M. poutassou \u2013 which still exists today \u2013 is a 30-centimetre-long fish. It was clearly the R. stamatiadisi\u2019s last meal, says Bianucci. Fitting R. stamatiadisi into cetacean genealogy, Bianucci and his colleagues determined that the animal shared a common ancestor with modern false killer whales \u2013 and that this ancestor descended from the same line that orcas did. Significantly, early members of the orca group also seem to have hunted small prey rather than dolphins and whales. The group includes a 4-million-year-old species (Orcinus citoniensis) found fossilised in Italy in the 19th century, which also lacked mammal-crunching teeth, says Bianucci. The findings hints that cetacean-hunting predators evolved independently in both killer and false killer whales during the second half of the Pleistocene, beginning about 1.3 million years ago, says Bianucci. The find is important, he says, because it might help overturn a popular theory that baleen whales, such as blue and humpback whales, became gigantic in size in order to avoid attack by killer whales. The baleen whales were already huge by about 3 million years ago \u2013 long before Bianucci believes the orcas and false killer whales began hunting them.

Now, initial data collected by the rover suggests that the site has been subject to long periods of weathering in the past by wind, and maybe even water. During Zhurong\u2019s first 60 sols (Mars-days) of operation, it traversed 450.9 metres of flat land littered with small rocks. At the same time, the rover collected data to study the planet\u2019s geological structure and surface composition, which included taking soil and dust samples as well as capturing images with a camera called NaTeCam. Liang Ding at the Harbin Institute of Technology in China and his colleagues analysed this initial data. Many of the rocks that were found around the landing site were covered with etchings and grooves on one side, which indicates that they must have undergone intense wind erosion from sand. Some of the rocks also have a flaky texture, which typically arises from interactions with water, say the authors. The rover also encountered several megaripples on the Martian surface \u2013 wind-sculpted features made up of loose sediment that span several metres. \u201cThe examples Zhurong has visited appear very bright-toned in satellite images taken from orbit, and the team thinks that this is because the megaripples are covered with a layer of very fine dust,\u201d says Matt Balme at the Open University, UK, who wasn\u2019t involved in the analysis. \u201cThis means these features are probably currently inactive, as any present-day windblown sand would tend to remove the dust.\u201d Scientists got a first glimpse of Utopia Planitia\u2019s rocks with NASA\u2019s Viking 2 lander in 1976. At that time, they were widely interpreted as fragments of basaltic lava, says John Bridges at the University of Leicester, UK. \u201cHowever, the landing site rocks here don\u2019t obviously look like basaltic lava terrain that we associate with the crust at Utopia Planitia,\u201d says Bridges. \u201cZhurong is suggesting a more complicated geological evolution than expected from Viking 2.\u201d \u201cFrom Viking 2, the paradigm was that Mars was a big lump of basalt with maybe a few flood channels,\u201d says Bridges. But now the evidence from the rover supports a paradigm shift towards a sedimentary Mars, he says. The soil samples taken at the site by Zhurong were found to have a similar composition to those collected by other rovers elsewhere on Mars. Overall, these initial findings suggest that this site has the potential to provide more insight into the history of the planet\u2019s surface. \u201cWhat\u2019s really exciting is that many scientists think that Utopia Planitia may have once hosted an ancient liquid water ocean, billions of years ago,\u201d says Joel Davis at the Natural History Museum in London. \u201cHopefully, as Zhurong continues to explore, it will be able to help answer this question [of whether there was an ocean] that\u2019s been plaguing scientists for decades.\u201d Journal reference: Nature Geoscience, DOI: 10.1038/s41561-022-00905-6 Journal reference: Nature Geoscience, DOI: 10.1038/s41561-022-00905-6 More on these topics:  \n                                        Magazine issue\n                                        \n                                            3377\n                                        \n                                        , published 12 March 2022\n                                     Previous article \n                                                Solar panel add-on pulls water from air without consuming electricity\n                                             Next article \n                                                Dinosaur that broke its wrist may have fallen while mating\n                                            "

        "text": "China is, along with North America and Europe, one of the world's top three air travel markets. It has dramatically improved safety since a string of deadly crashes in the 1990s and 2000s. The crash Monday of a China Eastern flight comes after years free of major air disasters. The country has not reported a crash of a commercial flight with more than five fatalities since 2010. The ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, also has suffered fatal crashes, but few details are available. China Eastern is, along with Air China, China Southern Airlines and HNA Group, one of four major carriers in China, all state-owned. Founded in 1995, the airline is headquartered at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport. Its fleet of 749 aircraft includes 291 from the Boeing 737 series, according to its mid-2021 interim report. The carrier has 79,913 employees, mostly in China. It carried 44.3 million passengers in the first half of 2021. China Eastern reported a loss of 5.4 billion yuan ($850 million) in the first half of 2021. Carriers have suffered heavy financial losses as the government tries to eliminate COVID-19 with a ``zero tolerance'' strategy that bars most foreign visitors from China and has disrupted travel by suspending access temporarily to major cities. Passenger numbers within China exceeded the United States in 2020 for the first time, according to Boeing Co. That was partly because populous China reopened to domestic travel relatively quickly after the initial coronavirus outbreak. Boeing forecasts 5.4% annual traffic growth and says China should account for one-sixth of future added airline capacity. State media reported all 737-800s in China Eastern's fleet were ordered grounded. Aviation experts said it is unusual to ground an entire fleet of planes unless there is evidence of a problem with the model. China has more 737-800s than any other country _ nearly 1,200 _ and if identical planes at other Chinese airlines are grounded, it ``could have a significant impact on domestic travel,'' said aviation consultant IBA.

The two countries never signed a peace treaty formally ending World War II hostilities because of their dispute over the Russian-held islands north of Hokkaido, which Moscow took at the end of the war. ``The latest situation has been all caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters Tuesday.  He called Russia's response ``extremely unjustifiable and absolutely unacceptable.'' Japan has imposed a series of sanctions on Russia in recent weeks, including freezing some individual assets, banning exports of luxury goods and high-technology equipment to the country and revoking Russia's most favored nation trade status.

Rescuers and police divers on Tuesday were continuing the search for one person still missing after the chartered boat that was carrying 10 people broke apart in stormy seas Sunday night. Five people were rescued from the sea at around midnight after clinging to different sections of the overturned wreckage for hours, and four bodies were later recovered during daylight hours. The video was shot from the Northland Rescue Helicopter at about 12:30 a.m. Monday after the boat's rescue beacon was activated more than four hours earlier off the remote North Cape. Helicopter pilot Lance Donnelly told The Associated Press he wore night vision goggles as they flew to the scene with a team that included another pilot, a winch operator and a rescue swimmer.

        "description": "The NHL trade deadline has passed, so which teams improved and which teams fell flat?",
        "link": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nhl/news/2022-nhl-trade-deadline-winners-losers-maple-leafs-panthers-stanley-cup/o454mkelmgrtuopvs0mtkydm",
        "text": "The NHL trade deadline is officially over.\u00a0The list of dizzying moves separated the contenders from pretenders and brought some clarity heading into the home stretch. While some teams that landed major players in order to make a playoff push, just as many teams left us scratching our heads.\u00a0 Now that the dust has settled, we're here to help make sense of all. Here are Sporting News' winners and losers of the 2022 NHL trade deadline.\u00a0 MORE:\u00a0NHL trade deadline tracker: Latest rumors, news, updates for 2022 deadline day The Maple Leafs needed to improve on defense at the deadline if they really wanted to contend for a Cup. General manager Kyle Dubas did just that, acquiring veteran Mark Giordano from the Kraken.\u00a0 Dubas didn't want to use his first-round pick in a trade and with Giordano wanting to go to Toronto, Dubas was able to acquire him, along with forward Colin Blackwell, for two seconds and a third.\u00a0 The fact that they didn't trade for a goaltender isn't as big of a deal as some Maple Leafs fans may think. It's still a concern for now with rookie Erik Kallgren the de facto starter with Jack Campbell sidelined and Petr Mrzaek sent down to the AHL. But if Campbell can return from injury and be better than the goaltender the Maple Leafs saw the last three months, Toronto will be in good shape.\u00a0 MORE:\u00a0Mark Giordano trade grades: Maple Leafs improve on defense without giving up 1st-round pick It's always tough to navigate the deadline when a team is right on the cusp on a playoff spot. Do you sell and admit defeat? Or buy and make an honest postseason push? The Stars elected to do nothing. In a vacuum, perhaps that would be fine except for the fact that general manager Jim Nill essentially sent two different messages by not making a move. They didn't acquire any major piece, so it doesn't appear as though they are a team that doesn't think they can make a serious run in the postseason. Which makes sense, considering a first-round matchup with the Avalanche or Flames likely looms ahead if they sneak in as a Wild Card.\u00a0 But while they stood pat, the Stars also failed to move John Klingberg, who requested a trade earlier in the season and does not appear to be re-signing this offseason. He would have been a great trade chip, with a number of teams interested in the right-handed defenseman. Instead, Dallas elected to hold onto him for the rest of the year.\u00a0 So which is it, Nill? Why keep Klingberg for the rest of the season while not making any other moves to make the club better?\u00a0 Ron Francis had a BUSY deadline, shipping off six players and in return, gaining back 10 draft\u00a0picks in total. He didn't get another first-round pick, missing out on that opportunity in the Giordano deal, but did get a higher than expected return on others, like Jeremy Lauzon going to the Predators for a second.\u00a0 As a result, the Kraken now have 34 picks spanning over the next three drafts. That's huge for the club, especially with the 2023 draft expected to be one of the deepest ones in recent years.\u00a0 It's a team that needed to hit on order to start building its roster, well, all over again. Francis missed with the expansion draft and free agency last summer. But he sold off every single pending free agent the team had, with Jared McCann being the exception after signing an extension.\u00a0 By acquiring all the draft picks, Francis has set up this team to build through the draft for the next three seasons.\u00a0 New Jersey sits at the bottom of the Atlantic Division, second-to-last in the Eastern Conference and in no position to sniff the postseason. While they did not have a ton of goods to sell, there was the potential for moves to be made.\u00a0 Instead, general manager Tom Fitzgerald kept all his cards, failing to make an impactful move. There was the opportunity to trade away P.K. Subban (UFA), Pavel Zacha (RFA) or even MacKenzie Blackwood, who had gained interest as a goaltending solution for a contender.\u00a0 But the trio remain as members of the Devils with the deadline passed by. Doing something is better than nothing when you're one of the worst teams in the league. Fitzgerald misstepped and the Devils walked away with no additional future assets.\u00a0 General manager Bill Zito fully embraced the \"win-now\" mantra, going all-in by acquiring Claude Giroux from the Flyers and Ben Chiarot from the Canadiens.\u00a0 Chiarot addressed a need on the defense's left side and it could not have come at a better time, with Aaron Ekblad going down for the rest of the regular season with a leg injury. Chiarot cannot produce the same on offense as Ekblad, but the hole left on the blue line isn't as bad.\u00a0 Florida already had arguably the deepest forward group in the league. There is no doubt they are now after adding Giroux. He wanted to go to Florida to win his first Stanley Cup and with his addition, there is a good chance that comes true.\u00a0 The best team in the Eastern Conference just got even better. The Panthers are going to be a handful for defenses to contain.\u00a0 MORE:\u00a0Claude Giroux trade details: Flyers captain heads to Panthers to join a Stanley Cup favorite The Oilers plan at the deadline should have been simple\u00a0\u2014 trade for a goaltender. Mike Smith can't stay healthy and Mikko Koskinen simply isn't cutting it.\u00a0 General manager Ken Holland is once electing to triple down on the duo he currently has in net, as the Oilers did not acquire a goaltender. It's a baffling move considering the Oilers give up 3.16 goals per game, ranking 21st in the league. Only the Wild are averaging more goals per game among teams currently in a playoff spot, and they just added Marc-Andre Fleury.\u00a0 I like the additions of Brett Kulak and Derrick Brassard to help give some depth throughout the lineup, but it's been the same story for a number of seasons now. Edmonton is wasting away the prime years of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl because the team can't keep the puck out of their own net.\u00a0 Pat Verbeek had a number of notable pending free agents that he tried to sign to an extension. He didn't ink any of these players, but he made the smart move to instead pivot towards trading these players and help the Ducks with their rebuild.\u00a0 He sent off Hampus Lindholm, Josh Manson, Rickard Rakell and Nic Deslauriers, all pending free agents. In return, the club stocked up with a first-round pick, four second-round picks, a third-round pick, NHLers Zach Aston-Reese and Dominik Simon, in addition prospects Urho Vaakanainen, Drew Helleson and Calle Clang.\u00a0 Anaheim's plummet over the last few months from a playoff position certainly helped Verbeek formulate his deadline strategy and it should pay off. The Ducks weren't in a position to win this season and were better off gaining prospects and draft capital than try and keep the band together for one more push this season.\u00a0 MORE:\u00a0Hampus Lindholm trade grades: Bruins pay price to solidify top four on defense The Blues seemed to be a team that was making calls in regards to every notable name, yet the best they came up with was Nick Leddy.\u00a0 Leddy's a fine defenseman to add, but St. Louis really needed to improve their left side on the blue line. Leddy is a slight upgrade over the likes of Jake Walman and Niko Mikkola, but he's not that impact player I think GM Doug Armstrong was hoping for.\u00a0 Not only that, but the return for Leddy seemed a bit much. Sundqvist is a solid bottom-six player and was very impactful in the team's Stanley Cup win in 2019. He would be a guy that any contender would like to have when trying to win a Cup, so giving him up is a head scratcher.\u00a0 If Leddy gets an extension to stay in St. Louis, perhaps that makes the deal more acceptable. But I don't think the Blues got that much better, especially in comparison to the teams around them.\u00a0 Joe Sakic missed out on Giroux, but he more than made up for it by adding three depth forwards and a top-four defenseman.\u00a0 The Avs brought in Josh Manson, Andrew Cogliano, Artturi Lehkonen and Nico Sturm. Manson helps a blue line that has dealt with injuries, with both Bowen Byram and Sam Girard out. Cogliano, Lehkonen and Sturm all can contribute to the Avs' bottom-six forward group in different ways. Cogliano is a veteran with playoff experience and has a good motor. Lehkonen is a promising younger player with offensive ability and given the cost of prospect Justin Barron, likely will be extended. Sturm has a big body and can play a good two-way game.\u00a0 They are the best team in hockey and gave up their future (they don't have a second-round pick until 2025) to win now.\u00a0 With an opportunity to make a significant move, the Coyotes' biggest moves of the deadline were trading away Scott Wedgewood and Johan Larsson. That's it.\u00a0 Arizona didn't have to ship out Jakob Chychrun and it's likely the two sides will revisit a potential trade again in the summer. With three years left on his contract, GM Bill Armstrong is in no rush to move him.\u00a0 However, there is absolutely zero reason why he should not have traded Phil Kessel. No, he's not the dynamic scoring winger he once was. But he's a pending free agent that would have made a great addition to a contender. Not only that, but Armstrong would at the very least be allowing a veteran to go have a chance at winning another Cup.\u00a0 It's a puzzling move for a Coyotes team set for a rebuild and in need of any and all draft capital.\u00a0 Minnesota's biggest concern heading into the back end of the season was goaltending. Not anymore.\u00a0 The Wild traded for Marc-Andre Fleury, giving them their clear-cut No. 1 in net. And all it cost was a conditional second-round pick that might turn into a first with certain scenarios playing out.\u00a0 I also like the additions of Tyson Jost and Nicolas Deslauriers. Jost was sent to the Wild to clear cap space and gives Minnesota a good offensive option on the fourth line. Deslauriers brings some toughness, grit and that's about it, but he's a pain in the butt to play against.\u00a0 GM Bill Guerin addressed the team's biggest need and potentially didn't have to give up a first-round pick. That's a win.\u00a0 MORE:\u00a0Marc-Andre Fleury trade grades: Wild get their No. 1 goalie; Blackhawks grant veteran his wish"

        "text": "The sweet land of Liberty has produced one of the 2022 NFL Draft's most intriguing prospects. Malik Willis is one of the most fascinating passers of the 2022 NFL Draft for a number of reasons. While his 2021 tape is uneven, Willis has all the traits that make NFL scouts drool. Willis is a well-built, cannon-armed quarterback with elite mobility to pair with his arm. NFL teams are drafting for traits more than they are for tried-and-true production at the college level in recent years, meaning Willis is going to be a very enticing prospect for a number of teams looking for a passer come April. Here's where he fits the best:\u00a0 NFL DRAFT 2022: SN's latest mock | Top 100 big board 1. Pittsburgh Steelers (No. 20) There's a good chance that if the Steelers want a QB, they'll have to trade up for the one they want, as is usually the case with teams who fall outside the top five.\u00a0 The Steelers, though, in a traditionally tough-as-nails NFC North, are going to need a massive shift in philosophy in the post Ben Roethlisberger era: The statuesque Roethlisberger paving way for Malik Willis would be welcome. The cannon-armed, mobile passer who would fit seamlessly into the AFC North arms race, a division that features killer defenses and elusive passers.\u00a0Willis is something of a project, but sitting on the bench behind Mitchell Trubisky \u2014 at least in the interim \u2014\u00a0 2. Seattle Seahawks (No. 9) With Russell Wilson out, the Seahawks are looking at Drew Lock as their Week 1 starter in the month leading up to the draft. Lock has played well in spurts, but no one will confuse him for franchise savior. With Wilson (and his love of the deep ball) gone, Pete Carroll can revert back to his smash-mouth, run-heavy style offense which he loves and won a Super Bowl with. That's not inherently a bad thing, especially for a young quarterback.\u00a0 With Lock rostered, the Seahawks benefit from the option of starting him until Willis is ready \u2014 whenever that may be. 3. Atlanta Falcons (No. 8) In truth, three of the four teams in the NFC South could be looking for a quarterback come April. (Thanks, Tom Brady.) Matt Ryan being shipped out means that Atlanta has a gaping hole at passer, and while some are out on the market \u2014 Baker Mayfield, Jimmy Garoppolo \u2014 it might be prudent for Atlanta to take a big swing on a talent of Willis' caliber.\u00a0 No doubt, shifting from the steady hand of Ryan to a rookie passer would result in growing pains, but Arthur Smith got the most out of what he had with some key players last season: Kyle Pitts had only one touchdown on the season, but had 1,026 receiving yards to go with it. Cordarrelle Patterson had a career year as a dual-threat player, as well. At his last stop, Smith got a lot out of Ryan Tannehill, and he hopes to rekindle a connection with Marcus Mariota in Hotlanta. But, getting a passer of the future would instantly put the Falcons in a better position than at least two of their division rivals, at least on paper. 4. Carolina Panthers (No. 6) The Panthers totally retooled their defense but have been struggling to find that next-level passer since Cam Newton's release just a few years ago. The Sam Darnold experiment was a colossal failure, both from a trade value standpoint and a production one. The short-lived 2021 reunion tour with Newton felt more of an effort to keep selling tickets as opposed to finding out if there was anything left in the tank, either. If Matt Rhule wants to keep an offensive coordinator \u2014 and his job past 2022 \u2014 then Step 1 is to find someone more than simply serviceable under center. Willis would give the Panthers their next, best shot at getting that next franchise passer. Given Rhule's desire to want to establish the run, as well, could help Willis settle in if he ends up in Carolina. 5. New York Giants (No. 5) New York has been pretty adamant that they're sticking with Daniel Jones for at least one more year. But, words are just words, and the fact remains that Jones isn't anyone's \"Guy\" in New York: With Brian Daboll named as the new head coach and Joe Schoen taking the keys to the GM office, Jones' clock runs on a different dial. With New York needing a massive jolt to its offense after the ill-fated Jason Garrett era, sticking a dynamic passer like Willis with the bright offensive mind of Daboll, who took a massive project in Josh Allen and helped mold him into a superstar, makes a lot of sense.\u00a0 The last thing the Giants should want to do is put themselves in a position to decide whether or not to give Jones a long-term extension based on one year of OK tape and a few years of flashes. Willis would provide a young, dynamic and moldable asset at the position while allowing the team to jettison Jones to the highest bidder, resetting the GM-QB-HC trio for the foreseeable future."

        "text": "The Colts guaranteed they would be moving onto their fifth different starting quarterback in as many seasons when they traded Carson Wentz earlier this month. Since then, there's been a lot of speculation as to who would be QB1. Now, we know who his replacement will be. Matt Ryan was traded by the Falcons to the Colts on Monday afternoon in exchange for a third-round pick. News of the deal was first reported by NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo. Trade!! The #Falcons are in agreement on a trade of QB Matt Ryan to the #Colts, per @MikeGarafolo, @TomPelissero and me. ATL gets a 3rd back.\n\nFallout from the Deshaun Watson situation, with Ryan starting over in Indy. Ryan gets a contract adjustment with more guaranteed money. The Colts are hopeful that Ryan, 37 in May, will be able to provide them with a multi-year answer at the quarterback position and make them a playoff contender once again. After all, Ryan is an established veteran and long-term NFL starter with a history of high-level success. He has just fallen on hard times in recent seasons while surrounded by a middling supporting cast. That may sound familiar to Colts fans. The situation is similar to when they took the veteran route during the 2020 NFL season and signed long-time Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to a one-year contract. Here's a breakdown of how the Ryan trade compares to the Rivers signing and what it might mean for the Colts. MORE: Why the Colts are the winners of the Matt Ryan trade Ryan and Rivers both had similar seasons in the year before they joined the Colts. The teams they were playing with struggled to win consistently as offensive line issues and defensive problems plagued both of them. Rivers' counting stats in the year before he went to Indianapolis are better than Ryan's. Rivers made more explosive plays with the Chargers than his counterpart did with the Falcons.\u00a0Of course, Rivers had at his disposal two top receivers in Keenan Allen and Mike Williams. Both players recorded 1,000-plus receiving yards in 2019 while Williams led the NFL in yards per catch at 20.4 thanks to his jump-ball ability. The performance of Allen and Williams helped Rivers post strong numbers, which allowed him to take more downfield chances. He was able to have more of a gunslinger mentality than Ryan could in Atlanta. Why? Because the Falcons traded away Julio Jones during the 2021 NFL offseason and Calvin Ridley left the team midway through the season due to personal reasons. As such, Ryan was throwing to Kyle Pitts, Russell Gage and Cordarrelle Patterson for most of the year. So, he wasn't able to take \u2014 or complete \u2014 as many downfield chances as Rivers. That said, Ryan was the more efficient passer. He completed a higher percentage of his passes and recorded eight fewer interceptions than Rivers. He also had a slightly better passer rating than his counterpart. All told, the two quarterbacks posted fairly similar numbers when taking into account the factors that impacted them during each season. So, it's easy to see why some will compare Ryan to Rivers even if their playing styles are slightly different. MORE:\u00a0Full details of the Matt Ryan trade Rivers' lone season with the Colts was a solid one. He led the team to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth as the No. 7 seed in the AFC. They didn't win a playoff game, but they gave the Bills, who made the AFC Championship Game, a run for their money. Rivers greatly improved his efficiency with Indianapolis. He threw nine fewer interceptions than he did with the Chargers the previous season while nearly maintaining the same yards-per-attempt clip. He also improved his completion percentage and posted the sixth-best passer rating in his 15 years as a starting quarterback. The one issue with Rivers is his arm strength wasn't consistent, which resulted in throwing certain deep balls that didn't have enough zip. That's part of the reason he decided to retire despite making it to the playoffs in 2021; the 39-year-old knew that his time as an effective starter was coming to an end. Rivers is the only Colts starting quarterback to lead the team to the playoffs since Andrew Luck retired. The team posted a 7-9 record when Jacoby Brissett was its primary starter and was 9-8 last year with Carson Wentz starting. IYER:\u00a0Grading the Deshaun Watson trade for the Browns If Rivers' performance with Indianapolis is any indication, then the Colts will likely be happy with Ryan. After all, Ryan is two years younger than Rivers was when he joined the Colts. As such, he should still have at least a couple of solid seasons left in the tank. Ryan may no longer be an MVP-type player like he was in 2016, but he is still an accurate passer with more than enough arm strength to distribute the ball to his playmakers. He will have more of those with the Colts than he did last year in Atlanta with Michael Pittman Jr. as an ascending receiver and Jonathan Taylor in the backfield as one of the NFL's best running backs. The Colts also currently have a better offensive line than the Falcons, with their only hole being at left tackle or right guard \u2014 depending on where they opt to use Matt Pryor. Luckily, the 2022 NFL Draft class is rich at tackle, and receiver, so the Colts can bolster these spots to give Ryan everything he needs to find success. It's also noteworthy that Ryan has preferred playing in a dome during his career. The Colts play at Lucas Oil Stadium, an indoor stadium, which will benefit Ryan. It would seem everything is lining up for Ryan to have a bounce-back season. He will likely post numbers similar to that of Rivers, though his yards per attempt may lag behind. Either way, though, he should be more consistent than Carson Wentz was in his 17 starts with the Colts last year."

        "text": "After 14 years, the Matt Ryan-era in Atlanta has come to an end. One of the most proficient quarterbacks in NFL history, Ryan was traded from the Falcons on Monday to the Colts\u00a0on Monday. Atlanta announced\u00a0it had sent Ryan to Indy for a third-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. Shortly after, the Falcons announced the signing of Marcus Mariota, inking the former Titans and Raiders' quarterback to a two-year contract. MATT RYAN TRADE GRADES:\u00a0Colts get stability at QB, Falcons pay the price for missing on Deshaun Watson Why did the Falcons decide to part ways with the most important player in the team's history? The Sporting News breaks down the decision. In recent days, a trade of Ryan became inevitable. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Ryan did not ask for a new contract with the Falcons and instead wanted to leave the team. Ryan, 36, has two years left on his current deal. The timing of the deal isn't coincidental, either. The Falcons had until Monday a 4 p.m. ET deadline for a $7.5 million roster bonus on Ryan's contract to be activated. The deadline had originally been slated for Friday, but it was pushed back as the team attempted to trade for Deshaun Watson. MORE: How Browns beat out Saints, Falcons to land Texans' QB \"Our goal in every decision is to improve our organization for the long term,\" general manager Terry Fontenot said in a statement. \"We believe today's agreement is the best long-term decision, not only for our organization, but also the best for Matt at this point, which is important for us. We wish he and his family the best in their next steps.\" And as Fontenot said, this decision comes with its benefits for the Falcons. Ryan is not getting any younger, and the Falcons would likely have a tough road to being competitive in the next two years. Ryan's salary was going to be a lot on the payroll over the next two seasons at $23.75 and $28 million, according to Spotrac. Now, the Falcons will have $40.525 million in dead cap space for Ryan, per Spotrac, the most in NFL history, but they will then be off the hook for his deal. Even with that cap hit, the Falcons saved more than $9 million, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero. That money will help pay for the two-year deal to sign Mariota. MORE:\u00a0Falcons back to square one after sending longtime quarterback to Colts Bringing in Mariota could be a worthy bridge for Atlanta as it decides what's next. Mariota worked with coach Arthur Smith in Tennessee, when Smith was a tight ends coach (2015-18) and offensive coordinator (2019) before Mariota left for Las Vegas. In his career, Mariota has passed for 13,437 yards with 77 touchdowns and 45 interceptions, while rushing 264 times for 1,574 yards and 13 scores on the ground. Signing Mariota gives Atlanta flexibility to look toward the future. The Falcons pick eighth in the draft, and could turn to quarterback options like Liberty's Malik Willis, Pitt's Kenny Pickett or Ole Miss' Matt Corral. They could also wait until 2023, when Alabama's Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Bryce Young or Ohio State's C.J. Stroud will be draft eligible. In either situation, a quarterback would have a chance to earn the starting spot from Mariota over time. The Falcons are still likely several years away from a realistic window to compete in the NFC, even playing in an NFC South that could \u2014 at some point \u2014 be without Tom Brady. Moving on from Ryan now starts the official rebuild window, with the team now setting its eyes on who the next signal-caller to lead the franchise will be."

        "text": "The AFC got stronger at the quarterback position once again on Monday. The Falcons and the Colts agreed to a trade that will send longtime Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan to Indianapolis for a 2022 third-round pick. News of the trade was first reported by NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo. Trade!! The #Falcons are in agreement on a trade of QB Matt Ryan to the #Colts, per @MikeGarafolo, @TomPelissero and me. ATL gets a 3rd back.\n\nFallout from the Deshaun Watson situation, with Ryan starting over in Indy. Ryan gets a contract adjustment with more guaranteed money. Ryan, 36, spent the first 14 seasons of his career with the Falcons. He was the No. 3 overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft out of Boston College and became one of the NFL's steadiest starters. He threw for at least 4,000 passing yards in four straight seasons and made it to four Pro Bowls during his time with the Falcons. In 2016, Ryan was named league MVP and led the Falcons to the Super Bowl, where they famously lost that game by blowing a 28-3 third-quarter lead to the Patriots. Since then, they have made it back to the playoffs just once in five seasons. Now, Ryan will hope to return to the postseason with the Colts, who missed out last season but believe themselves to be a quarterback away from being a contender. Who won the Matt Ryan trade? From the early looks of it, Indianapolis ended up on the right side of this deal. MORE: Full details of the Matt Ryan trade We can bemoan the fact that the Colts have had a different starting quarterback each year since Andrew Luck shockingly retired ahead of the 2019 NFL season. They have had turnover at the position and had a big swing and miss on the Carson Wentz trade just last offseason. Still, the Colts are getting a good deal by getting Ryan for only a third-round pick. He well may be the best quarterback they have had since Luck retired. You could make a case for Philip Rivers being better, but Ryan has a bit more zip on his passes now than Rivers did during his time with the Colts. As such, Ryan should be an upgrade for Indianapolis. Ryan also didn't cost much compared to other passers on the market. He even cost less than the package that the Colts received from Washington in exchange for Wentz, who netted the team two third-round picks and a pick-swap in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Wentz may be younger than Ryan, but the former Falcons starter is far more consistent than the mercurial Wentz. This isn't a perfect trade for the Colts by any means. After all, Ryan turns 37 in May and he posted the third-lowest air yards per attempt figure of his career in 2021. He could bounce back with better blocking \u2014 and remaining indoors at home is a plus for him \u2014 but his skill set could continue to decline as he ages. The bigger issue is about whether this makes the Colts true contenders in the AFC. Can they win the AFC South? Sure, they have the talent needed to do that. However, it's not guaranteed, and even if they win their division, can they compete with the likes of the Chiefs, Bengals, Bills, Chargers and Broncos in the playoffs? That's a major question mark. Ultimately, the deal is still a solid one for the Colts. Ryan is an upgrade for them and they didn't give up much to land him. However, the Colts aren't instant contenders after making this deal, so it's not a slam dunk. And if Ryan regresses, Indy could find itself back at the drawing board for a fifth consecutive offseason. IYER: Grading the Deshaun Watson trade for the Browns If you were looking for a crash course in how\u00a0not\u00a0to manage an offseason, look no further than the 2022 Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons spent the first week of free agency pursuing Deshaun Watson. They were one of four finalists for the embattled quarterback, but he went to the Browns instead. That left Atlanta hoping that Matt Ryan would want to remain with them despite their open courtship of Watson. Well, turns out that didn't happen. Ryan wanted to go elsewhere, so the Falcons offloaded him. All they could get for their troubles was a third-round pick. That's a far cry from what coach Arthur Smith previously said it would take to land Ryan ahead of the 2022 NFL Combine. \"We anticipate Matt being part of the team, but you don't ever back yourself into a corner,\" Smith said in early March, per\u00a0the Falcons' official website. \"If someone gives you an offer you can't refuse \u2014 Matt knows how we feel about him. Matt has a lot of good football left in him.\" The Falcons don't have anything at the quarterback position without Ryan. Their lone player under contract after trading Ryan was Feleipe Franks, who was an undrafted free agent out of Arkansas in 2021. They quickly changed that by signing Marcus Mariota to a two-year deal, but that doesn't eliminate the long-term questions they have at quarterback. Perhaps the team will address that by targeting a rookie quarterback \u2014 like Malik Willis or Kenny Pickett \u2014 in the 2022 NFL Draft. That said, the draft class is thought to be weak at the position, so Atlanta could wait to address the position until the following offseason. All told, the Falcons' pursuit of Watson backfired in a big way. They didn't have a ready-made succession plan for Ryan, so they will have to scramble to set one up after trading him. And they certainly didn't get a lot in return for their long-time starter."

Why? Because they agreed to a five-year, $87.5 million deal with him just ahead of the franchise tag deadline. Titans signed OLB Harold Landry to a 5-year, $87.5 million deal that includes $52.5M guaranteed, per source. 4 p.m. \u2014\u00a0The following players were slapped with the franchise tag ahead of the league's 4 p.m. ET deadline to apply the tag. 1:46 p.m. \u2014\u00a0Mike Williams and the Chargers agreed to a three-year contract extension worth $60 million, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports it will make Rodgers the highest paid player in the NFL based on average annual value. The #Packers and MVP QB Aaron Rodgers have agreed to terms on a 4-year, $200M deal that makes him the highest paid player in NFL history, sources say.

        "text": "The Browns have gone all in on trying to maximize their chances to win a Super Bowl in the near future. Cleveland traded first-round picks in 2022, 2023 and 2024, a third-round pick in 2023 and fourth-round picks in 2022 and 2024 in exchange for quarterback Deshaun Watson and a 2024 sixth-round pick. If Watson returns to his 2020 form after missing all of last season and is able to play in 2022, the switch from Baker Mayfield to Watson solidifies Cleveland's position as a legitimate Super Bowl contender. However, it didn't seem this would always be the case. The Browns had been told they were out on Watson, and not long after, Mayfield requested a trade from the organization. Cleveland initially denied the request until Watson changed his mind. MORE:\u00a0Browns explain, defend decision to acquire Deshaun Watson Now, the Browns have Watson and no longer have a need for Mayfield. The biggest problem? Most teams previously in the market for a QB have already made their move. With the quarterback market quickly drying up, what can the Browns reasonably expect to get for Mayfield? Giving up three first-round draft picks is a major gamble, and the Browns clearly wanted to recoup at least one back in trying to flip Mayfield. That looks unlikely. At this point, it feels they'll be lucky to salvage anything more than a late-round pick. According to Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer, teams heard that Cleveland was asking for a first-round pick in exchange for the former No. 1 overall pick. He also noted that the 49ers are seeking two second-round picks for Jimmy Garoppolo, the other major name still on the trade block.\u00a0 As Breer wrote, the Browns are going to have to lower their expectations. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, via reporter Dov Kleiman, one team asked for the Browns to add a pick with Mayfield just for the other team to take his contract. MORE: NFL free agency tracker 2022 Finding the right return for Mayfield is going to be difficult for Cleveland due to a number of reasons. First off, his contract situation. Mayfield is owed $18.858 million in 2022 as part of his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season. That gives teams a quarterback who is both expensive and doesn't have a guarantee beyond the 2022 season. So if the move doesn't work out, it's a lot of money to risk. If Mayfield improves with his new team, that team would have no ability to secure his services before he reaches free agency. And while that new team could ink him to an extension after trading him, there's no telling where his value is at. Which brings us to the second issue. Mayfield had a standout rookie season, when he had 27 touchdowns and only 14 interceptions with a 63.8 completion percentage. He took regressed in his second year, tossing 22 touchdowns and 21 interceptions. Mayfield bounced back in Year 3, leading the Browns to the playoffs and nearly to the AFC Championship. He finished with 26 touchdowns, eight interceptions, a 62.8 completion percentage and 3,563 yards. In 2021, he was hampered by a shoulder injury that has since required offseason surgery. While playing through that shoulder injury, he took yet another step back, completing only 60.5 percent of his passes with 17 touchdowns, 13 interceptions and 3,010 passing yards. The 2018 first overall pick will be just 27 during the season and could return to that 2020 level, but it's uncertain. Mayfield's unsteady play combined with his recovery from shoulder surgery clouds any projection moving forward. MORE: How Browns beat out Saints, Falcons to land Texans' QB The third issue is that several potential vacancies have been filled already. The Commanders acquired Carson Wentz from the Colts, who then\u00a0acquired Matt Ryan\u00a0from the Falcons. The Falcons immediately signed Marcus Mariota to a two-year deal. The Broncos acquired Russell Wilson from the Seahawks who received Drew Lock in return. The Packers re-signed Aaron Rodgers. The Buccaneers got Tom Brady back after a 39-day retirement. The Saints re-signed Jameis Winston.\u00a0And the Texans didn't want Mayfield.\u00a0 The musical chairs leaves few viable trade partners for both the Browns and the 49ers, who are still looking to offload Garoppolo.\u00a0 Although Seattle brought Lock back in the Wilson trade, it could emerge as a potential suitor for Mayfield, though that's far from a given. Perhaps the Buccaneers are interested in Mayfield as the long-term replacement for Brady once he actually decides to retire for good. The Panthers already have to pay Darnold's $18.858 fifth-year option in 2022 and likely won't want to add Mayfield to that list unless they can find somewhere to trade Darnold. Such a move involves Carolina navigating the same problems now facing Cleveland. Then there are the trades for Wentz and Ryan. The Colts received several 2022 second- and third-round picks and a conditional third-round pick that could be a second-round pick in 2022 if Wentz plays at least 70 percent of the team's snaps. However, Wentz came with a 2022 second and seventh, helping to balance out the picks dealt. Ryan cost the Colts only a third-round pick. MORE: Why the Falcons traded Matt Ryan to Colts, signed Marcus Mariota to start a new era While both Ryan and Wentz are expensive, both are also locked up over longer deals and both are coming off better 2021 seasons than Mayfield. And since Mayfield has come into the league, 2020 was the only year in which he had a better QBR than either Ryan or Wentz. This is to say that if any team was going to look at the Ryan or Wentz deals for a possible model at how much to pay for Mayfield, the end result is still likely not a high value for Mayfield. So just how much should the Browns expect to receive for Mayfield? The answer is probably not much. If they can get a pick at all, that would have to feel like a win. This late in the game, the market just isn't there for Mayfield, and it's unlikely the teams that could use him most are going to be feeling desperate to give up much for him."

        "text": "LeBron James captured headlines everywhere at 2022 NBA All-Star weekend in Cleveland with his quote about wanting to finish his career playing alongside his son. \u201cMy last year will be played with my son,\u201d James told The Athletic's Jason Lloyd. \u201cWherever Bronny is at, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be. I would do whatever it takes to play with my son for one year. It\u2019s not about the money at that point.\u201d James, 37, is still averaging 29.7 points per game in his 19th season in the NBA. He doesn't look like he's slowing down any time soon, meaning he'll almost certainly still be a major factor by the time his son, Bronny, is ready for the NBA. Bronny James Jr. just wrapped up his junior season at the powerhouse Los Angeles prep high school, Sierra Canyon. The excerpt from his dad sent the NBA world into a frenzy, wondering everything from, \"When is LeBron's son NBA Draft-eligible?\" to \"How good is LeBron's son?\" or \"Will LeBron's son even make the NBA?\" We have answers to all of those questions below. NBA LEAGUE PASS: Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial) Age:\u00a017 (turns 18 in October 2022) Height, weight:\u00a06-3, 190 lbs. Class of 2023 rank: 43rd (four-star) on ESPN's Top 60 It has been an unorthodox high school career for James to this point. He played in every game for Sierra Canyon as a freshman but the coronavirus pandemic delayed the start of his sophomore year.\u00a0Even though games weren't being played at the time, James tore his meniscus in February of his sophomore season, requiring surgery. When the shortened season tipped off in the Spring, James hadn't recovered yet but eventually suited up for Sierra Canyon in the postseason. His junior year was his first full season back from injury, but playing\u00a0alongside ESPN Top 100-level seniors like No. 2-ranked, five-star UCLA commit Amari Bailey and four-star prospects like USC commit Kijani Wright and Nebraska commit Ramel Lloyd, James wasn't always in the limelight the way you might expect. He had some highs like an 18-point performance against an elite Chicago school, Glenbard West. He also had his lows, like being held scoreless when Sierra Canyon was eliminated in the California state tournament (CIF Southern Section Open). The best way to describe Bronny's role on this Sierra Canyon team: He was a perennial starter and elite perimeter defender but played a reserved offensive role as a shooter and secondary scorer and playmaker. As a 6-3 17-year-old, James already has good size and when you consider LeBron is 6-8, it's probably safe to assume he'll grow even more by the time he enters the draft process. He doesn't have the wingspan his father does, but Bronny already uses his quick feet and strength to his advantage on the defensive end, shutting off opposing drives with ease. He has good hands and keen instincts to fill passing lanes, turning defense into offense in a hurry with his breakaway speed or savvy passing ability to run in transition. \"Feel for the game\" is something you'll commonly read when it comes to Bronny and I believe that intangible skill will come to the forefront when he gets a chance to take over as a team's primary offensive initiator. James can play either the one or the two, but he spent most of this season as an off-ball scorer and shooter. His jumpshot mechanics are smooth, but you will notice his release is a bit slow. He didn't shoot all that consistently during his junior season, but he does have range and he can also knock down jumpers off the dribble. Bronny James has NBA range. \ud83d\udd25\n\npic.twitter.com/EgsgJw5ruA He has flashes where he shows his burst and athleticism to go downhill and get to the rim, but he doesn't attack as often as he could. He's an ambidextrous finisher and has steady body control. As he grows into his body, don't be surprised to see James get aggressive and put pressure on the rim more often. Bronny James. \ud83d\udd25\n\npic.twitter.com/hATE4pxF3l There is still a lot to be determined when it comes to the type of player Bronny could be.\u00a0As you would expect from the son of arguably the greatest player of all time, the skill and IQ are already in place. The next step is fine-tuning those tools and growing his game as his body becomes more developed. As mentioned above, he is currently a four-star recruit and the 43rd-ranked player in his high school class. How he performs in his final AAU circuit this spring and summer will make a significant impact on his ranking going into his senior high school season. James will first be eligible for the NBA Draft in 2024. He will be an 18-year-old senior at Sierra Canyon next season in 2022-23. It has not yet been determined where James will play once he graduates from high school and there are a number of different routes young prospects can go to get to the NBA these days. From the NCAA to the G League Ignite to Australia's NBL Next Stars program and more, a handful of prospects have paved their own unique path to the NBA after high school in recent years. Should he go the NCAA route, ESPN's recruiting platform currently has Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina and UCLA as schools interested in James, with Kentucky being his lone offer. That list will undoubtedly grow after his final summer of AAU hoops in the coming months.\u00a0"

        "text": "\"Winning\" in NFL free agency is not about quantity, but quality. It's also not always about the new players a team signed or acquired in a trade, it's often about what key players it was able to keep. Another measure of success is a team knowing itself, whether it is positioned as a rebuilder or contender and whether the moves it has made works in conjunction with the status or is futile spending. Keeping all that in mind with the early but busy action on the NFL's open market in the 2022 offseason, here's The Sporting News' grades and rankings for how every team has done with personnel decisions before the draft next month: NFL DRAFT 2022: SN's latest mock | Top 100 big board 1. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Grade: A+ The Bucs retained Tom Brady after his brief flirtation with retirement and found a way to keep their key pieces intact (minus Leonard Fournette and Rob Gronkowski for now) to remain formidable Super Bowl contenders. 2. Buffalo Bills Grade: A Miller was a surprise coup for this strong AFC championship contender. The Bills reloaded their defensive line rotation and worked patiently to find depth elsewhere. 3. Cleveland Browns Grade: A Unless Watson is suspended by the NFL for a significant portion of the 2022 season, the Browns upgraded from Baker Mayfield on the field and are back in the conversation for AFC title contention, too. Cooper was a nice new No. 1 to get for their new franchise QB, too. MORE: Ranking the best NFL free agents still available 4. Los Angeles Chargers Grade: A Let\u2019s throw down the Chargers as another AFC contender that spent its resources well to take advantage of Justin Herbert\u2019s rookie contract. Jackson and Mack can be an incredible new 1-2 punch for Brandon Staley\u2019s defense. 5. Las Vegas Raiders Grade: A The Raiders gave Derek Carr a dominant No. 1 to strengthen their playoff status in a very tough AFC West. Jones is a nice complement to Maxx Crosby, too. There\u2019s smart spending here overall from the new ex-Patriots braintrust. 6. Tennessee Titans Grade: A The Titans weren\u2019t looking all that good early in free agency, but then Hooper and Woods became the ideal offensive skill players available to boost Derrick Henry and Ryan Tannehill. They\u2019re looking great in the AFC South again, especially when keeping Landry. 7. New York Jets Grade: A Joe Douglas and Robert Saleh didn\u2019t go nuts with the spending but were very calculated in the needed upgrades for the defense and offense with great draft capital ahead to continue the expedited turnaround centered around Zach Wilson. 8. Indianapolis Colts Grade: A The Colts were sitting on a lot of money but have slow-played free agency under sometimes-aggressive GM Chris Ballard, who waited patiently to upgrade from Wentz to Ryan at QB. 9. Miami Dolphins Grade: A Keeping Ogbah and Gesicki was a great start and then they loaded up Mike McDaniel with several key versatile pieces and a better backup to Tua Tagovailoa in Bridgewater. 10. Cincinnati Bengals Grade: A The AFC champions had to be careful with spending with a big contract for Joe Burrow just around the corner. They did good value work on the offensive line, the biggest need, and kept some key role players under Duke Tobin. 11. Seattle Seahawks Grade: A- The Seahawks were a last-place team with Wilson, so they had to move their unhappy QB and got tremendous return for him. They were able to give themselves some flexibility to spend elsewhere and save big at the most important position in their necessary hastened rebuild for Pete Carroll and John Schneider. 12. Arizona Cardinals Grade: A- The Cardinals had to get younger after being the oldest team based on average player age last season. It also looks like the Kyler Murray drama has cooled for Steve Keim and Kliff Kingsbury and they re-signed the right guys without overspending based on their cap situation. 13. Los Angeles Rams Grade: B Les Snead and Sean McVay had an interesting follow to winning the Super Bowl, taking some expected hits. Losing Miller hurts, but they upgraded wide receiver and kept the offensive line strong. 14. Philadelphia Eagles Grade: B The Eagles had to work some good cap magic with extended GM Howie Roseman and still got one of the most impactful free agents in former Temple star Reddick. They also moved on from fading players. 15. Washington Commanders Grade: B Wentz is a bit of a gamble but does potentially stabilize QB for Ron Rivera and Scott Turner based on how well he can do in the system. The offensive line, defensive line, secondary and wide receiver corps required a collective shakeup and that happened. 16. Atlanta Falcons Grade: B The Falcons enter a new era after trading Matt Ryan and now have a chance to start fresh by drafting his replacement to develop behind Mariota. Hayward was a nice get given their tough cap spot. 17. Jacksonville Jaguars Grade: B The Jaguars get this grade more of their defensive quality in the midst of all the quantity, as their offensive moves remained questionable based on the lack of value to help Trevor Lawrence under Doug Pederson and Trent Baalke. 18. San Francisco 49ers Grade: B The 49ers took some hits on the offensive and defensive lines but John Lynch did some good work on the back seven of the defense to mitigate some of that. The big remaining question is whether they can successful deal Jimmy Garoppolo, harder now with the Colts getting Ryan. 19. Denver Broncos Grade: B- The Broncos are doing their best to build a championship potential roster for Russell Wilson, but they aren\u2019t there yet and gave up a lot key draft resources and a couple key veterans, too. There's a good chance they remain the fourth-best team in a loaded AFC West. 20. Pittsburgh Steelers Grade: B- The Steelers worked on their offensive line, linebacker and secondary issues and also got a contingency at QB in Trubisky. Per usual, their bread and butter for big improvement is the draft. 21. Dallas Cowboys Grade: B- The Cowboys had to get creative to keep some preferred contracts and took real hits at wide receiver, offensive line and defense. They came out OK given they were bound to lose something significant with their cap situation. 22. Baltimore Ravens Grade: B- The Ravens had limited means for improving their team going in but managed to solve a big issue at safety by splurging on Williams. Moses proves good swing depth with Villanueva retiring. 23. Detroit Lions Grade: B- The Lions kept some so-so talent and Chark was their notable young veteran signing in lieu of being all about the youth movement in the draft. They\u2019ve been a solid rebuilding team, but far short of spectacular. 24. Kansas City Chiefs Grade: C The Chiefs downgraded by going from Mathieu to Reid and also took another considerable secondary hit in Ward. Smith-Schuster is intriguing in the offense. But Kansas City got little edge here compared to their very active division opponents, who gained ground. 25. Green Bay Packers Grade: C The Packers did everything for Aaron Rodgers only to need to pass on re-signing Adams. Campbell was the priority to keep over the others with little money to spend. 26. New England Patriots Grade: C New England\u2019s typical exodus of particular veterans vs. the others wasn\u2019t inspiring given how well Buffalo, Miami and New York did in the division. They\u2019re for a status quo team at best in Year 2 of Mac Jones. 27. Minnesota Vikings Grade: C The Vikings committed to Kirk Cousins more on an extended deal as their most notable pre-draft move with a new coach and GM combination of Kevin O\u2019Connell and Kwesi Adofo-Memsah. They are slowly retooling for new leadership but lost a lot in the process. 28. New Orleans Saints Grade: C The Saints started free agency trying to dig out of salary-cap hell and then threw a lot into Maye downgrading for Williams. They ended it with bigger QB questions after failing to land Watson. 29. New York Giants Grade: C The Giants couldn\u2019t do much with their new coach and GM combination of Brian Daboll and Joe Schoen. The offensive line pickups help, but there\u2019s not much to see here ahead of the team having two high first-rounders in the draft. 30. Chicago Bears Grade: C- The Bears were another weak performing team in free agency as it feels like GM Ryan Poles is pushing to be fully committed to a massive rebuilding situation across the roster. 31. Carolina Panthers Grade: D The Panthers also lost on Watson and are committing more to Sam Darnold. They\u2019ve worked a little at the offensive line, but they seem to be all over the place in the questionable plans of Scott Fitterer and Matt Rhule. 32. Houston Texans Grade D The Texans seem like they\u2019re just shuffling around average players under Nick Caserio and Lovie Smith to field a passable starting team. The whole Watson debacle can\u2019t be forgotten in stamping their personnel acquiring dysfunction."

        "text": "The madness of March has returned in full force. Already, two of the top five teams with the best odds to win the 2022 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament has been eliminated. Kentucky was knocked out in the first round, and No. 1 Baylor was taken out in the second round of the tournament. Several other heavy favorites remain in the field, however. Gonzaga, Arizona, Kansas and Duke have all survived to the round of 16, keeping alive the hopes of many brackets that picked the high-seeded programs to go deep . TSN's MARCH MADNESS HQ\nLive NCAA bracket\u00a0|\u00a0TV schedule\u00a0|\u00a0Predictor tool At this point, every bracket has at least one blemish \u2014 and likely a few others \u2014 but there's still hope to win that bracket pool. Each game from the Sweet 16 forward will be worth more points, meaning there is still hope for brackets to make big comebacks and win their pools. There's also bettors that will be looking at the Sweet 16 as a chance to put down some more money on teams to advance to the Elite Eight and beyond.\u00a0 With that, The Sporting News is taking a look at the betting odds and model projections for teams to reach the Elite Eight. The Sporting News is running a projection model that looks into the field and which teams are the most likely to come out of each matchup. The model is based on a composite ranking from the\u00a0Pomeroy\u00a0and\u00a0Sagarin\u00a0ratings, two of the top college basketball ranking systems, along with offensive and defensive stats and ratings based on teams' game-by-game results throughout the 2021-22 season. The model then runs a Monte Carlo simulation of the tournament 20,000 times and derives the outcomes from the result of each simulation. Here is a look at the current odds and model projections for teams to advance past the Sweet 16 in the 2022 NCAA tournament. All odds are courtesy of Sports Interaction. The teams with the best odds to win a championship has not changed too much since the start of the tournament. Gonzaga remains the major favorite to win \u2014 with their odds only going up \u2014 while Arizona, Duke and Kansas also help round out the top five. The biggest change is that Kentucky, which entered as the second-best odds to win it all, was eliminated in the first round and the East's No. 1 seed, Baylor, was also knocked out, paving the way for No. 3 Purdue to enter the top five at +900. The Sporting News model is similar, but is not nearly as high on Duke. Here's a look at how the model views the rest of the tournament shaking out, with percentages converted to odds. The biggest difference between the oddsmakers and the model is Duke. The model gives the Blue Devils just a 5.2 percent chance of winning it all (+1834 odds). The model views Duke as about an even bet to beat Texas Tech and as a major underdog against Gonzaga (Bulldogs would have a 66 percent chance to win in a head-to-head clash), if it should move past that round. As for Kansas and Arizona, it views the team as similar and would give Arizona a 53.1 percent chance of winning in a head-to-head matchup, but the model sees Kansas' road to the Final Four as easier compared to Arizona's. The model looks at Purdue as having the best odds of reaching the Elite Eight of any remaining team and third-best odds of reaching the Final Four, but it predicts Gonzaga has a 67.6 percent chance of beating the Boilermakers, if the teams match up. Here's how the model views the field overall.  Here is a look at the odds and projections for each team to advance to the Elite Eight and beyond. Purdue has already faced the most turmoil of any of the four regions, but the oddsmakers suggest that that will end now. Purdue is the highest remaining seed, and the odds have it as the third-best team to reach the Final Four. That starts with the Boilermakers being the heaviest favorite to reach the Elite Eight in the field, as bookmakers believe the Cinderella run for the Peacocks will come to an end. The model follows the odds fairly closely. It sees Purdue as a strong bet to beat the Peacocks and sees UCLA as a slight favorite to beat UNC. However, the model would predict UCLA as a slight favorite to beat Purdue (51.4 percent), while Purdue would have a 62.8 percent chance to beat UNC. The reason Purdue has the better odds to reach the Final Four than UCLA? UCLA has the tougher Sweet 16 path compared to Purdue. Kansas has one of the easiest paths to the championship game, and oddsmakers view them as both favorites to win against Providence in the Sweet 16 and emerge out of the Midwest region in the Final Four. Kansas was always viewed as the favorite to come out of the Midwest. With No. 2 Auburn, No. 3 Wisconsin, No. 5 Iowa and No. 6 LSU, the path looks significantly easier. Coming into the tournament, bookmakers had Providence as having worse odds to reach the Final Four than the fifth and sixth seeds and equal odds to No. 8 San Diego State. If Kansas beats Providence, it then has to get past a double-digit seed. Whether it's Miami or Iowa State, expect the Jayhawks to be heavy favorites again. The model views Kansas' upcoming game against Providence as the biggest challenge remaining. The Jayhawks would have a 75.4 percent chance of beating Miami and a 74.4 percent chance of beating Iowa State, as of right now. Should Providence beat Kansas, it would be picked as a 50.6 percent favorite against Iowa State and a 55.4 percent favorite against Miami. There are three teams in the South region that each stand a strong chance of advancing to the Final Four. Bookmakers aren't looking too favorably at the 11-seeded Wolverines. Arizona and Villanova are favorites to advance to the Elite Eight, and Houston\u00a0and Villanova\u00a0are about equal to reach the Final Four. In essence, the oddsmakers think Villanova has the easiest\u00a0path to the Elite Eight, Arizona is the best team remaining in the region and Houston is just behind Arizona. This is about how the model sees the region playing out. It has both the Arizona-Houston matchup as a toss-up, while giving the edge to Villanova against Michigan. The model would give Houston a 57.9 percent chance of beating Villanova, and it would put Arizona as a 56.9 percent favorite to beat Villanova. Michigan's chances of advancing past Villanova are already long, and it would again be a heavy underdog against either team in the next round. Arizona and Houston would both have a 69.9 percent chance to beat Michigan. Gonzaga remains the heavy favorite to win the national championship, and as such, oddsmakers don't like the chances for the rest of the teams in the bracket. Only the Midwest region has longer odds for the non-favorites than the ones set for the rest of the West. Duke and Texas Tech are about even to reach the Final Four, but Arkansas has the third-worst odds to advance to the Final Four of any team and well below all the other top four seeds. Interestingly, Duke is a slight underdog against Texas Tech, but has better odds to win a national championship than the Red Raiders. That might well be a nod to the respect given to coach Mike Krzyzewski by both bookmakers and bettors, who feel Coach K could go out on a high note. The model has Gonzaga as a major favorite to advance out of the Sweet 16, past the Final Four and into the championship. It has Duke and Texas Tech as about even, while giving the Red Raiders a slight edge the rest of the way to reach the Final Four and championship. Gonzaga would be favored over Duke at 67 percent and Texas Tech at 65 percent, while Arkansas would be underdogs to Duke (61.8 percent) and Texas Tech (61.4 percent)."

        "text": "March Madness has lived up to its name so far in 2022. There were upsets galore in the first two rounds of the 2022 NCAA Tournament, and ahead of the Sweet 16, college basketball fans and bettors alike are wondering which Cinderellas will continue their runs to the Final Four. The Sweet 16 has four double-digit seeds in it: Miami (10), Michigan (11), Iowa State (11) and Saint Peters (15). All four teams have pulled off multiple upsets and have combined to knock off title-favorites like Auburn, Kentucky and Tennessee. Additionally, No. 8 seed UNC has advanced to the Sweet 16 after knocking out the defending champion Baylor Bears in Round 2 of the tournament. Bettors may have had their confidence shaken if they had the likes of Baylor, Kentucky and other eliminated teams to win the tournament. Still, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about the upcoming Sweet 16 games, as a dive into the odds reveals some favorable matchups and point spreads of which savvy bettors can take advantage. What are the best bets for the Sweet 16? Sporting News has you covered with some top trends, advice and picks to take a chance on as March Madness heads towards its second weekend. TSN's MARCH MADNESS HQ\nLive NCAA bracket\u00a0|\u00a0TV schedule\u00a0|\u00a0Predictor tool Below are the opening March Madness odds for the Sweet 16,\u00a0including point spreads, money lines and over-under totals for every game, via Sports Interaction Sportsbook. BENDER: Winners and losers from March Madness' wild first weekend This is a low spread, but this still seems like a great spot in which to bet the underdog. Houston has been excellent against the spread this season, as their cover percentage of 66.7 percent (24-12 ATS) ranks fifth-best in the NCAA. They have only been an underdog once during the 2021-22 season, and that came in a one-point loss against Alabama. The Cougars have covered the spread in nine of their last 10 games. Those have all come as favorites of at least 3.5 points, so they shouldn't have any issue covering as an underdog, even against a great Arizona team. Besides, the Wildcats haven't looked impenetrable in the NCAA Tournament so far. No. 9 seed TCU nearly knocked them off in Round 2 while 16-seed Wright State kept it close in Round 1. They are 5-7 ATS in their last 12, so Houston should have a chance to cover even at this margin. It wouldn't be a surprise to see the Cougars win this game outright either. They ranked No. 3 in the NET ratings and No. 2 in the KenPom, so they were clearly under-seeded entering the tournament. As such, betting the Houston moneyline +109\u00a0isn't a bad choice for daring bettors. The Houston moneyline may look appealing, but the underdog in the other 2-point s spread game is just a bit more appealing. UNC should have a great chance to beat UCLA in the Sweet 16 matchup between the two blue blood programs. Why? The Bruins will simply have a tough time matching up with the Tar Heels, especially on the boards. Armando Bacot and UNC are one of the best rebounding teams in the NCAA Tournament and have logged a plus-24 rebound differential in their first two contests. Meanwhile, UCLA has just a plus-2 differential despite playing weaker competition than the Tar Heels, who blew out Marquette and defeated No. 1 seed Baylor. Obviously, rebounding isn't the\u00a0only\u00a0thing that matters, but UNC is 26-6 straight up this year when they don't lose the rebound battle while they are 0-3 when they do use it. So, unless UCLA can force UNC into enough misses\u00a0and clean the glass well, it could end up being a longer day for them than expected. I know, I know. You're scared to bet against the Peacock. Furthermore, you probably don't want to. Who doesn't love a good Cinderella story? Well, so much as we love Saint Peters' story, the plucky underdog is facing an uphill battle in the Sweet 16. The Peacocks are just the third No. 15 seed in history to make it to this point in the tournament, but none have ever made it to the Elite Eight. So, history would tell us that Saint Peters is unlikely to win this one. That rings true when you look at the matchup, too. Purdue is one of the strongest teams in the NCAA Tournament and they have something that the Peacocks will have trouble dealing with: size. The Boilermakers sport what is arguably the best center rotation in college basketball. Their starter is 7-4 Canadian Zach Edey, who averages 14.5 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game in just 19.1 minutes per contest. When he comes out of the game, Trevion Williams, a 6-10 big man who made the All-Big Ten team in 2021, enters. Both Edey and Williams have played well during March Madness. Edey has averaged a double-double while Williams scored a team-high 22 points in Purdue's win over Texas. Saint Peters simply doesn't have the size to compete with them, as their biggest regular player, Clarence Rupert, is 6-8. Edey could feast as a result, so don't be afraid to back Purdue as double-digit favorites. MORE: How Saint Peters compares to other 15 seeds to make the Sweet 16 If you're either a Duke or UNC fan, pairing the two schools together in a parlay may not be your favorite move. That said, there's good reason to believe that both of these contests will have a chance to hit the over. The UNC vs. UCLA contest features two of the best offenses in the nation squaring off. The Tar Heels average 78.5 points per game, good for 17th best in the country, while the Bruins at\u00a075.7 points per game are tied for 41st in the country. Both teams possess strong starting lineups that are capable of posting big outings at any time. So far during the NCAA Tournament, UNC is averaging 94 points per game and has been one of the most efficient offenses during the tournament. Meanwhile, UCLA scored 72 points against Saint Mary's after being uncharacteristically cold in their opener against Akron and scoring just 57 points. Provided that neither team goes cold on Friday, the over should hit. Meanwhile, Duke is one of the highest-scoring teams in college basketball, as they average 80.3 points per game, good for the sixth-most in the country. The Blue Devils have played in just six games with a point total under 140 and the over is 5-1 in those contests. Some may be scared off by Texas Tech's top-five scoring defense. However, it's worth noting that the Red Raiders has faced a top-15 scoring offense four times during the season and the over is 3-1 in those contests. Upset special parlays can\u00a0really\u00a0pay off if you're able to hit the right combination of teams. Both Houston and UNC seemingly have a chance to beat their Sweet 16 opponents in upset fashion, so why not combine them into a parlay if you're already thinking about betting them? As mentioned, Houston is one of the most under-seeded teams in the 2022 NCAA Tournament, as they had a legitimate case to be a No. 2 seed. Instead, they ended up on the 5-line but have beaten UAB and trounced Illinois on route to a meeting with Arizona. The Wildcats are arguably the most talented team in the NCAA Tournament, but they are light on tournament experience. They also have a first-year head coach in Tommy Lloyd. After their close call against TCU, it's easy to see them falling against Houston. Meanwhile, UNC has a first-year coach in Hubert Davis, but they aren't heaped with the same expectations as Arizona. They weren't expected to beat Baylor, so anything more of this tournament run is gravy. They match up very well with UCLA scoring-wise and should outrebound them significantly to position themselves for a win. You can bet UNC alone, but combining them in Houston creates a +337 parlay. That payout of nearly 3.4-1 is well worth the risk."

        "text": "Stop me if you've heard this before \u2014 RJ Barrett has come out of the All-Star break on fire. Barrett catapulted out of the All-Star break with a purpose in his rookie season that was shortened due to the pandemic, after struggling to find some consistency with his shot in the first half of 2019-20. He did it again last season, surging post-All-Star break to help the Knicks secure home-court advantage in the playoffs. NBA\u00a0League\u00a0Pass:\u00a0Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial) This year, under much different circumstances, he's one of the few bright spots in an hugely disappointing Knicks' season. Since this year's All-Star break in Cleveland, Barrett is averaging 26.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists, placing him in elite company alongside the game's biggest stars. His recent scoring bursts have put him in range of finishing the season at or above the 20.0 point per game mark for the first time in his career. And that's right in line with his growth. In an age where we rush to forget the moment talent doesn't translate right from the jump, it's worth a reminder that Barrett is still only 21 years old. He's had immense pressure resting on his shoulders both from north of the border and in New York as fans impatiently wait for him to turn into the star he was promised to be. Knicks fans entered the 2019 Draft lottery with visions of Zion Williamson or Ja Morant. The ping pong balls bounced and landed with the Knicks owning the third pick in a two-star draft. Nearly three years later, Barrett is showing all the signs that he is far more than a consolation prize. Three years into his NBA career, Barrett's right on track. Coming into the league, many scouting reports questioned Barrett's explosiveness and ability to score over length. In his rookie year, he didn't do much to dispel those claims, as he struggled to finish around size at the rim and seemingly avoided contact and trips to the charity stripe. Now? It all seems like a thing of the past. Barrett has put the work in in the offseason, becoming a more explosive finisher in the half court and welcoming trips to the free throw line. Barrett has upped his average this season to a career-high 5.3 free throw attempts per game, which is more in line with some of the game's best scorers like Bradley Beal, Zach LaVine and Devin Booker. Getting to the line regularly has allowed him to find a rhythm and manufacture points when nothing else is working. It's allowed him to be a run stopper when the Knicks are on the wrong side of a quick burst. It's helped punish opposing defenses for paying too much attention to Julius Randle. It's allowed him to show the uber confidence he has in himself and his game. MORE: NBA Mock Draft 2022: Who goes No.1? Chet Holmgren, Paolo Banchero or Jabari Smith \u201cThere are steps that you take, and people forget that he\u2019s 21 years old,\" Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau told reporters\u00a0via the NY Post. \"He\u2019s learning, he\u2019s got a great work capacity. He\u2019s done everything we\u2019ve asked of him and he continues to get better. I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. I think he\u2019s just built that way. So it\u2019s a big plus for us.\u201d Outside of the foul shooting, Barrett has become savvier on the offensive end. As a rookie, Barrett often rushed to make decisions or would change his mind last minute often leaving his feet to make an awful jump pass. That's slowly becoming a thing of the past and it shows in the way he's been attacking teams off of handoffs. According to NBA Stats tracking data, Barrett\u00a0ranked in the 20th percentile\u00a0in handoff efficiency as a rookie. In his second season, that number was even worst as Barrett ranked\u00a0in the 16th percentile. This season, Barrett ranks in the\u00a077th percentile, generating 1.05 points per possession. When you watch the tape, you see the growth in real-time. In a recent game against the Jazz, Barrett displayed his newfound effectiveness in running handoffs. This play is almost a Barrett cheat code as he comes off multiple screens to accept the handoff on his strong side and powers his way to the rim with a tough finish. Later in the period, he catches his defender cheating on the handoff and strokes a confident triple. Later in the game, he comes off the handoff on his weak side, shows patience and finds a pocket for a floater. He doesn't make it, but that's not the point. Rookie Barrett wouldn't have gotten off such a great look. The Knicks will continue to find ways to get Barrett in favorable spots offensively and that should help him continue to score at a high clip. Barrett will also continue to find ways to improve his game and get an edge as teams look for ways to slow him down. All in all, the growth we've seen from RJ Barrett since he entered the league is palpable. The ceiling is still high for Barrett. It won't be long before he finally turns into the player he was promised to be."

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\tThe ARTnews Recommends Editors\n Steamers are a wonderful alternative to ironing, ideal for artists working with large-scale textile artworks that are prone to wrinkling. Within minutes, wrinkles disappear from almost every fabric. Steam allows textile fibers to temporarily relax, which means wrinkles are released and fabrics flattened quickly for beautiful results. Steamers also are excellent for theater curtains, banners, wall hangings, silkscreen prints on fabric, and of course clothing and costumes. The hot air freshens fabrics and may dissipate musty odors. Find the steamer that\u2019s right for your needs by perusing our picks of the best, below.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Textiles will be crisp and wrinkle-free in the twinkle of an eye with Jiffy\u2019s steamer. Its 1,300-watt solid brass heating element warms up within two minutes for fast-acting, powerful steam. You can steam wide areas with its metal head, attached with a five-foot flexible hose to a convenient rolling base, which makes it easy to move this tool around your studio. The steamer holds three-quarters of a gallon of water (\u200b\u200b2.84 liters) for 1.5 hours of steaming power per fill and features an automatic safety shut-off function. Its high-impact plastic outer casing resists breakage, and when not in use, it stores easily thanks to its slim, compact base.  Want a steamer that\u2019s ultra-compact and ultra-portable? This steamer is a top-notch choice for those looking for a handheld option. With 1,550 watts of power, it can take on wool, woven oxford, and similarly tough textiles. Plus, it\u2019s ready when you are, capable of heating up in just 45 seconds. Its tank holds 6.76 ounces of water for up to 10 minutes of continuous steam. Using it for this long is easy on the wrists, as the steamer weighs just over two pounds. It features a broad metal head\u2014which is durable and long-lasting\u2014but make sure you attach the included steam bonnet when heating up delicate fabrics like silk and rayon.  This handheld steamer is a better choice for artists shopping on a budget who still want the convenience that the Rowenta DR8080 offers. It costs about one-third the price of the Rowenta and actually operates for longer, providing 15 minutes of continuous steam with its 240-mL tank. It also weighs just 1.7 pounds, thanks to its all-plastic construction. This is a 700-watt steamer, so it gets the job done for materials like cotton and polyester. This workhorse of a steamer is perfect for classrooms, art centers, or busy theaters, quickly removing wrinkles and odors from costumes, props, backdrops, silkscreen prints, and other fiber works. The steamer\u2019s 1,500-watt central unit heats up in less than a minute and provides up to 90 minutes of high-velocity steam from its 80-ounce water reservoir. Its large steam head covers oversize objects quickly, and the heat not only smooths fabric but kills bacteria, dust mites, and bedbugs. It\u2019s ideal for light and medium-weight fabrics; heavier fabrics will need additional passes. It is compact and easy to lift at 10.4 pounds, and its telescoping pole is hidden when not in use but easily extends when needed. Though economical, note that this steamer does not have wheels. Rowenta\u2019s all-in-one, 1,500-watt steamer offers ultimate convenience in one sleek design. After heating up in just 45 seconds, it releases steam via its intelligent head, which acts as both an iron and a steamer. The head has an iron soleplate that assists with targeted, precision ironing, and if you need steam, just press a button; or, press twice for turbo bursts of steam. Mounted on two sturdy legs is what the maker calls a smart board\u2014a height-adjustable ironing board with three angled positions. Vertical, the board is great for steaming. Horizontal, it is great for ironing. At 45 degrees, it can handle both. The tank, which holds about a half-gallon of water, is easy to fill and is incorporated in the mobile base with discreet, built-in wheels.  The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\tThe ARTnews Recommends Editors\n Oh, the places you\u2019ll go, and the places you\u2019ve been. Show off your travels or plan a future excursion with a set of brand-new map pins. Not that you need to limit yourself to maps: Available in a wide range of colors, head styles, and lengths, map pins can also be used to hang pictures or secure items to bulletin boards. (Ever seen those corkboards on true crime shows? Yeah. Map pins can help with that.) The best ones should leave little trace if removed. Whether it\u2019s for studio needs, detective work, or plotting a road trip, our picks below will help you find the best map pins for your creative needs.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Have a large, complex project and need pins that really pop? For the largest selection of colors, choose this pack of 500 pins, which come in 10 contrasting hues. Packed in a clear plastic container with a compartment for each color, these durable steel needlepoint pins are 0.6 inch in length, and their rounded plastic heads come in two sizes: 1/5 inch and 1/8 inch. Pick the best size for your project and get pinnin\u2019 with these sturdy and sharp tools.  Want to label your map? This pack of 300 sturdy stainless steel pins have plastic flag-shaped ends in seven bright colors. The flag heads are small\u2014just 0.7 inches wide\u2014but there\u2019s still room on there for small notes or symbols. At 1.38 inches long, these pins are a bit longer than standard map pins. That extra length allows them to extend farther from the pinned surface or be staggered in height.  Now these are cute. This highly decorative pin\u2019s bold-red, bulb-shaped wooden head is reminiscent of the icon used by a very famous map app. The pin tip itself is short\u2014it makes up less than half the overall length\u2014and the product comes in just a 40-pack, but there\u2019s no doubt you\u2019ll put these very attractive pins to good use. They\u2019re lightweight, dimensional, and of the moment. Could this be the world\u2019s most approachable map pin? Only one way to find out.  If you hate creating holes\u2014no matter how large\u2014boy, do we have the map pin for you. Those with material to set up on a whiteboard or other magnetic surface (here\u2019s looking at you, teachers!) should claim this very paper-friendly option. These 0.4-inch-long magnetic \u201cpins\u201d come in red, blue, green, and white in a 40-count pack. Just note that in close quarters, these little magnets do what magnets are made to do: either attract or repel one another. They\u2019re best used when nicely spaced out.\u00a0  Completists, come one and all: Now you can own a set of map pins corresponding to every U.N.-recognized country in the world. The glossy plastic heads depict state flags in all their boldly colored glory, and the makers have thoughtfully included a directory sheet in case you have trouble telling Belgium from Germany. It\u2019s a gift that doubles as a time capsule, given that flags and nations will no doubt change over time. Now, for the downside: You get 194 pins, and therefore just one flag for each country. If you\u2019re seeking a handful of pins to retrace your rumspringa in Suriname, you\u2019ll need to buy multiple sets.\u00a0  The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\tAndy Battaglia\n Deputy Editor, ARTnews Moving from a string of high-profile curatorial positions in New York to a significant teaching museum down South, Daniel S. Palmer has been appointed as the next chief curator of the SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, Georgia. Most recently, Palmer was a curator at New York\u2019s Public Art Fund, which he joined in 2016. While he there, he oversaw exhibitions and major commissions for artists such as Melvin Edwards, Awol Erizku, Carmen Herrera, Harold Ancart, Tony Oursler, and Liz Glynn. He previously worked as a curator at the Jewish Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art, and has written for publications including the New York Times, Mousse, Kaleidoscope, and ARTnews. (His 2016 ARTnews essay titled \u201cGo Pro: The Hyper-Professionalization of the Emerging Artist\u201d proved prescient in ways revealing themselves still.)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Palmer\u2019s move coincides with the 10th anniversary of the museum at the Savannah College of Art and Design. In a statement, Kari Herrin, executive director of SCAD museums and exhibitions, said, \u201cDaniel Palmer is a prolific curator who brings to SCAD MOA a wealth of knowledge and experience and a dedication to representation, amplifying the voices and impact of international artists. As we usher in an exciting second decade, Daniel will be an inspiring curatorial and programming leader who will move the museum forward with vision and tenacity.\u201d Palmer, for his part, said, \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to continue this dynamic institution\u2019s mission of bringing emerging and eminent artists to inspire students and the community at a pioneering university like SCAD. I look forward to leading the museum\u2019s superb team as we encourage creativity and spark dialogue in idyllic Savannah.\u201d The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\tShanti Escalante-De Mattei\n Five painted tombs were recently unearthed in Saqqara, an ancient Egyptian necropolis just outside of Cairo, according to a report by Reuters. The The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said that a recent excavation of burial shafts resulted in the finding of the tombs, along with more than 20 sarcophagi, toys, wooden boats, masks, and more. The tombs are at least 4,000 years old, dating back to the Old Kingdom and First Intermediate period, a so called dark period in ancient Egyptian history as the regime of the Old Kingdom collapsed and political instability led to the destruction of monuments, artworks, and more. As such, not much remains from this time.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tArchaeologists Uncover Strange Jaguar Surrounded By Starfish at Aztec Site\n\n\n\n\tArchaeologists Find 40,000-Year-Old Ochre Pigment in China\n\n\n\n\n These tombs, however, are well-preserved and particularly well-decorated, with the additional inclusion of small statues and pots. Some of the paintings seem to represent food offerings. The tombs, which reside near the pyramid of King Merenre I, are believed to have belonged to senior officials and court advisors. The identity of two of those buried in the tombs has been ascertained. One was a top official named Iry, whose tomb included a limestone sarcophagus. The other was occupied by a woman named Petty, who was both a priest of Hathor and a kind of beautician for Menere I. Menere I is believed to be the father of Pepi II, the most notable pharaoh of this age whose reign is said to have lasted for more than 90 years. The Egyptian government has been actively excavating Saqqara over the past several months. In November, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced that it had found the tomb of a treasurer to the New Kingdom pharaoh Ramses II, which included several intact murals, in Saqqara. These recent discoveries come amid the government\u2019s \u201cFollow the Sun\u201d campaign that is aimed at attracting tourists to come see the archaeological wonders of ancient Egypt, both those well-known and recently discovered.

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\tTessa Solomon\n Reporter, ARTnews Two artifacts stolen nearly 30 years ago from a temple in Nepal were repatriated in a ceremony Friday at the Nepalese embassy in London. The 16th-century carved wooden Torana, a ceremonial gateway, and the 17th-century stone statue of a kneeling devotee were both taken from sacred sites near Kathmandu, said detective superintendent John Roch of the London Metropolitan police at the handover, which was attended by the Nepalese ambassador Gyan Chandra Acharya. In a statement, both parties expressed \u201ctheir willingness to work closely and promote the collaborative efforts for the preservation of cultural heritage.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The artifacts were found in the holdings of Barakat Gallery\u2019s London branch, according to The Art Newspaper. Referring to the gallery\u2019s owner, Fayez Barakat, as \u201cthe dealer\u201d, London\u2019s Metropolitan police stated that both pieces had been inherited from a deceased relative and had been in the family\u2019s possession for two decades. Barakat voluntarily relinquished the artifacts after they were determined to be the looted cultural property of Nepal. The gallery is not under suspicion of antiquities trafficking; London authorities reported that this was the first instance of a London commercial gallery willingly returning Nepalese artifacts. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLebanese Museum Returns More than 300 Allegedly Looted Artifacts to Iraq\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tDozens of Cambodian Artifacts Surrendered by Netscape Founder Amid Global Repatriation Efforts\n\n\n\n\n Prior to the artifacts\u2019 theft in the late 1980s, both pieces were photographed in situ by the art historian Ulrich von Schroeder for his publication Nepalese Stone Sculptures \u2014 Volume 2. The high-quality photographs helped prove irrefutably that they had been illegally trafficked from Nepal. The images of both were spotted in an online database by the activist group Lost Arts of Nepal, which tweeted their findings last November. In the post, the group tagged Emiline Smith, a professor of criminology at the University of Glasgow who specializes in the global illegal trade in cultural objects originating from Asia. Smith brought the post to the attention of the authorities in Nepal and Interpol, which then connected with London\u2019s police. \u201cI am deeply committed to [supporting] Nepali efforts in protecting and repatriating its rich cultural heritage, and hope we can all continue to fight to reinstate access, agency and power over their living heritage to the Nepali people,\u201d Smith wrote on Twitter on March 18.  Citizen watchdog groups have spearheaded several successful efforts to repatriate stolen sacred statuary to Nepal. Aided by the growing trend for museums to digitize their collections, activists are more easily than ever linking artifacts to the temples and stupas they once adorned. Last year, Lost Arts of Nepal, which was founded in 2015, shared on its social media channels that two carved wooden artifacts in the collection of the Rubin Museum of Art in New York were taken from the facades of Yampi Mahavihara, Lalitpur, and Itum Bahal in Kathmandu, respectively. Facing pressure from the activist group Nepal Heritage Recovery Campaign, the museum announced this January that both pieces, a 17th-century ornamental element and a carving of the female deity Gandharva from the 14th century, will be returned to Nepal. Nepal\u2019s acting consul general Bishnu Prasad Gautam received the artifacts on behalf of the Nepalese government in a ceremony organized by the museum. In a statement,\u00a0Gautam called the repatriation \u201cproactive,\u201d adding that the Rubin\u2019s cooperation has \u201cpositively contributed to Nepal\u2019s national efforts\u201d to recover its stolen cultural property from foreign collections.

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\tThe ARTnews Recommends Editors\n When it comes to charcoal paper, what you seek is a mid-weight, slightly textured paper that will not only hold up under thicker drawing pigments but also allow the material itself to truly shine. What\u2019s more, charcoal paper is often used for for other dry mediums, due to its slightly more stylized nature. We\u2019ve rounded up the best of the best charcoal paper sheets below. This clean-cut, 98-pound paper measures 19 inches by 25 inches and features a rough texture on one side and a smoother texture on the other. The tooth density is consistent, and the surfaces are durable. While designed for pastels, Canson\u2019s papers are a popular option among charcoal artists as well. Made of paper with a 55 percent cotton rag content, which helps prevent your works from deteriorating, these sheets are compatible with hard or soft charcoal as well as dry and wet processes. This set offers 10 muted colors resulting from vat-dyed fibers, which won\u2019t be influenced by any lines you apply.  This medium-tooth paper is well suited for charcoal, pastel, pencil, and even pen or ink drawings. Compared to our top option, it\u2019s more cost-effective, making it a great pick for students or pros looking to stock up on practice papers. The 60-pound weight delivers strength and can stand up to vigorous erasing. Because these sheets are made of 100 percent sulphite, they can handle both dry and wet media. The surface is extra white, providing a dramatic contrast to your dark strokes.  This paper is made of 100% cotton, making it an eco-friendly option when choosing charcoal paper. There are two deckled edges, giving it a slightly more stylized artistic finish, yet the paper itself has been machine crafted with a laid finish. It\u2019s uniquely deep black in tone, making it ideal for pastels and brighter white pigments that sit on the surface of the paper rather than seep into the fibers.   While this charcoal paper is of suitable quality for the medium, the ream of white sheets for less than $35 makes this a teacher\u2019s favorite. It features a slightly toothy surface that allows charcoals to really stick and pop but still maintains the smooth nature of a lighter-weight paper. Plus, the sheets can handle most dry and wet media, including watercolors, oil pastels, and tempera paint. Ideal for high-volume usage, this is a versatile, fun option for younger children as they learn to delve into the tricky artistic medium of charcoal and become budding artists.  This charcoal paper is quite the splurge but totally worth it for professional artists who care about the longevity of their work. Available in a pack of 10, these are perfectly textured sheets of large-scale 22-inch by 30-inch charcoal paper made by a reliable paper company in the USA. This pack of bright white paper features a two-deckled edge and is not only acid-free but also pH neutral, making it the right choice when archival quality is a necessity. It\u2019s a versatile weight that works flawlessly with everything from colored pencil to charcoal, pastels, and watercolor paints alike.  The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\tTessa Solomon\n Reporter, ARTnews An art school in Mariupol, Ukraine where hundreds of civilians were taking refuge, was bombed Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, accusing the Russian military of targeting the school. Mariupol, a coastal city home to some 400,000 people, has been subjected to a brutal bombardment since the invasion began four weeks ago, hampering efforts to rescue those trapped by the siege with little food, electricity, or water. Around 400 women, children, and elderly people, were sheltering inside Art School No. 12 in eastern Mariupol, local officials said. The constant warfare has made it difficult for aid workers to reach the rubble and assess casualties. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said in a statement that many are feared dead, but some may have fled the building ahead of the attack. \u201cWe still have to work it out,\u201d Boychenko said. \u201cThis is what we are hoping.\u201d The accusation followed reports last week that Russian shelling targeted the Mariupol Drama Theater, where approximately 800 residents were said to have been sheltering.\u00a0 Satellite imagery shared with The Washington Post showed the mangled, blackened remains of the once regal building. Half of its roof had collapsed, and parts of the interior appeared scorched. Ten days earlier, a maternity hospital was reportedly hit by an airstrike. Russia has denied involvement in that airstrike, or any others targeting known civilian refuges. Mariupol, a strategically valuable southern port, has been cut off from the outside world for more than two weeks, making it difficult to independently verify ground reports. Internet access inside the city is limited and many reporters and photographers that had been covering Mariupol have since been forced to flee. Russia\u2019s unprovoked war on Ukraine has sparked a humanitarian crisis unseen in Europe since World War II, with over 2 million refugees seeking asylum in neighboring countries. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported Sunday that 902 civilians have been killed and over 1,400 have been wounded so far in the conflict. However, the UN warned the true figure is likely \u201cconsiderably higher.\u201d Russian forces have encircled most major cities in Ukraine, and several global watchdog organizations have reported indiscriminate bombing in populated urban areas that have not spared residential buildings or cultural landmarks. In late February, the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum, located about two hours outside Kyiv, was shelled by Russian troops, resulting in the loss of roughly 25 paintings by celebrated Ukrainian folk artist Maria Primachenko. Emine Dzheppar, Ukraine\u2019s deputy minister of foreign affairs, shared footage on social media that appeared to show the museum in flames. \u201cHaving no culture of their own, they destroy all the heritage of other nations.\u201d Dzheppar wrote on Twitter, referring to the Russians who ignited the blaze. Earlier this month, a Russian missile struck near the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, a site where over 30,000 Jews were killed by the Nazis during World War II. Five people were killed during the attack and a building the center planned to use for a new museum was damaged. The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913. Subscribe today and save up to 33%!

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\tAngelica Villa\n In what may become one of the most expensive works of contemporary art ever to be sold at auction, a sixty-year-old portrait of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol will be sold at Christie\u2019s this May. Coming to a 20th-century art evening sale in New York with an estimate upon request, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) is expected to fetch a sum around $200 million. If it reaches expectations, the sale could nearly double Warhol\u2019s current record of $105.4 million, set when his 1963 canvas Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) sold at Sotheby\u2019s in 2013.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Measuring 3 feet square, the silkscreen painting depicts a press photo from Monroe\u2019s 1953 film Niagara. The image is one Warhol used repeatedly in his work until his death in 1987. It derives from his \u201cShot Marilyn\u201d portrait series, which Warhol produced after an incident at his downtown studio in 1964 when an anonymous visitor shot into and damaged a stack of canvases. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tDoris Ammann, Influential Swiss Art Dealer, Has Died\n\n\n\n\tRecords for Danh Vo, Tauba Auerbach and Rashid Johnson at $52 M. Phillips Contemporary Art Sale\n\n\n\n\n The work is being sold from the estate of Swiss art dealers Thomas and Doris Ammann, siblings who cofounded\u00a0Thomas Ammann Fine Art in 1977, a\u00a0gallery known for attracting high-profile collectors of modern and contemporary art. Doris ran the enterprise until her death at age 76 in March 2021; her brother died nearly three decades earlier, in 1993. All proceeds from the sale of the Warhol portrait will go to benefit their namesake foundation, a charitable entity established by the family\u2019s trustees to benefit causes related to health care and education for children around the world. The Foundation is set up to run for a period of only 3 to 5 years until the funds from the Warhol sale are distributed in full, a Christie\u2019s spokesperson said in a statement. The sale of the Warhol portrait marks another boost to the post-pandemic art market, as major, long-awaited consignments become available from the holdings of collectors from the Silent Generation. Before Thomas Ammann acquired the work in the 1970s, it belonged to New York publisher and storied collector S.I. Newhouse. Warhol produced only five versions of the present painting; others remain in private hands of major collectors like American investors Peter Brant and Ken Griffin. Regarding the work\u2019s importance, Alex Rotter, Christie\u2019s chairman of 20th- and 21st-century art, said in a press conference at the house\u2019s New York headquarters,\u201cthis painting was a mystery to many people in the art world. When a painting like this comes up at auction, it changes the market not only for Warhol, but it changes the market itself.\u201d  The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

        "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\tJudd Tully\n Fresh off a stellar appearance at last fall\u2019s edition of the Prospect New Orleans triennial, Willie Birch is back in New York with a retrospective at Fort Gansevoort gallery. The show, which features a rich mix of hand-crafted, mixed media figurative sculptures and works on paper in acrylic painted papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 frames, is his first in New York since 2000, when he showed at the now-shuttered Louise Ross Gallery. The artist first received praise back in 1977, as part of the Studio Museum in Harlem\u2019s famed residency program. Endorsements from artists like Romare Bearden, Norman Lewis, and Benny Andrews had landed him a spot at the vaunted museum, where he was able to hone his craft.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMyrlande Constant, Maker of Mesmerizing Voudou Flags, Has Joined Fort Gansevoort\n\n\n\n\tNick Quijano's Intimate Paintings Showcase Everyday Scenes of Puerto Rico\n\n\n\n\n Birch is best known for taking up social justice issues with a style that alludes to the works of Jacob Lawrence, Elizabeth Catlett, and Charles White while also drawing on folk art. Initially known for making use of rich colors, Birch now works predominantly in black and white, a shift that coincided with his move from New York back to his home city of New Orleans in 1994. His works earned the attention of critics early on, with the New York Times\u2019s Roberta Smith writing in 1992, on the occasion of a show at the storied Exit Art gallery, that Birch \u201ccasts an unflinching yet loving eye on black life in America.\u201d The 24-work show on view at Fort Gansevoort effectively acts as a survey of Birch\u2019s art. The pieces in it range from Boy with Kite (1987), a pencil and gouache on paper depicting a lone youngster playing against a desolate backdrop of decrepit or abandoned buildings alongside a graffiti-streaked vacant lot, to the downright chilling and ghostly Broken Dreams (Tattered White Picket Fence), 2020\u201321, which affords the viewer a sweeping view of the whitewashed fence darkly silhouetted house and thick swatches of 7th Ward foliage that Birch observed and captured on a deserted street in his neighborhood. There\u2019s also Ritual of Inevitable Violence (1989), a seemingly charming scene of five boys playing in a grass-strewn lot that takes on a sinister tone as the viewer realizes the boys are sucking on the barrels of gun-shaped candies, and Lotto Dream (1995), a sculpture depicting in part a line of people waiting to buy lotto tickets. During a recent tour of the exhibition, Birch sat down with this ARTnews to discuss the importance of New Orleans to his practice and the impact of the civil rights movement.  ARTnews: The term \u201csocial chronicler\u201d has widely been applied to you. Do you think it makes sense for your work? Willie Birch: Now, I\u2019m supposed to be a social critic\u2014the art world is fickle, and they keep coming up with new labels. One of those I always deal with is conceptualism\u2014everything is conceptual and always has been. But the point is, I\u2019ve always been trying to figure out what I want to bring to the table and how best to do that. The main thing I learned was that when you study the history of the music called jazz, it\u2019s always about content\u2014the content is what drives the ball. You have to find how to say whatever, emotionally, cognitively. You use the word \u201cconceptual,\u201d which I take to mean \u201cminimal,\u201d but your work seems to be the exact opposite . Do you view that as a contradiction? One thing I found out coming to New York was that\u2014and it didn\u2019t take me long to realize it\u2014I may have been in New York, but my head was still in New Orleans, and New Orleans is not a place that deals in Minimalism. It\u2019s excessive: the landscape is excessive. We deal with cultural manifestations like Mardi Gras. We deal with African conventions in terms of rhythm. So this idea of stripping everything down to something minimal never made sense for how I wanted to [work] because it didn\u2019t allow me enough space. The more layers you create, the more it gives a bigger opportunity for people to find what they like about a particular piece, rather than honing in on one idea. Why is New Orleans so important to you? New Orleans is the most African city in America. It\u2019s older than New York, so given its history and how it\u2019s reinvented itself, it\u2019s beyond the idea of Africa and beyond the idea of being European. It takes on its own personification. It also goes against how we think about Western art. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to work like anybody else. What impact did the civil rights movement have on your development as an artist? I was sitting in there at Woolworth\u2019s five-and-dime stores and W. T. Grant\u2019s in New Orleans when I was 18 years old and, along with civil rights crusader Oretha Castle Haley, also integrating city parks and public libraries. I had to get out of Louisiana because the segregationists were threatening my mother, but me, I won\u2019t quit. So I\u2019ve already lived through enough to ask: What does freedom mean? It\u2019s like listening to Louis Armstrong singing \u201cBlack & Blue.\u201d It sounds like an innocent song until you hear and feel the inner sufferings from the trumpet solo. What did you set out to do with this exhibition? This place is like a Nkisi [a Central African power figure or spirit from the Congo]. From top to bottom, it is magical. It takes you from 1997 to now to see this stuff and to reintroduce myself to New York and take New York on from my own turf and say, \u201cOK, you all want Willie Birch?\u201d Let\u2019s see what happens.
