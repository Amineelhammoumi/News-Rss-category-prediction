        "text": "A new Omicron subvariant of the virus that causes COVID-19, BA.2, is quickly becoming the predominant source of infections amid rising cases around the world.  Immunologists Prakash Nagarkatti and Mitzi Nagarkatti of the University of South Carolina explain what makes it different from previous variants, whether there will be another surge in the US and how best to protect yourself. BA.2 is the latest subvariant of Omicron, the dominant strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. While the origin of BA.2 is still unclear, it has quickly become the dominant strain in many countries, including India, Denmark, and South Africa. It is continuing to spread in Europe, Asia, and many parts of the world. The Omicron variant, officially known as B.1.1.529, of SARS-CoV-2 has three main subvariants in its lineage: BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. The earliest omicron subvariant to be detected, BA.1, was first reported in November 2021 in South Africa. While scientists believe that all the subvariants may have emerged around the same time, BA.1 was predominantly responsible for the winter surge of infections in the Northern Hemisphere in 2021. The first Omicron subvariant, BA.1, is unique in the number of alterations it has compared to the original version of the virus \u2013 it has over 30 mutations in the spike protein that helps it enter cells. Spike protein mutations are of high concern to scientists and public health officials because they affect how infectious a particular variant is and whether it is able to escape the protective antibodies that the body produces after vaccination or a prior COVID-19 infection. BA.2 has eight unique mutations not found in BA.1, and lacks 13 mutations that BA.1 does have. BA.2 does, however, share around 30 mutations with BA.1. Because of its relative genetic similarity, it is considered a subvariant of Omicron as opposed to a completely new variant. Some scientists have called BA.2 a \"stealth\" variant because, unlike the BA.1 variant, it lacks a particular genetic signature that distinguishes it from the Delta variant. While standard PCR tests are still able to detect the BA.2 variant, they might not be able to tell it apart from the Delta variant. BA.2 is considered to be more transmissible but not more virulent than BA.1. This means that while BA.2 can spread faster than BA.1, it might not make people sicker. It is worth noting that while BA.1 has dominated case numbers around the world, it causes less severe disease compared to the Delta variant. Recent studies from the UK\u00a0and Denmark suggest that BA.2 may pose a similar risk of hospitalization as BA.1. Yes! A recent study suggested that people previously infected with the original BA.1 subvariant have robust protection against BA.2. Because BA.1 caused widespread infections across the world, it is likely that a significant percentage of the population has protective immunity against BA.2. This is why some scientists predict that BA.2 will be less likely to cause another major wave. However, while the natural immunity gained after COVID-19 infection may provide strong protection against reinfection from earlier variants, it weakens against Omicron. A recent preliminary study that has not yet been peer-reviewed of over 1 million individuals in Qatar suggests that two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines protect against symptomatic infection from BA.1 and BA.2 for several months before waning to around 10 percent. A booster shot, however, was able to elevate protection again close to original levels. Importantly, both vaccines were 70\u00a0to 80 percent effective at preventing hospitalization or death, and this effectiveness increased to over 90 percent after a booster dose. The rise in BA.2 in certain parts of the world is most likely due to a combination of its higher transmissibility, people's waning immunity, and relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions. CDC data suggests that BA.2 cases are rising steadily, making up 23 percent of all cases in the US as of early March. Scientists are still debating whether BA.2 will cause another surge in the US. Though there may be an uptick of BA.2 infections in the coming months, protective immunity from vaccination or previous infection provides defense against severe disease. This may make it less likely that BA.2 will cause a significant increase in hospitalization and deaths. The US, however, lags behind other countries when it comes to vaccination, and falls even further behind on boosters. Whether there will be another devastating surge depends on how many people are vaccinated or have been previously infected with BA.1. It's safer to generate immunity from a vaccine, however, than from getting an infection. Getting vaccinated and boosted and taking precautions like wearing an N95 mask and social distancing are the best ways to protect yourself from BA.2 and other variants.

        "title": "Scientists Described a Dinosaur's Butthole in Exquisite Detail",
        "description": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2021-01/processed/dinobutt_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>Uncharted territory.</p>",
        "text": "When a dog-sized Psittacosaurus was living out its days on Earth, it was probably concerned with mating, eating, and not being killed by other dinosaurs. It would never even have crossed its mind that, 120 million or so years later, scientists would be peering intensely up its clacker. However, that's precisely what scientists did, publishing in 2021 an exquisitely detailed description of a non-avian dinosaur's cloaca: the catch-all hole used for peeing, pooping, mating, and laying eggs. This Swiss Army knife of buttholes is common throughout the animal kingdom today \u2013 all birds, amphibians, reptiles, and even a few mammals possess a cloaca. But we know little about the cloacae of dinosaurs, including their anatomy, what they looked like, and how the animals used them. \"I noticed the cloaca several years ago after we had reconstructed the color patterns of this dinosaur using a remarkable fossil on display at the Senckenberg Museum in Germany which clearly preserves its skin and color patterns,\" paleobiologist Jakob Vinther of the University of Bristol in the UK explained last year. \"It took a long while before we got around to finish it off because no one has ever cared about comparing the exterior of cloacal openings of living animals, so it was largely uncharted territory.\" The Psittacosaurus specimen. (Vinther et al., Current Biology, 2020) So that's what the team did, comparing the fossilized cloaca to modern cloacae. Their specimen was the only non-avian dinosaur fossil known to have a preserved cloaca, but due to the way the fossil was positioned, the internal anatomy of this opening has not been preserved; only the external vent is visible. This means there was a lot of information the researchers couldn't gauge. \"We found the vent does look different in many different groups of tetrapods, but in most cases it doesn't tell you much about an animal's sex,\" said anatomist and animal reproductive system expert Diane Kelly of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. \"Those distinguishing features are tucked inside the cloaca, and unfortunately, they're not preserved in this fossil.\" Even so, that exterior anatomy could contain some pretty interesting clues as to what some dinosaur cloacae looked like, and how they were used. Although the dinosaur's cloaca is unlike any other known modern animal, the team was able to identify several features in common with crocodilian reptiles, such as alligators and crocodiles, and birds. There was a dorsal lobe that seemed similar to the cloacal protuberance seen in birds \u2013 a rounded swelling near the cloaca during breeding season, where the male stores sperm \u2013 although, again, without the internal anatomy, it's impossible to say for sure. Secondly, the cloaca had lateral lips on either side of the opening, much like those of crocodilians. Unlike crocodilians however,\u00a0Psittacosaurus\u00a0had them arranged in a V-shape, thus the opening could have been slit-shaped; it also could have been round, like in birds. (Jakob Vinther, University of Bristol and Bob Nicholls/Paleocreations.com 2020) Above:\u00a0The cloacal vent, and how it might once have looked. Other features, however, were also similar to crocodilians. The cloacal lips were covered in small, overlapping scales and heavily pigmented with melanin. In crocodilians, these lobes function as musky scent glands that are used during social displays \u2013 a function, the researchers said, that would be supported by the heavy pigmentation. \"As a paleoartist, it has been absolutely amazing to have an opportunity to reconstruct one of the last remaining features we didn't know anything about in dinosaurs,\" said paleoartist Robert Nicholls. \"Knowing that at least some dinosaurs were signaling to each other gives paleoartists exciting freedom to speculate on a whole variety of now plausible interactions during dinosaur courtship. It is a game changer!\" Because only one fossilized cloaca has been recorded, it's impossible to tell whether the display may have been sexual, and whether the fossilized dinosaur is male or female. But the colorful lobes could hint at the shared ancestry between birds and non-avian dinosaurs, the researchers noted in their paper. Comparison of different cloacae. (Vinther et al., Current Biology, 2020) For lack of samples, this is a very understudied region of dinosaur anatomy, and only by examining a wide range of dinosaur cloacae can we learn more about how they functioned in the social and reproductive lives of these ancient animals. No doubt, other paleontologists are on the lookout for fossilized buttholes to try to fill this gap in our understanding of dinosaur life. The research was published in Current Biology.

        "description": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/ClownFishOnCoralReef_1_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>A pale new world.</p>",
        "text": "Fish communities on Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef may become less colorful as oceans warm and corals bleach, according to a new Australian study that looked at changes in reef health, coral types, and resident fish over three decades. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Future reefs may not be the colorful ecosystems we recognize today,\" write marine ecologist Chris Hemingson and his James Cook University colleagues in their paper, published in Global Change Biology. \"Our findings suggest that reefs may be at a critical transition point and might be poised to\u00a0become much less colorful in the coming years.\" The study, which comes weeks after the Great Barrier Reef was struck by another widespread bleaching event fueled by rising carbon emissions, focused on reefs surrounding Orpheus Island, which is located in the mid-section of the largest coral reef system on Earth. Previous coral bleaching events have profoundly changed the make-up of coral reefs in the area, with the loss of soft and branching corals a likely factor in the disappearance of brightly-colored fish, which are becoming increasingly rare, the study found. \u00a0 \"As these complex corals become rarer, on future reefs impacted by climate change, fish communities may become duller,\" the trio of researchers writes on their group's website. To investigate, Hemingson and colleagues looked at the diversity of colors found in communities of reef fishes and related that to the types of habitats where those fishes live. \u00a0 Whether fishes evolved bright colors to stand out and attract a mate or neutral tones to blend in and avoid predators, their coloration is naturally linked to the coral reefs they inhabit. Fish communities in healthy parts of the reef with plentiful complex corals were compared to other areas where massive, encrusted corals dominate in the wake of major disturbances, such as heatwaves and cyclones, and degraded reefs with few corals smothered in algae. \"We found that as the cover of structurally complex corals increases on a reef, so does the diversity and range of colors present on fishes living in and around them,\" says Hemingson, who focused on small fishes that rarely venture far from their home patch of reef. \"But, as the cover of turf algae and dead coral rubble increases, the diversity of colors declines to a more generalized, uniform appearance.\" (Hemingson et al.,\u00a0Global Change Biology, 2022) Above:\u00a0Fish communities in healthy (a) and damaged (b) parts of the reef. This doesn't bode well for reef fishes in warming waters, so Hemingson and colleagues looked back at data collected annually for the past 27 years on fish communities inhabiting reefs around Orpheus Island, to see whether the trends held true over time. We know from other previous studies that just 2 percent of the Great Barrier Reef remains untouched by the five mass coral bleaching events of the past 30 years \u2013 a truly horrific toll of human-caused, emissions-driven marine heatwaves. The first recorded mass bleaching event of 1998 hit the reefs around Orpheus Island especially hard, damaging complex branching corals and leading to a \"complete shift\" in fish communities, Hemingson and colleagues found. The most eye-catching yellow and green fishes, such as the lemon damselfish and green coral goby, have declined in abundance in the three decades since, by about two-thirds. \"Ongoing declines (exacerbated by further disturbance events) are likely to lead to a complete loss of these brightly colored species,\" which would effectively 'drain' the color out of fish communities, making them dull and drab, Hemingson and his coral reef compadres write. Although the massive and encrusting boulder corals that replaced soft, branching corals are more resilient to heat impacts \u2013 literally hardening the reef to future stressors \u2013 they probably provide less protection from predators for brightly-colored fishes. \"Unfortunately, this means that the corals that are most capable of surviving the immediate impacts of climate change are unlikely to maintain the diversity of colors currently supported by coral reefs,\" the researchers write. \"Fish communities on future reefs are therefore likely to be a duller version of their previous configurations, even if coral cover remains high.\" Hemingson acknowledges the grief that people may feel as fish species and corals are lost \u2013 an ecological grief that scientists studying coral reefs first-hand know all too well. But as scientists have shown with gusto, grief can be a powerful motivational force that spurs people to take action, too. \"I can either give up when I feel upset, or use those emotions to motivate me and find better solutions,\" Emma Camp, a coral biologist at the University of Technology Sydney told Nature in 2019. Fighting words for us all to live by. The study was published in Global Change Biology."

        "text": "The Juno probe has been tasked with studying a leviathan: Jupiter, the heavyweight of the Solar System, King of the Planets. But a planet the size of Jupiter, nearly 318 times the mass of Earth, isn't without its friends. The gas giant has 79 known moons (and possibly more unknown), one of them even bigger than Mercury. Juno is exploring the relationship between some of those moons and their host planet \u2013 and sometimes, seeing them show up photobombing pictures of the Big Jupe itself. The latest of these is so breathtaking, it almost looks like an artwork of science fiction. Jupiter looms large, its classic bands of roiling, swirling cloud and spot-like cyclones clearly visible on the southern hemisphere in the sunlight. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/AndreaLuck) To the right of the giant planet, two relatively small specks sail serenely against the inky darkness. These are two of Jupiter's four Galilean moons \u2013 the largest of its satellites, discovered by Galileo Galilei. The two pictured here are the smaller of the four: Io, with an equatorial diameter of 3,643.2 kilometers (2,264 miles); and Europa, with an equatorial diameter of 3,121.6 kilometers (1,940 miles). (NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/AndreaLuck) Each of these moons is a fascinating target for study in its own right. Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, speckled by over 400 active volcanoes on its surface. These are the result of internal gravitational stresses placed on the moon, not just by Jupiter, but by the three other Galilean moons This volcanic activity results in Io's atmosphere becoming rich in sulfur dioxide, spewed out by the volcanoes. That atmosphere constantly leaks, forming a plasma torus around Jupiter itself, which is channeled along magnetic fields lines to rain down onto Jupiter's poles, generating permanent aurorae. The constant spew of sulfur has also coated Io itself in various sulfur compounds, which give the moon its predominantly yellow hue. True-color image of Io. (NASA/JPL/University of Arizona) Europa, meanwhile, is the target of interest in the search for life outside Earth. Beneath its pale, icy shell lurks an interior liquid ocean. Although the moon is far from the Sun, it, too, may be internally heated by gravitational stress. If this is the case, then there may be hydrothermal vents at the floor of its global sea. Here on Earth, such vents are havens for food webs that rely not on photosynthesis, but chemosynthesis to survive: harnessing chemical reactions for food. This has led astrobiologists to believe that, of all the worlds in the Solar System, ice moons like Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus may be the most likely places to find extraterrestrial life. Juno will be making close flybys of these two very different worlds. Europa, which is also the target of a dedicated mission scheduled for a 2024 launch, will be visited by the probe in September of this year. It will be the closest any probe has been to the moon in decades. Io, meanwhile, is scheduled for flybys in late 2023 and early 2024.

        "title": "Record-Smashing Heatwaves Are Hitting Antarctica And The Arctic at The Same Time",
        "description": "<img alt=\"Sunset reflection in Antarctic Sound, Antarctica. \" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/AntarcticaSunset_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>What is going on?</p>",
        "text": "Record-breaking heatwaves hit both Antarctica and the Arctic simultaneously this week, with temperatures reaching 47\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C higher than normal. Heatwaves are bizarre at any time in Antarctica, but particularly now at the equinox as Antarctica is about to descend into winter darkness. Likewise, up north, the Arctic is just emerging from winter. Are these two heatwaves linked? We don't know yet, and it's most likely a coincidence. But we do know weather systems in Antarctica and the Arctic are connected to regions nearest to them, and these connections sometimes reach all the way to the tropics. And is climate change the cause? It might be. While it's too soon to say for sure, we do know climate change is making polar heatwaves more common and severe, and the poles are warming faster than the global average. So let's take a closer look at what's driving the extreme anomalies for each region, and the flow-on effects for polar wildlife like penguins and polar bears. Antarctica's heatwave was driven by a slow, intense high pressure system located southeast of Australia, which carried vast amounts of warm air and moisture deep into Antarctica's interior. It was coupled with a very intense low pressure system over the east Antarctic interior. To make matters worse, cloud cover over the Antarctic ice plateau trapped heat radiating from the surface. Since it's autumn in Antarctica, temperatures in the continent's interior weren't high enough to melt glaciers and the ice cap. But that's not to say large swings in temperature didn't occur. (ClimateReanalyzer.org) Above: Air temperature anomalies across Antarctica at 2 meters\u00a0above the ground for 18 March 2022. For example, Vostok in the middle of the ice plateau hit a provisional high of -17.7\u00b0C (15\u00b0C higher than previous record of -32.6\u00b0C). Concordia, the Italian-French research station also on the high plateau, experienced its highest ever temperature for any month, which was about 40\u00b0C above the March average. The story is very different on the coast as rain fell, which isn't really common for the continent. The rain was driven primarily by an atmospheric river \u2013 a narrow band of moisture collected from warm oceans. Atmospheric rivers are found on the edge of low pressure systems and can move large amounts of water across vast distances, at scales greater than continents. Despite their rarity, atmospheric rivers make an important contribution to the continent's ice sheets, as they dump relatively large amounts of snow. When surface temperatures rise above freezing, rain rather than snow falls over Antarctica. Last Monday (March 14) air temperatures at the Australian Casey Station reached a maximum of -1.9\u00b0C. Two days later, they were more like mid-summer temperatures, reaching a new March maximum of 5.6\u00b0C, which will melt ice. This is the second heatwave at Casey Station in two years. In February 2020, Casey hit 9.2\u00b0C, followed by a shocking high of 18.3\u00b0C on the Antarctic Peninsula. So what might this mean for wildlife? Ad\u00e9lie penguins, which live across the entire Antarctic coastline, have recently finished their summer breeding. But thankfully, the Ad\u00e9lie penguin chicks had already left for sea to start hunting for food on their own, so the heatwave did not impact them. The rain may have affected the local plant life, such as mosses, especially as they were in their annual phase of drying out for the winter. But we won't know if there's any damage to the plants until next summer when we can visit the moss beds again. A similar weather pattern occurred last week in the Arctic. An intense low pressure system began forming off the north-east coast of the United States. An atmospheric river formed at its junction with an adjacent high pressure system. This weather pattern funneled warm air into the Arctic circle. Svalbald, in Norway, recorded a new maximum temperature of 3.9\u00b0C. US researchers called the low pressure system a \"bomb cyclone\" because it formed so rapidly, undergoing the delightfully termed \"bombogenesis\". (ClimateReanalyzer.org) Above: Arctic air temperature anomalies at 2 meters\u00a0above the ground for 17 March 2022. Winter sea ice conditions this year were already very low, and on land there was recent record-breaking rain across Greenland. If the warm conditions cause sea ice to break up earlier than normal, it could have dire impacts for many animals. For example, sea ice is a crucial habitat for polar bears, enabling them to hunt seals and travel long distances. Many people live in the Arctic, including Arctic Indigenous people, and we know losing sea ice disrupts subsistence hunting and cultural practices. What's more, the bomb cyclone weather system brought chaotic weather to many populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere. In northern Norway, for instance, flowers have began blooming early due to three weeks of abnormally warm weather. Modelling suggests large-scale climate patterns are become more variable. This means this seemingly one-off heatwave may be a harbinger for the future under climate change. In particular, the Arctic has been warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. This is because the melting sea ice reveals more ocean beneath, and the ocean absorbs more heat as it's darker. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects Arctic sea ice to continue its current retreat, with ice-free summers possible by the 2050s. Antarctica's future looks similarly concerning. The IPCC finds global warming between 2\u00a0and 3\u00b0C this century would see the West Antarctic Ice Sheet almost completely lost. Bringing global emissions down to net zero as fast as possible will help avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

        "description": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/Volunteering_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>There's reason for hope.</p>",
        "text": "Amid the pandemic and other struggles that have affected most people on Earth in recent years, there are some bright spots of hope to be found \u2013 at least according to the new World Happiness Report 2022 just published by researchers and experts. The report is put together by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, using data from the Gallup World Poll. This year's report, the tenth anniversary of the survey, collected responses from approximately 1,000 respondents in each of the 156 countries that participate. While the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak have undoubtedly brought pain and suffering to many, there has also been an increase in support that people show for each other, and in expressions of benevolence, the study authors report. \"We found during 2021 remarkable worldwide growth in all three acts of kindness monitored in the Gallup World Poll,\" says economist John Helliwell\u00a0from the University of British Columbia in Canada. \"Helping strangers, volunteering, and donations in 2021 were strongly up in every part of the world, reaching levels almost 25 percent above their pre-pandemic prevalence.\" With disease and war continuing to impact wellbeing (the data here was collected before the conflict between Russia and Ukraine), it's a reminder that there is still hope for humanity \u2013 that in times of trial we can come together. \"This surge of benevolence, which was especially great for the helping of strangers, provides powerful evidence that people respond to help others in need, creating in the process more happiness for the beneficiaries, good examples for others to follow, and better lives for themselves,\" Helliwell says. In terms of individual countries, the people of Finland were ranked as the happiest in 2022 \u2013 the fifth year in a row the nation has held the top spot. Denmark came in second, with Iceland, Switzerland and the Netherlands rounding out the top five. The team behind the report suggests high trust, social cohesion, a good work-life balance, and free education and healthcare are the key reasons why the Scandinavian countries rank highly in the report every year. While the positioning hasn't shifted much from last year, the biggest gains in happiness were seen in Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania. The biggest drops in happiness scores were observed in Lebanon and Venezuela, and in Afghanistan, where life continues to be difficult for many since the Taliban regained control in August 2021. \"At the very bottom of the ranking we find societies that suffer from conflict and extreme poverty,\" says economist Jan-Emmanuel De Neve\u00a0from the University of Oxford in the UK. \"Notably we find that people in Afghanistan evaluate the quality of their own lives as merely 2.4 out of 10. This presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims and the fundamental importance of peace and stability for human wellbeing.\" Stress, worry, and sadness have increased overall, the researchers report, with the pandemic in particular having a \"tangible impact\" on lives and happiness. Future concerns are likely to focus around war, rises in the cost of living, and the shifts happening due to the climate crisis. Different attitudes are revealed in different age groups. Among the young, for example, life satisfaction has fallen \u2013 but it has also risen in the over-60s. However, overall there has been a slight long-term decline in the enjoyment of life in most countries. The World Happiness Report is intended to promote happiness and wellbeing as well as report on it. While researchers continue to discover new insights into what makes us happy, our happiness or lack of it still depends largely on environmental factors and what's going on around us. While conflict, disease, poverty, and inequality continue to be major problems in 2022, the researchers suggest there's plenty of potential for taking better care of ourselves, whether that's at the level of governments or individual actions. \"Acts of kindness and generosity can help us cope in difficult times by giving us a sense of purpose, something practical to focus on and showing the strength of the human spirit,\" explains Mark Williamson, CEO of the charity Action for Happiness. \"We can build good mental health by taking positive action to help others.\"\u00a0 To see the report in full, check out the World Happiness Report website."

        "description": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/CloseUpPinkTabletsWithLetterEOnThem_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>The evidence is in.</p>",
        "text": "In recent years, scientists have found that psychoactive drugs such as MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, and ketamine show promise in treating various mental health issues. Now, MDMA-assisted therapy has shown more promising results in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In findings presented at the American Chemical Society's (ACS) Spring Meeting for 2022, researchers report on follow-up results from a phase 3 clinical trial last year where MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy), coupled with therapy, was tested for the treatment of PTSD. The data indicate therapy has been effective even in hard-to-treat patients, such as those with drug or alcohol use disorders.\u00a0 \"MDMA is really interesting because it's an empathogen,\" says neuroscientist Jennifer Mitchell\u00a0from\u00a0the University of California, San Francisco.\u00a0 \"It causes the release of oxytocin in the brain, which creates feelings of trust and closeness that can really help in a therapeutic setting.\" Researchers enrolled 90 participants with severe PTSD, a condition characterized by amnesia, flashbacks, and nightmares relating to a past traumatic event, in the first phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of MDMA-assisted therapy for treatment of this disorder.\u00a0 Previous phase 2 studies determined optimal dosages of the drug, while the phase 3 trial focused on participants attending an eight-hour therapy session after receiving their dose. Participants then received two MDMA-assisted therapy sessions a month apart, in addition to weekly therapy.\u00a0 In follow-ups two months after their final MDMA-assisted therapy session, around two thirds of participants no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Conversely, only one-third of participants in the placebo plus therapy condition saw a significant reduction in their PTSD symptoms. Potential negative side effects of the drug such as nausea were minimal, and there was no evidence that participants were forming addictions to the drug.\u00a0Studies on the addictiveness of MDMA have had mixed results, so the apparent lack of addiction in the current study is a cause for optimism. The first treatment option for people with PTSD is usually selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants such as Prozac, which are usually taken on a daily basis, aren't always effective, and can come with a whole host of unpleasant side effects.\u00a0 \"The effect size for MDMA-assisted therapy is better than that for the SSRIs that have been investigated, suggesting that MDMA is a far better therapeutic for PTSD,\" Mitchell says. Researchers are currently sourcing participants for a second phase 3 trial, and if similar results are found, they believe MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD could be approved by the FDA for clinical use by 2023.\u00a0 A study was also recently completed that investigated whether MDMA-assisted therapy could be effective in groups of people who have proved resistant to traditional PTSD treatment, such as SSRIs or therapy alone.\u00a0 \"It definitely appears to be equally effective in people who are usually considered treatment resistant, so we're very excited to think that MDMA-assisted therapy is going to be an effective therapeutic in that hard-to-reach population,\" Mitchell says. While the short-term results are certainly promising, the researchers are now turning their focus to long-term data from the phase 3 trial.\u00a0 \"People in the phase 2 trial were better for years,\" Mitchell says.\u00a0\"They seemed to have a new perspective on life and engaged more. As their social skill set built up, they were happier over time.\"\u00a0 However, the long-term results from this latest phase 3 trial are less certain, since participants had more severe PTSD symptoms. Mitchell is quick to point out that people with PTSD should not try to self-medicate with MDMA. \"If MDMA is decriminalized, that doesn't mean it's safe,\" she says.\u00a0\u00a0\"It can be a very powerful tool, but it needs to have the right dose in the right context with the right support system.\" While the preliminary results are certainly encouraging, the drug itself cannot be considered a silver bullet in the treatment of PTSD and other disorders. Instead, it becomes a powerful tool for treatment once paired with therapy, as the drug elicits states of mind that make people more receptive to the benefits that therapy can offer. The results were presented at the American Chemical Society's Spring Meeting for 2022."

        "text": "Spiders rely quite significantly on touch to sense the world around them. Their bodies and legs are covered in tiny hairs and slits that can distinguish between different kinds of vibrations. Prey blundering into a web makes a very different vibrational clamor from another spider coming a-wooing, or the stirring of a breeze, for example. Each strand of a web produces a different tone. A few years ago, scientists translated the three-dimensional structure of a spider's web into music, working with artist Tom\u00e1s Saraceno to create an interactive musical instrument, titled Spider's Canvas. The team later refined and built on that previous work, adding an interactive virtual reality component to allow people to enter and interact with the web. This research, the team says, will not only help them better understand the three-dimensional architecture of a spider's web, but may even help us learn the vibrational language of spiders. \"The spider lives in an environment of vibrating strings,\"\u00a0engineer Markus Buehler of MIT explained in 2021. \"They don't see very well, so they sense their world through vibrations, which have different frequencies.\"  When you think of a spider's web, you most likely think of the web of an orb weaver: flat, round, with radial spokes around which the spider constructs a spiral net. Most spiderwebs, however, are not of this kind, but built in three dimensions, like sheet webs, tangle webs, and funnel webs, for example. To explore the structure of these kinds of webs, the team housed a tropical tent-web spider (Cyrtophora citricola) in a rectangular enclosure, and waited for it to fill the space with a three-dimensional web. Then they used a sheet laser to illuminate and create high-definition images of 2D cross-sections of the web.  A specially developed algorithm then pieced together the 3D architecture of the web from these 2D cross sections. To turn this into music, different sound frequencies were allocated to different strands. The notes thus generated were played in patterns based on the web's structure. They also scanned a web while it was being spun, translating each step of the process into music. This means that the notes change as the structure of the web changes, and the listener can hear the process of the web's construction. Having a record of the step-by-step process means we can also better understand how spiders build a 3D web without support structures \u2013 a skill that could be used for 3D printing, for example.  Spider's Canvas allowed audiences to hear the spider music, but the virtual reality, in which users can enter and play strands of the web themselves, adds a whole new layer of experience, the researchers said. \"The virtual reality environment is really intriguing because your ears are going to pick up structural features that you might see but not immediately recognize,\" Buehler explained. \"By hearing it and seeing it at the same time, you can really start to understand the environment the spider lives in.\" This VR environment, with realistic web physics, allows researchers to understand what happens when they mess with parts of the web, too. Stretch a strand, and its tone changes. Break one, and see how that affects the other strands around it. This, too, can help us understand the architecture of a spider's web, and why they are built the way they are. Perhaps most fascinatingly, the work enabled the team to develop an algorithm to identify the types of vibrations of a spider's web, translating them into \"trapped prey\", or \"web under construction\", or \"another spider has arrived with amorous intent\". This, the team said, is groundwork for the development of learning to speak spider \u2013 at least, tropical tent-web spider. \"Now we're trying to generate synthetic signals to basically speak the language of the spider,\" Buehler said. \"If we expose them to certain patterns of rhythms or vibrations, can we affect what they do, and can we begin to communicate with them? Those are really exciting ideas.\" The team's\u00a0previous research was published in 2018 in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. An earlier version of this article was published in April 2021."

        "text": "In January 1992, two cosmic objects forever changed our galaxy. For the first time, we had concrete evidence of extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, orbiting an alien star: two rocky worlds, whirling around a star 2,300 light-years away. Now, just over 30 years later, that number has exploded. This week, March 21 marked the hugely significant milestone of over 5,000 exoplanets confirmed. To be precise, 5,005 exoplanets are now documented in the NASA exoplanet archive, every one with its own unique characteristics. Each and every one of these exoplanets has appeared in peer-reviewed research, and been observed using multiple detection techniques or methods of analysis. The pickings are rich for follow-up study to learn more about these worlds with new instruments, such as the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope, and upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. \"It's not just a number,\" says astronomer Jessie Christiansen of the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech. \"Each one of them is a new world, a brand-new planet. I get excited about every one because we don't know anything about them.\"  The first two worlds ever confirmed, discovered by astronomers Alexander Wolszczan and Dale Frail, were exoplanets 4.3 and 3.9 times the mass of Earth, whirling around a dead star known as a millisecond pulsar, which sends out 'beats' or pulses of radio waves on millisecond timescales. A third exoplanet, much smaller at 0.02 times the mass of Earth, was discovered orbiting the star, since named Lich, in 1994. The exoplanets were named Poltergeist, Phobetor, and Draugr, respectively. The discovery suggested that the galaxy had to be teeming with the things. Pulsars are a type of neutron star: the dead cores of massive stars that have ejected most of their mass, then collapsed under their own gravity. Their formation process is pretty extreme, often involving colossal explosions. \"If you can find planets around a neutron star, planets have to be basically everywhere,\" Wolszczan says. \"The planet production process has to be very robust.\" But there was a catch. The technique used to identify these exoplanets was based on the very regular timing of pulses from the star, which are altered very slightly by the gravitational influence of the orbiting bodies. Alas, this technique is restricted to pulsars; it's unsuitable for main-sequence stars that don't have regular millisecond pulsations. However, when astronomer William Borucki of NASA pioneered the transit method, which observes faint, regular dips in starlight as an exoplanet passes between us and the host star, exoplanet science exploded. The Kepler Space Telescope, launched in 2009, contributed over 3,000 confirmed exoplanets to the list, with another 3,000 candidates waiting in the wings.  In addition to the transit method, astronomers can study the gravitational effect exoplanets exert on their host stars. As the objects orbit a mutual center of gravity, a star appears to 'wobble' slightly on the spot, altering the wavelengths of its light. In addition, if you know the mass of the star, you can study how much it wobbles to infer the mass of the exoplanet; and, if you know how intrinsically bright a star is, you can infer the size of the exoplanet. This is how we know that there are exoplanets out there in the Universe very, very different from those we have in our own home system. Hot Jupiters are enormous gas giants on incredibly close orbits around their stars, the proximity resulting in exoplanet temperatures that can be even hotter than some stars. Mini Neptunes inhabit the size and mass regime between Earth and Neptune, and could potentially be habitable. There are also\u00a0super Earths, which are rocky like Earth, but up to a few times the mass. Because studying exoplanets directly is very hard \u2013 they are small, very dim, very far away, and often very close to a bright star whose light drowns out anything the exoplanet might reflect \u2013 there's still a lot we don't know. There are also still a lot of worlds out there beyond our current detection thresholds. But in the years ahead, those thresholds will retreat against the advance of technology and new analysis techniques, and we may find a variety of worlds beyond our wackiest dreams. Maybe we'll even find traces of life outside the Solar System. \"I get a real feeling of satisfaction, and really of awe at what's out there,\" Borucki says. \"None of us expected this enormous variety of planetary systems and stars. It's just amazing.\""

        "text": "When the dinosaur-destroying asteroid collided with Earth 66 million years ago, massive amounts of sulfur \u2013 volumes more than were previously thought \u2013 were thrown high above land into the stratosphere, a new study finds. Once airborne, this vast cloud of sulfur-bearing gases blocked the Sun and cooled Earth for decades to centuries, then fell down as lethal acid rain on Earth, changing the chemistry of the oceans for tens of thousands of years, which is longer than previously thought, the study found. The findings show that \"we've underestimated the amount of this sulfur that this asteroid impact created,\" study co-researcher James Witts, a lecturer in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol in the UK, told Live Science. As a result, \"the climate change that was associated with it was much greater perhaps than we thought previously\". The fact that sulfur continued pouring down on Earth's surface for so long may help explain why it took so long for life, especially marine life, to recover, as some of the sulfur that fell onto the land would have then washed away into the oceans, Witts said. Related: What happened when the dinosaur-killing asteroid slammed into Earth? The researchers' finding was completely serendipitous. \"It was not something that was planned at all,\" Witts said. The team had originally planned to study the geochemistry of ancient shells near the Brazos River in Falls County, Texas \u2013 a unique place that was underwater during the end-Cretaceous extinction, when the non-avian dinosaurs died out. It's also not too far from the Chicxulub crater in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where the 6-mile-wide (10 kilometers) asteroid struck. The researchers took a few sediment samples at the site, which they hadn't planned on doing. These samples were brought to the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where study co-researcher Aubrey Zerkle, a geochemist and geobiologist, analyzed the different sulfur isotopes, or variations of sulfur that have a different number of neutrons in their nuclei. The researchers found \"a very unusual signal\" \u2013 the sulfur isotopes had unexpected tiny changes to their masses, Witts said. Such mass changes occur when sulfur enters the atmosphere and interacts with ultraviolet (UV) light. \"That can really only happen in two scenarios: either in an atmosphere that doesn't have any oxygen in it or when you have so much sulfur, it's gone really high up into an oxygenated atmosphere,\" Witts said. Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and it has been enveloped by an oxygenated atmosphere since about 2.3 billion years ago. \"We're the first people to see this sort of thing in much more recent times,\" at least in sediments that aren't on the Earth's poles, Witts said. (That's because volcanic eruptions release sulfur high into the atmosphere, which can mix with snow and end up in high concentrations in ice cores at the poles, where there is no other sulfur or sulfate to dilute the signal, Witts said.) \"You don't see [this signal] in marine rocks,\" he said. \"The sea has its own isotopic signature which totally dilutes the tiny amount of sulfur from these volcanoes.\" The fact that this signal is present in marine rock from the Cretaceous shows that, \"there must have been a heck of a lot of sulfur in the atmosphere after this impact event,\" Witts said. \"And that, of course, has a huge implication for climate change related to the impact because sulfur aerosols, we know from modern volcanic eruptions, cause cooling.\" A lot of the sulfur came from the sulfur-rich limestone at the Yucatan Peninsula. \"If the asteroid had hit somewhere else, perhaps there wouldn't have been as much sulfur released into the atmosphere and the climate change that followed might not have been as severe,\" Witts said. \"And therefore the extinction event might not have been so bad.\" Previous estimates of the sulfur aerosols entering Earth's atmosphere after the asteroid impact range from about 30 to 500 gigatons; according to climate models, this sulfur would have turned into sulfate aerosols, which would have caused 3.6 to 14.4 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 8 degrees Celsius) cooling of the Earth's surface for a few decades after the impact. But the new finding suggests that because the sulfur amount was higher, the climate change could have been even more severe. The study was published online Monday (March 21) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

        "text": "It may not feel like it, but our eyes are constantly making rapid, tiny movements called saccades, taking in new information as we focus our gaze on various things in the world. As we do so, our brains receive the input \u2013 and depending on what the object of our gaze is, it turns out the brain activity triggered can be quite unique. \"While we typically do not perceive our own eye movements, the abrupt change in visual input with each saccade has substantial consequences at the neuronal level,\" researchers explain in a new study led by first author and cognitive neuroscientist Tobias Staudigl from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany. In an experiment, Staudigl and fellow researchers worked with 13 epilepsy patients, who had electrodes implanted in their brains to monitor their condition. This kind of intervention can be helpful for brain scientists, so they often turn to such patients with electrodes already implanted, in case they'd be willing to volunteer their time. Thus, the patients consented to take part in a study in which they were instructed to freely view a range of visual stimuli displayed on a screen, including images of human faces, monkey faces, and also non-face imagery (pictures of flowers, fruit, cars, and so on). While they were doing this, a camera-based eye-tracking system monitored what objects their eyes were looking at, and the electrodes simultaneously monitored neural activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus \u2013 distinct parts of the brain that are both involved with different aspects of processing memories, amongst other functions, with the amygdala also important for regulating our emotions. (Pikovit44/Getty Images) When the participants looked at human faces, neurons fired and synchronized between the amygdala and the hippocampus in a specific pattern that was different to the results from the other stimuli \u2013 which the team interprets as evidence of how the brain handles memory encoding for important social information, distinct from other non-social objects. \"You could easily argue that faces are one of the most important objects we look at,\" says senior author of the study, Ueli Rutishauser, the director of the neuroscience research at nonprofit healthcare and research organization Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. \"We make a lot of highly significant decisions based on looking at faces, including whether we trust somebody, whether the other person is happy or angry, or whether we have seen this person before.\" The foundations for those decisions have to start somewhere, and the researchers say the process can be seen beginning in the rapid adjustments of saccadic eye movements. It's long been known that seeing faces makes neurons fire in the amygdala more so than for other forms of stimuli, although the reasons for this have remained uncertain. \"One hypothesis is that these signals are transferred from the amygdala via strong projections to the hippocampus, where they elevate and prioritize hippocampal processing of stimuli with high social and emotional significance,\" the researchers write. \"This may serve hippocampal memory encoding for salient stimuli and events.\" That could be what we're seeing here, with the researchers noting that the proportion of cells that were visually selective for human faces was substantially larger in the amygdala than in the hippocampus, suggesting that the amygdala plays a more important frontline role in identifying social stimuli in the first instance. \"We think that this is a reflection of the amygdala preparing the hippocampus to receive new socially relevant information that will be important to remember,\" Rutishauser says. Another key finding was that long-distance communication between different parts of the brain was increased when social stimuli were present. \"When a fixation on a human face followed a saccade, neural communication between the amygdala and hippocampus was enhanced,\" the researchers write. \"The same effect was not observed for saccades and fixations that landed on other stimuli.\" However, when the participants looked at human faces they had already seen earlier in the experiment, the neuron-firing pattern in the amygdala appeared more slowly \u2013 suggesting learned and familiar faces don't spark the same level of neural excitement as new social stimuli. The findings are reported in Science Advances."

        "text": "An icy barrier up to 300 stories high \u2013 taller than any building on Earth \u2013 may have prevented the first people from entering the New World over the land bridge that once connected Asia with the Americas, a new study has found. These findings suggest that the first people in the Americas instead arrived via boats along the Pacific coast, researchers said. There are two main hypotheses as to how people first migrated to North America. The older idea suggested that people made this journey when Beringia \u2013 the landmass that once connected Asia with North America, now divided by the Bering Strait \u2013 was relatively free of ice. The more recent notion suggested that travelers made their way on watercraft along the Pacific coasts of Asia, Beringia, and North America.\u00a0 A major factor influencing the way in which the first Americans arrived were giant ice sheets that once blanketed North America. Previous research suggested that an ice-free corridor between the margins of these ice sheets may have enabled travel from Beringia down to the Great Plains. Based on stone tools dating back as much as 13,400 years, archaeologists had long suggested that people from the prehistoric culture known as the Clovis were the first to migrate from Asia to the Americas. Prior work regarding the age of the ice-free corridor suggested it might have served as the migration route for Clovis people. However, scientists have recently unearthed a great deal of evidence of a pre-Clovis presence in North America. For example, in 2021, 60 ancient footprints in New Mexico suggested humans were there about 23,000 years ago, and in 2020, archaeologists discovered stone artifacts in central Mexico that were at least 26,500 years old. Related:\u00a0In photos: The Clovis culture & stone tools\u00a0 Recent estimates suggested the ice-free corridor did not open until about 14,000 to 15,000 years ago, which would mean that the earliest Americans may have relied on a coastal route instead of an overland one. Still, a great deal of uncertainty remained when it came to the age of the ice-free corridor.\u00a0 To help solve this mystery, researchers sought to pinpoint when the ice-free corridor opened. They investigated 64 geological samples taken from six locations spanning 745 miles (1,200 kilometers) along the zone where the ice-free corridor was thought to have existed. The scientists examined boulders that glaciers once carried far from their original homes, much as rivers might wash pebbles down riverbeds over time. They analyzed how long these rocks were exposed on Earth's surface \u2013 and thus how long they sat on ice-free ground \u2013 by looking at levels of radioactive elements that generated when the rocks were bombarded by high-energy rays from space. The new findings suggest that the ice-free corridor did not fully open until about 13,800 years ago, and the ice sheets \"may have been 1,500 to 3,000 feet (455 to 910 m) high in the area where they covered the ice-free corridor,\" study lead author Jorie Clark, a geologist and archaeologist at Oregon State University, told Live Science. By comparison, the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, stands about 2,722 feet (829.8 m) high. \"This is a very nicely executed study which tackles a long-standing question,\" Matthew Bennett, a researcher who studies trace fossils at Bournemouth University in England and who did not take part in this work, told Live Science. \"The results are interesting and help add to our understanding of this potential migration route. The authors are to be commended on a great bit of science.\" All in all, \"we now have robust evidence that the ice-free corridor was not open and available for the first peopling of the Americas,\" Clark said. Still, \"there is still a lot to learn about whether they actually did come down the coastal route, and if so, how did they travel. We need to find archaeological sites from the area.\" After the first wave of migration and once the ice-free corridor opened, other migration waves may have taken that more direct route, Clark noted. \"But again, we need to find archaeological sites in the ice-free corridor to evaluate when they came down.\" John Hoffecker, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who did not participate in this study, pointed out that the earliest signs of people in the Americas may reveal that humans were present there when both coastal and interior routes to North America were blocked by ice. If true, \"the simplest explanation is that they followed an interior route through the wide ice-free corridor that was present before 30,000 years ago,\" he told Live Science. The scientists detailed\u00a0their findings\u00a0online March 21 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

        "text": "In 2019, my colleagues and I discovered spooky glowing rings in the sky using CSIRO's ASKAP radio telescope in Western Australia. The rings were unlike anything seen before, and we had no idea what they were. We dubbed them odd radio circles, or ORCs. They continue to puzzle us, but new data from South Africa's MeerKAT telescope are helping us solve the mystery. We can now see each ORC is centered on a galaxy too faint to be detected earlier. The circles are most likely enormous explosions of hot gas, about a million light years across, emanating from the central galaxy. Our paper showing these results has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication by Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. We now have beautiful images of one of these rings taken with South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope, which shows the ORC in stunning detail. (Jayanne English/MeerKAT/Dark Energy Survey.) Above: MeerKAT (green/grey) image of the odd radio circle ORC1 superimposed on an optical image from the Dark Energy Survey. For example, MeerKAT sees a small blob of radio emission in the centre of the ring, which is coincident with a distant galaxy. We are now fairly certain this galaxy generated the ORC. We see these central galaxies in other ORCs too, all at vast distances from Earth. We now think that these rings surround distant galaxies about a billion light-years away, which means the rings are enormous \u2013 around a million light-years across. From modeling the faint cloudy radio emission that MeerKAT detects within the rings, it seems the rings are the edges of a spherical shell surrounding the galaxy, like a blast wave from a giant explosion in the galaxy. They look like rings instead of orbs only because the sphere appears brighter at the edges where there is more material along the line of sight, much like a soap bubble.  Above: Artist's impression of odd radio circles exploding from a central galaxy. It is thought to take the rings 1 billion years to reach the size we see them today. The rings are so big (millions of light-years across), they've expanded past other galaxies. (Sam Moorfield/CSIRO) MeerKAT has also mapped the polarization of the radio waves, which tells us about the magnetic field in the ring. Our polarization image shows a magnetic field running along the edge of the sphere. This suggests that an explosion in the central galaxy caused a hot blast to collide with the tenuous gas outside the galaxy. The resulting shock wave then energized electrons in the gas, making them spiral around the magnetic field, generating radio waves. (Larry Rudnick/MeerKAT data) ABOVE: Lines around the edge of the ORC show the direction of the magnetic field. A circular magnetic field like this indicates it has been compressed by a shock wave from the central galaxy. One big surprise from the MeerKAT result is that within the ring we see several curved filaments of radio emission. We still don't know what these are. But we do know that the sphere is so huge that it has swallowed up other galaxies as it blasted out from the central galaxy. Perhaps the filaments are trails of gas ripped off the galaxies by the passing shock wave? The big question, of course, is what caused the explosion. We are exploring two possibilities. One is that they were caused by the merging of two supermassive black holes. Such a \"merger event\" releases an enormous amount of energy, enough to generate the ORC. Another possibility is that the central galaxy went through a \"starburst\" event, in which millions of stars were suddenly born from the gas in the galaxy. Such a starburst causes hot gas to blast out from the galaxy, causing a spherical shock wave. Both black hole mergers and starburst events are rare, which accounts for why ORCs are so rare (only five have so far been reported). The puzzle of ORCs is not solved yet, and we still have much to learn about these mysterious rings in the sky. So far, we have only detected them with radio telescopes \u2013 we see nothing from the rings at optical, infrared, or X-ray wavelengths. To find out more, we need a tool even more sensitive than MeerKAT and ASKAP. Fortunately, the global astronomical community is building just such an observatory \u2013 the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), an international effort with telescopes in South Africa and Australia. ASKAP and MeerKAT were built to test the sites and technology for the SKA. Quite apart from their role as precursors for the SKA, both telescopes have been hugely successful in their own right, making major discoveries in their first years of operation. Their success in discovering and studying ORCs therefore bodes well for the SKA. The two telescopes are also beautifully complementary \u2013 ASKAP is superb at surveying large areas of sky and finding new objects, while MeerKAT is unrivaled for zooming in on those objects and studying them with higher sensitivity and resolution. The SKA promises to surpass both. No doubt the SKA will find many more ORCs, and will also be able to probe them to find out what they are telling us about the life cycle of galaxies.

        "text": "If you have an overreaction to 'triggering' sounds such as other people chewing or drumming their fingers, you probably have misophonia.\u00a0Last year, scientists finally discovered a key brain connection responsible for setting it off. The connection runs from the auditory cortex (the brain's hearing center) to the orofacial motor cortex (controlling movement of the face, mouth and throat). This makes sense, as most misophonia-triggering sounds are caused by actions involving the human face \u2013 such as chewing or breathing. As a result of the findings, the researchers have a suggestion: People with misophonia are actually experiencing a stimulation of the same part of the motor cortex that is causing the triggering sound from someone else. \"Our findings indicate that for people with misophonia there is abnormal communication between the auditory and motor brain regions,\" said neuroscientist Sukhbinder Kumar, from Newcastle University in the UK. \"You could describe it as a 'super-sensitized connection'. This is the first time such a connection in the brain has been identified for the condition.\" The team analyzed fMRI brain scans from a total of 75 people with and without misophonia to discover this super-sensitized connection. Data was collected with no noise, with misophonia trigger sounds (like chewing), with sounds designed to be unpleasant to everyone (like screaming), and with neutral sounds (like rainfall). The researchers made an additional discovery too: a stronger connection between the motor cortex and the visual cortex. This gives us more clues about what might be setting off misophonia in the brain. \"What surprised us was that we also found a similar pattern of communication between the visual and motor regions, which reflects that misophonia can also occur when triggered by something visual,\" said Kumar. \"This leads us to believe that this communication activates something called the 'mirror system', which helps us process movements made by other individuals by activating our own brain in a similar way \u2013 as if we were making that movement ourselves.\" This mirror neuron system, which has been previously studied, is thought to work in the same way inside the brain whether we're actually doing something or watching someone else do it. The researchers suggested that misophonia is so uncomfortable because it feels like an intrusion into the brain when this mirroring happens. That idea is backed up by one of the ways misophonia can be managed in some people: by mimicking the action creating the trigger sound and thus taking back control. If we can better understand how that works, we could improve our approaches to managing misophonia, which can have a seriously negative impact on people's day-to-day lives. Between 6 to 20 percent of the population are thought to be living with some form of misophonia, but there's still plenty about it that we don't understand. In its most severe form, it can make some work, family and social situations almost intolerable. \"The study provides new ways to think about the treatment options for misophonia,\" neurologist Tim Griffiths, from Newcastle University, said last year. \"Instead of focussing on sound centers in the brain, which many existing therapies do, effective therapies should consider motor areas of the brain as well.\" The research was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

        "description": "<img alt=\"The diamond anvil used to squash the sample. \" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/diamond-anvil-for-pressurising-water-ice_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>Literally cool!</p>",
        "text": "A new crystalline form of water ice has been discovered in fleeting transitions between phases at high pressures. It's called Ice-VIIt, and it takes place as the substance slides between two already known, cubic arrangements of molecules.\u00a0Although it's unlikely Ice-VIIt would naturally appear on Earth's surface, it could reveal more about how water behaves on massive alien worlds. We might think it commonplace, but water is actually pretty weird\u00a0compared to other liquids we know. The arrangement of molecules within water's frozen form \u2013 ice \u2013 can vary significantly, depending on the conditions around it. We know of at least 19 of these solid phases of ice, some of which occur naturally, some of which have only been seen in laboratory conditions. The ice you see in the freezer, or falling from the sky as snowflakes or hailstones, is the most common natural ice on Earth. It is called Ice-I, with oxygen atoms arranged in a hexagonal grid. The structure is, however, geometrically frustrated, with the hydrogen atoms hanging about in a disorderly fashion. When physicists cool Ice-I at various temperatures and apply different pressures to it, the hydrogen and oxygen atoms within can periodically reach different arrangements, sometimes even ordering themselves more neatly. These various forms of water ice are not always stable, but we can explore these in the lab to reveal their curious molecular structures. Two of these phases that have cubic structures are Ice-VII, which has disordered hydrogen, and Ice-X, which is symmetric. These can be reached by subjecting ice to high pressures tens to hundreds of thousands greater than Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level, Ice-VII at even lower pressures than Ice-X. To study the transitions between ice phases, a team of physicists led by Zach Grande of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas performed experiments on high pressure ice using a new technique to measure the properties of the ice as pressure was applied.\u00a0 The researchers squeezed a sample of water in a diamond anvil, forcing it to freeze in a jumble of crystals. Lasers were used to then heat the sample, causing it to melt before re-freezing into what the researchers described as a powder-like collection of crystals. By incrementally raising the pressure in the anvil, with periodic blasts from the laser, the researchers created Ice-VII, and observed the transition to Ice-X. In between, thanks to their new measurement technique, they also observed the new intermediate phase, Ice-VIIt. In this phase, the cubic lattice of Ice-VII is stretched along one of its vectors so that the structure extends into a rectangular arrangement, with a cubic footprint, before settling into the symmetric, fully ordered cubic arrangement of Ice-X. This arrangement is known as tetragonal. The team also showed that Ice-X can form at much lower pressures than previously thought. Ice-VII forms from approximately 3 gigapascals; that is, 30,000 atmospheric pressures. According to the team's observations, the transition to Ice-VIIt occurs at around 5.1 gigapascals. Previous reports have put the transition pressure for Ice-X between 40 and 120 gigapascals. However, Grande and his team observed the transition between Ice-VIIt and Ice-X occurring at around 30.9 gigapascals. This, the team said, should help resolve the debate about the Ice-X transition pressure. \"Zach's work has demonstrated that this transformation to an ionic state occurs at much, much lower pressures than ever thought before,\" said physicist Ashkan Salamat of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"It's the missing piece, and the most precise measurements ever on water at these conditions.\" This, the team said, could have important implications for studying the interior conditions of other worlds. Water-rich planets outside the Solar System could, they said, have Ice-VIIt in abundance, even increasing the chance of conditions suitable for the emergence of life. The team's research has been published in Physical Review B."

        "text": "On Sept. 1 and 2, 1859, telegraph systems around the world failed catastrophically. The operators of the telegraphs reported receiving electrical shocks, telegraph paper catching fire, and being able to operate equipment with batteries disconnected. During the evenings, the aurora borealis, more commonly known as the northern lights, could be seen as far south as Colombia. Typically, these lights are only visible at higher latitudes, in northern Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia. What the world experienced that day, now known as the Carrington Event, was a massive geomagnetic storm. These storms occur when a large bubble of superheated gas called plasma is ejected from the surface of the sun and hits the Earth. This bubble is known as a coronal mass ejection. The plasma of a coronal mass ejection consists of a cloud of protons and electrons, which are electrically charged particles. When these particles reach the Earth, they interact with the magnetic field that surrounds the planet. This interaction causes the magnetic field to distort and weaken, which in turn leads to the strange behavior of the aurora borealis and other natural phenomena. As an electrical engineer who specializes in the power grid, I study how geomagnetic storms also threaten to cause power and internet outages and how to protect against that. The Carrington Event of 1859 is the largest recorded account of a geomagnetic storm, but it is not an isolated event. Geomagnetic storms have been recorded since the early 19th century, and scientific data from Antarctic ice core samples has shown evidence of an even more massive geomagnetic storm that occurred around 774\u00a0CE, now known as the Miyake Event. That solar flare produced the largest and fastest rise in carbon-14 ever recorded. Geomagnetic storms trigger high amounts of cosmic rays in Earth's upper atmosphere, which in turn produce carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon. A geomagnetic storm 60 percent smaller than the Miyake Event occurred around 993 CE. Ice core samples have shown evidence that large-scale geomagnetic storms with similar intensities as the Miyake and Carrington events occur at an average rate of once every 500 years. Nowadays the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration uses the Geomagnetic Storms scale to measure the strength of these solar eruptions. The \"G scale\" has a rating from 1 to 5 with G1 being minor and G5 being extreme. The Carrington Event would have been rated G5. It gets even scarier when you compare the Carrington Event with the Miyake Event. Scientist were able to estimate the strength of the Carrington Event based on the fluctuations of Earth's magnetic field as recorded by observatories at the time. There was no way to measure the magnetic fluctuation of the Miyake event. Instead, scientists measured the increase in carbon-14 in tree rings from that time period. The Miyake Event produced a 12 percent increase in carbon-14. By comparison, the Carrington Event produced less than 1 percent increase in Carbon-14, so the Miyake Event likely dwarfed the G5 Carrington Event. Today, a geomagnetic storm of the same intensity as the Carrington Event would affect far more than telegraph wires and could be catastrophic. With the ever-growing dependency on electricity and emerging technology, any disruption could lead to trillions of dollars of monetary loss and risk to life dependent on the systems. The storm would affect a majority of the electrical systems that people use every day.  Geomagnetic storms generate induced currents, which flow through the electrical grid. The geomagnetically induced currents, which can be in excess of 100 amperes, flow into the electrical components connected to the grid, such as transformers, relays and sensors. One hundred amperes is equivalent to the electrical service provided to many households. Currents this size can cause internal damage in the components, leading to large scale power outages. A geomagnetic storm three times smaller than the Carrington Event occurred in Quebec, Canada, in March 1989. The storm caused the Hydro-Quebec electrical grid to collapse. During the storm, the high magnetically induced currents damaged a transformer in New Jersey and tripped the grid's circuit breakers. In this case, the outage led to five million people being without power for nine hours. In addition to electrical failures, communications would be disrupted on a worldwide scale. Internet service providers could go down, which in turn would take out the ability of different systems to communicate with each other. High-frequency communication systems such as ground-to-air, shortwave and ship-to-shore radio would be disrupted. Satellites in orbit around the Earth could be damaged by induced currents from the geomagnetic storm burning out their circuit boards. This would lead to disruptions in satellite-based telephone, internet, radio and television. Also, as geomagnetic storms hit the Earth, the increase in solar activity causes the atmosphere to expand outward. This expansion changes the density of the atmosphere where satellites are orbiting. Higher density atmosphere creates drag on a satellite, which slows it down. And if it isn't maneuvered to a higher orbit, it can fall back to Earth. One other area of disruption that would potentially affect everyday life is navigation systems. Virtually every mode of transportation, from cars to airplanes, use GPS for navigation and tracking. Even handheld devices such as cell phones, smart watches and tracking tags rely on GPS signals sent from satellites. Military systems are heavily dependent on GPS for coordination. Other military detection systems such as over-the-horizon radar and submarine detection systems could be disrupted, which would hamper national defense. In terms of the internet, a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the Carrington Event could produce geomagnetically induced currents in the submarine and terrestrial cables that form the backbone of the internet as well as the data centers that store and process everything from email and text messages to scientific data sets and artificial intelligence tools. This would potentially disrupt the entire network and prevent the servers from connecting to each other. It is only a matter of time before the Earth is hit by another geomagnetic storm. A Carrington Event-size storm would be extremely damaging to the electrical and communication systems worldwide with outages lasting into the weeks. If the storm is the size of the Miyake Event, the results would be catastrophic for the world with potential outages lasting months if not longer. Even with space weather warnings from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the world would have only a few minutes to a few hours notice. I believe it is critical to continue researching ways to protect electrical systems against the effects of geomagnetic storms, for example by installing devices that can shield vulnerable equipment like transformers and by developing strategies for adjusting grid loads when solar storms are about to hit. In short, it's important to work now to minimize the disruptions from the next Carrington Event.   David Wallace, Assistant Clinical Professor of Electrical Engineering, Mississippi State University.

        "text": "Although many of us are likely trying our best to be interesting, boring people are seemingly everywhere.\u00a0Maybe it's the person who never finishes a story properly, or someone who just can't stop filling you in on\u00a0their bird-watching 'adventures'. A new paper has investigated what makes people appear boring, and how this impacts our perceptions in relation to boring people. To do this, researchers asked over 500 people in five different studies to rank the most stereotypically boring characteristics, hobbies, and jobs.\u00a0 \"Unfortunately, some people are perceived as boring,\" the team, led by University of Essex psychology researcher Wijnand Van Tilburg, writes in their paper. \"We examined the stereotypical features of boring others by having people generate and then rate these [..] These results suggest that being stereotyped as a bore may come with substantially negative interpersonal consequences.\" In the first two studies, which included a total of 463 people recruited via MTurk, the team asked participants to write down a list of boring features, and then rank them. The volunteers classified data analysis, accounting, tax/insurance, cleaning, and banking as the five most boring jobs, while the most boring hobbies were sleeping (huh?), religion, watching TV, observing animals, and doing math (poor mathematicians!). When asked about the characteristics of stereotypical bores, people nominated attributes like having no interests, no sense of humor, being unopinionated, or a bit of a complainer. \"The more typical the features of stereotypical boringness described a person, the more the person was perceived as boring,\" the team writes. \"Furthermore, and important for the social consequences of such perception, stereotypical boringness affected perceptions of interpersonal warmth and competence.\" While it's all a bit fun to think up the most boring people imaginable, those that see themselves in the above traits might actually be getting the rough end of the stick in social situations. In the next two studies the team undertook, when people were presented with descriptions of imaginary people according to the 'boring characteristics' found in the first study (including adjectives such as \"uneducated\" or \"has a monotonous voice\"), the bores were seen as lacking warmth and competence, and were socially avoided. Even worse, in the last study, when asked how much they'd need to be financially compensated for spending time with a 'stereotypical bore' described in a vignette, participants nominated significant sums of money compared to vignettes of less boring people. \"Perceptions can change, but people may not take time to speak to those with 'boring' jobs and hobbies, instead choosing to avoid them,\" said Van Tilburg. \"They don't get a chance to prove people wrong and break these negative stereotypes.\" This is a relatively small study, and the majority of participants lived in the United States, so it's likely that around the world different jobs, hobbies, and characteristics might be classed as boring. But this study is one of the first to investigate the 'boring people' stereotype across multiple domains, and having this information is important to try and break those stereotypes down. For example, the team questions why boring people were also seen as incompetent by the study participants, despite these attributes being unrelated.\u00a0 \"I would have thought that accountants would be seen as boring, but effective and the perfect person to do a good job on your tax return,\" said Van Tilburg. \"The truth of the matter is people like bankers and accountants are highly capable and have power in society \u2013 perhaps we should try not to upset them and stereotype them as boring!\" The research has been published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.

        "text": "The sprawling ruins of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck \u2013 a vast, ancient human settlement in what we now know as Turkey \u2013 are much like a precursor to the modern metropolis of today. Yet, over the course of 9,000 years, times have certainly changed. \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, often described as one of the world's oldest cities, was one of the largest Neolithic settlements in Anatolia, providing a home for up to 8,000 people at its peak, after its founding in approximately 7100 BCE. But while this sprawling city of the past shares many similarities with modern urban centers, striking contrasts are also apparent. Hand print on wall. (Jason Quinlan/\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck Research Project) One of the most obvious: \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck had no streets. Dwellings were constructed directly alongside each other, so that the only way to enter buildings was to climb down into them from the rooftop. Once inside, even if nobody was around, you were not alone. The people of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck buried their dead inside their homes, underneath the floor. \"Adults were most often placed in a flexed position, located beneath the northern and eastern platforms of the central room,\" a team of researchers, led by first author and archaeo-anthropologist Eline Schotsmans from the Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux in France, explains in a new study analyzing the funerary practices of ancient \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck. \"Perinate, neonate, and infants were buried in more variable locations within the house.\" Burial placement wasn't the only custom unusual by our modern Western standards. \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck's skeletons were sometimes ritualistically painted before burial, although much has remained unknown about the specifics of the pigments used \u2013 and the symbolism of their colorings. In the new study, Schotsmans and fellow researchers examined the skeletal remains of former \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck individuals, over 800 of whom have been excavated since the early 1990s; the team also analyzed the pigments used on them (or on associated burial items) with an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Detail of cinnabar stripe on cranium of male individual. (Marco Milella) Ultimately, only a small minority of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck's dead (about 6 percent of the individuals studied here) were directly treated with pigments, while 11 percent featured pigment on grave items buried with the deceased, such as stained shells, bowls, baskets, and bone objects. Pigments applied to skeletal remains were always red in color (usually on the cranium), with red ochre being the most commonly used pigment. More males than females received direct treatment with pigment, and adults were also slightly more likely than children to be painted. Less common pigments seem to have reflected the social identity of the deceased, the researchers observe, with cinnabar (a red form of mercury sulfide) reserved largely for males, and either directly painted onto bone, or absorbed from red headbands the men wore while alive or when buried after death. Meanwhile, blue and green pigments on burial items were solely limited to females and children. \"These colors have sometimes been associated with concepts of growth, fertility, and ripeness, which are abstractions that could be related to the transition to agriculture,\" the researchers write, although they note that the limited sample size of the colorants found so far limits our ability to interpret the discoveries. What is clear, however, is that there's some kind of link between the numbers of burials within a dwelling and layers of painting found on the walls above the grave. \"This means: when they buried someone, they also painted on the walls of the house\",\u00a0says\u00a0senior researcher and anthropologist Marco Milella from the University of Bern in Switzerland. Geometric wall painting inside building. (Jason Quinlan/\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck Research Project) Aside from the issue of pigment, not everybody in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was buried in the same way, or perhaps buried at all. Among the human remains found in the ancient city, some have never been disturbed since Neolithic times, while others were interfered with by subsequent Neolithic activity, with evidence of disarticulated skeletons or isolated bones. This could potentially mean that skeletal elements were sometimes dug up in ancient \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, with the bones of deceased individuals serving some form of symbolic role in the community, before later being buried again. \"Other individuals, either as complete bodies or loose skeletal elements, remained in the community,\" the researchers write. \"These circulating skeletal elements were eventually deposited in secondary or tertiary deposition contexts, which may also have been linked to the creation of architectural paintings in an indirect way.\" As for what purpose this served, it's impossible to know for sure, but the researchers say the continued use of excavated human remains within the community could have been a way of keeping the memory of those people alive, in a manner of speaking. \"According to socio-cultural anthropologists, collective memory is handed down from generation to generation through repetition of past actions and by direct object-to-memory association,\" the researchers explain. \"Intramural burials may have been a part of processes of memory retention with each interment contributing to communal memory by keeping the deceased close to the daily rhythm of repeated household activities.\" The findings are published in Scientific Reports."

Although the galaxy isn't birthing stars at a rate high enough to categorize it as a starburst galaxy, its activity is three times higher than the average for galaxies of its type. Astronomers think this could be because of an interaction with another galaxy, millions of years ago. The clue to support this lies with one of NGC 4254's spiral arms, which seems looser and more extended than the other. This ancient interaction would have perturbed NGC 4254, causing enough compression in its molecular gas to trigger heightened star formation activity. The new MUSE image of NGC 4354.

        "description": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/WomanHoldingRedSupplementGummiesInHand_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>It's not 'just' a supplement.</p>",
        "text": "I have been a doctor for over 20 years, 12 of which were dedicated exclusively to the practice of sleep medicine. Over the years, I have seen an enormous increase in the use of melatonin by my patients and their families. Although melatonin has helped many of my patients, there are some concerns that I have that are worth sharing. First, I am not sure most of my patients that took melatonin before my clinical evaluation knew exactly what melatonin was. Melatonin is a hormone produced by a gland in the brain called the pineal gland. The main function of melatonin is sleep regulation. Melatonin levels increase in response to darkness, telling the brain that night has arrived and it is time to sleep. When there is bright light, as in the morning, melatonin production shuts down and the brain knows that it is daytime. The day-night regulation properties of melatonin and light make them the two key factors in the establishment of the internal sleep-wake clock, or what is called the \"circadian cycle\". A circadian disorder occurs when there is a mismatch between the internal clock and the socially accepted time to go to sleep or to wake up, as is seen when someone travels across time zones and has jet lag. But jet lag sometimes can occur in the absence of travel. For example, when you remain in an environment of bright lights until late hours of the night, you fool your brain into thinking that it is still daytime. In this case, melatonin production does not occur and you don't feel sleepy until the late hours of the night, or sometimes early hours in the morning. I have seen many teenagers come to my clinic because they can't sleep until 2 am or 3 am, but they're up watching videos on their electronic devices until late at night. I usually recommend my patients turn the lights off at a reasonable time and expect sleepiness to start occurring within one hour. But it takes time for the natural clock to adjust to a new schedule, and often my patients prefer to use a melatonin supplement to quicken the circadian time adjustment. With the increase in use of electronic devices, sleep disorders have become quite common and melatonin use has increased. Because of its sleep-promoting properties, melatonin is also an incredibly attractive option for people who suffer from insomnia or sleep disruption. In some countries, such as the US, melatonin can be bought without a prescription. This situation concerns me because a lack of regulation can mean an increased risk of taking a different dose or ingredients than those reported. In fact, a study of melatonin supplements found that the content of the hormone ranged from -83 percent to +478 percent of the labelled content. The researchers also found other substances that were not reported to be in the preparation, including serotonin and valerian. In the EU, the UK, Canada and Australia, melatonin is obtained only by prescription for the short-term treatment of insomnia. This approach allows for better regulation, understanding and explanation of risks, benefits and alternatives to the use of melatonin. Even though melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone, it does not come without side-effects, the most common being headaches and dizziness. It can also interact with other medicines, such as anticoagulants (drugs that help prevent blood clots). The best evidence of safety for the use of melatonin is for short-term use only (one to three months) and in low doses (0.5-1mg). The long-term effects of melatonin remain unknown. Have I used melatonin or recommended it to my patients? Absolutely. But only when I know exactly what I am recommending it for. Insomnia can be a symptom of a sleep disorder like restless legs syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea, or it can be a symptom of another condition, such as depression, asthma or pain. When a sleep specialist identifies the correct diagnosis, then the treatment options can be explored. When I need to prescribe melatonin, I usually recommend starting with the lowest dose possible (0.5 mg) one to two hours before their current bedtime, and I recommend that the patient turns their lights off, or dims them, before taking melatonin. I also recommend avoiding other contributors to poor sleep, such as caffeinated products after 3 pm, heavy exercise in the evening, or the use of electronic devices before bedtime.   Lourdes M.

May the SEC regulate only on financial issues, i.e. \"materiality,\" or may it regulate with larger social, economic, or political objectives in mind?\u00a0 The big squeeze now is to squeeze the latter in to the former. Disclose that the company doing something unpopular, even if it may have no financial effect, because someone might decide they don't like it -- either the twitter mob or future regulators -- and cause you trouble. (I am deliberately not using legalize here.) The carbon rules are not entirely new ground here, but so deep into that territory that the question is now loud and clear.\u00a0 2) \"Disclosure\" usually means revealing something you know. A perfectly honest answer to \"disclose what you know about your carbon emissions\" is, \"we have no idea what our carbon emissions are.\" Back that up with every document the company has ever produced, and you have perfectly \"disclosed.\" There is no asymmetric information, fraud, etc.\u00a0 The SEC has already required the production of new information, and as Hester Peirce\u00a0makes perfectly clear, the climate rules again make a huge dinner out of that appetizer: essentially telling companies to hire a huge number of climate consultants to generate new information, and also how to run businesses. \u00a0 The fixed costs alone are huge. The trend to going private and abandoning public markets, at least in the U.S. will continue. The trend to large oligopolized politically compliant static businesses in the U.S. will continue.\u00a0 I would bet these rules wind up in court, and that these are important issues. They should be.\u00a0 3) \u00a0The SEC's timing relative to Russian sanctions makes an interesting one-two punch, as Walter Russell Mead points out. Suppose you're Brazil. Hmm. When will the U.S. decide to impose financial sanctions on Brazil for not following our ideas of climate policy, or the SG (social, governance) part of ESG? Maybe we should find alternative financial channels, pronto. \u00a0  I'm yet to read the 500 page PDF, but am curious, do Scope 3 disclosures include the greenhouse gas emissions from employees? Like, hiring someone with a longer commute may result in higher emissions reported, underuse of work from home policies, or even use of labor in high emissions markets (USA) vs low emissions (take your pick of developing countries).If not, it creates a disadvantage from employing Capital vs Labor - if energy use on servers/forklifts/conveyor belts must be captured, this then creates a disincentive to employing such labor saving technologies if you're not capturing the carbon \"savings\" from not needing people to perform the procedures anymore. Another nudge against productivity growth. \"The SEC has already required the production of new information, and as Hester Price [*] makes perfectly clear, the climate rules again make a huge dinner out of that appetizer... .\"[*]  Commissioner Hester M. Peirce.Typo at [*]. OT, but maybe worth pondering as a similar type of over-reach. \"ARLINGTON, Va. -- The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday approved Nasdaq's groundbreaking proposal to boost the number of women, racial minorities and LGBTQ people on U.S. corporate boards.The new policy \u2014 the first of its kind for a U.S. securities exchange \u2014 requires most of the nearly 3,000 companies listed on Nasdaq to have at least one woman on their board of directors, along with one person from a racial minority or who identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer. It also requires companies to publicly disclose statistics on the demographic composition of their boards.\"---30---There are lot of reasons to feel uncertain about this Nasdaq rule. Including...do we want to get into people's private sex lives?  \n\n\nComments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments. I welcome thoughtful disagreement. I will block comments with insulting or abusive language. I'm also blocking totally inane comments. Try to make some sense.  I am much more likely to allow critical comments if you have  the honesty and courage to use your real name.\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

Pierce: Required disclosures of so-called transition risks also present these challenges. \u00a0The proposal defines \u201ctransition risks\u201d broadly as: the actual or potential negative impacts on a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains attributable to regulatory, technological, and market changes to address the mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate-related risks, such as increased costs attributable to changes in law or policy, reduced market demand for carbon-intensive products leading to decreased prices or profits for such products, [JC: how about skyrocketing prices of carbon-intensive products due to regulatory strangulation of supply, like look out the window?] the devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and litigation defense costs, competitive pressures associated with the adoption of new technologies, reputational impacts (including those stemming from a registrant\u2019s customers or business counterparties) [JC: disclose that the twitter mob might be after you] that might trigger changes to market behavior, consumer preferences or behavior, and registrant behavior.[35] Transition risk can derive from potential changes in markets, technology, law, or the more nebulous \u201cpolicy,\u201d which companies will have to analyze across multiple jurisdictions and all across their \u201cvalue chains.\u201d \u00a0These transition assessments are rooted in prophecies of coming governmental and market action, but experience teaches us that such prophecies often do not come to fruition. \u00a0Markets and technology are inherently unpredictable. \u00a0Domestic legislative efforts in this context have failed for decades,[36] and international agreements, like the Paris Accords, have seen the United States in and out and back in again.[37] \u00a0 I.e. make up what the regulators want to hear.\u00a0 VI.

That's the only reason to build them. They don't make sense without the tax credit.\" It reminds me of WEllington who was opposed to trains because it  let \"ordinary people get  around  unnecessarily\" I live near NYC...I have not attended a party in 5 years without some ex-banker telling me how he is MAKING a killing on renewable deals!If you wanted to lower CO2...bang for buck is first reduce usage, 2nd Nuclear power, solar and wind operate around 40% of the time...and our terrible solutions! --Judenstern! In more local practice, a method of recreating the Salem witchcraft trials.--The federal government is pursuing contradictory policies, or wishes or rhetoric, on energy prices and the environment. That needn't bother politicians who appeal to one or the other or both interest groups. And it doesn't. The [political] chickens will surely come home to roost, but not just yet. The following thoughts were provoked by an abridged review of the 510-page S.E.C. document: \"The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors\", [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33-11042.pdf].The proposed rules will have an effect similar to the effect that \"Sarbanes-Oxley\" had on registration and new public listings, i.e., negative.Apart from the obvious creation of demand for more accountants and corporate lawyers, the proposed rules will increase the potential liability of corporate boards of directors and executives and officers of registrants.The level of detail stipulated in the proposed rules will give rise to costs that will likely outweigh the possible benefit that the rules are intended to achieve.The time horizons for the projected \"likely material effects\" are not specified, but comments are invited on whether the proposed rules should specify ranges (in years) for \"short-\", \"medium-\", and \"long-term\" horizons.  The rule notification suggests 1-3 years or 1-5 years for short-term material effects, etc., up to and including 40 to 50 years for long-term material effects.  This begs the question of the reliability of forecasts out to those horizons and the difficulty of determining the probability of events that would give rise to future \"likely material effects\" that would require disclosure under the proposed rules.  A new caste of \"fortune tellers\" will be needed to foretell those events and the probability of occurrence.It is easy to imagine that firms adversely affected by the proposed rules will soon be considering de-registration.  The proposed rules cover foreign corporations registered with the S.E.C.  Those foreign corporations may soon be considering de-registration.  Private corporations that may have been considering going public in the U.S. will now have to re-consider those plans if the proposed rules impose onerous filing requirements (cf. \"Sarbanes-Oxley\").The evident absence of balance between the cost of preparing the disclosures required under the proposed rules, and the alleged benefits accruing to shareholders from those required disclosures will need to be addressed by the Commission if it is to meet its legislative mandate.Administrative law in the U.S. is increasingly burdensome.  At some point, the attractiveness of U.S. markets to corporations seeking raise risk capital will decline.  We may be witnesses to that decline in the coming years.The trend towards \"going private\", exemplified by Dell Computer, may be given a boost by the proposed rules.  At a minimum, as noted earlier, corporations will find it increasingly difficult to recruit qualified candidates for membership on corporate boards of directors, officers and executives.What will the industrial basis of the United States look like in ten, twenty, or fifty years from now?  Will manufacturing be outsourced to Asia to the extent that no sizeable manufacturing base is present in the U.S.?  To avoid having to report Scope 3 emissions (upstream suppliers' and downstream distribution chains' and customers' emissions), corporations will refrain from making commitments to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.  Is this a desireable outcome for these proposed rules? This doesn't even address the best/worst part.  Since almost anything now can be deemed to be securities fraud, crafty lawyers for climate activists will take advantage of the necessarily sweeping but nebulous disclosure calculations to assert fraud claims against disfavored companies and industries.  The nuisance will cost defendants millions to defend.  Same as it ever was. In my nearly 40 years of reading SEC disclosures, the only purpose for imposing such nebulous disclosures is to feed the plaintiff's bar--another area for plaintiff lawyers to go after companies with so-called strike suits. Shameful as it is obvious. There will never be sufficient disclosures to satisfy the plaintiff bar because stuff happens, the future is not known and cannot be known. Looking backwards, as these lawsuit do, is a con. This looks like a data grab - not entirely bad if we want evidence based policies. But I figure it'll just be another form of accounting where 2 + 2 = fish. I don't think it'll be good data.  Curious. After Raskin withdrew as Biden's Fed nominee over a clash about her  climate views. Hayek put it best. \"Pretense of knowledge.\" SEC regulators can't have all the information necessary to implement this nonsense. Thinking on the margin, how are firms to know the habits of their suppliers and customers? In the real world of unpredictability the disclosures demanded by the SEC introduces more risk into capital markets. The cost of compliance for a hedge fund managing a billion dollars costs around six million dollars a year. the opportunity cost has to be the market rate of return. When implemented, I suspect compliance costs will substantially increase.    I am very happy to be retired from my former trade of corporate lawyer. One of my tasks was preparing my clients annual SEC filings. My clients were small public companies. One of them was a chain of 20 to 30 sitdown restaurants in the \"casual dinning\" sector (not fast food not white table cloth).They probably could have disclosed how much natural gas and how much electricity they purchased every year, but telling you what their emissions were? Good lord, they were chefs not engineers.But the idea of disclosing: \"GHG emissions from ... downstream activities in its value chain\" is downright funny. \"We estimate that the food consumed in our restaurants produced 100,000 pounds of poopoo and 100,000 gallons of peepee. Additionally we sold 50,000 servings of bean chili that produced 10,000 cubic feet of intestinal gas containing 70% methane which is a very potent GHG.Our government is being run by lunatics. It is not a good feeling while the Russians are brandishing nuclear weapons while they murder innocent civilians. The Fed and SEC entering climate policy-making...seems like using a hammer to garden with.I have an idea. If we wish to reduce carbon emissions, let us tax fuel consumption. Preferably in exchange for lower wage taxes...but hey, why reward productive behavior? This seems to mirror the conflict minerals disclosure which seems to be required of all companies, given the number of annual reports with a section that basically says \"we don't manufacture anything so don't use minerals.\" Barron's sees that the SEC is using regulation to dictate climate policy:https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-climate-risk-disclosure-rule-51647880796\"SEC Unveils New Rules to Combat Climate Change\" By Lauren Foster FollowUpdated March 21, 2022 6:07 pm ET / Original March 21, 2022 12:41 pm ET Thw Western world has been going mad for decades, this is just an extension of the self-destructive trend. This really seems like an overreaction to disclosure rules. I would understand such criticisms about a extensive regulation of alleged \"climate risks\", but this outcry just because companies will be required to disclose their environmental performance is excessive and sounds more like a pretext for anti-climate regulation than a serious point of substance. ESG investing is a real thing, whether you like it or not. And ESG investors need information on environmental performance of companies. What is wrong with giving such investors a sound information basis? This allows better matching of demand and supply. Since when is Mr Cochrane against efficient markets? I lost 7 figures on HQS, a microcap Chinese tilipia farm on AMEX. Total fraud. SEC did nothing. Worthless. CEO, or anyone else didn't even get their wrist slapped. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/857073/000119312510207346/dex991.htm \n\n\nComments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

In contrast, the American public will likely switch their attention away once the war ends and there is some other news. Why could not Ukraine stay a neutral country that is friendly to both the West and Russia? This would have been great for the Ukrainian economy, Ukraine would have kept Crimea and there would have been no war now. Ukrainians want to join the EU, and Russia has not opposed this (e.g., it does not oppose Serbia joining the EU). As for NATO, why to hurry and ignore Russian position? This could have been postponed for, say, 50 years until Putin is gone and Russia becomes more democratic. What a blunder! The West did not act in the best interest of Ukraine, while claiming to be its friend, and even Ukrainian politicians did not, probably because they listened to their Western advisors too much.   Why? Because Ukraine is a free and independent nation and has the right to decide for themselves what countries that want to align themselves with. NATO is not an organization that has a history of aggression with its neighbors and is, in fact, founded on the notion of providing a defense against Soviet Union aggression (now Russia), which does in fact not only has a long standing of aggression against its neighbors but continues to have a goal of world-wide hegemony. Ukrainians have been subject to the Russian way of life and they have independently voted to reject it. By what thinking does Putin believe he has the 'right' to upend the wishes of more than 40 million people. \n\n\nComments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog If the above embed doesn't work, direct link here at the Hover website, along with podcast for audiophiles.  Niall touched on it briefly a bit: the role of desperation.Remember, The Third Reich came to power because Germany had embraced a man who they believed would return them to greatness. Germany was once the home of mystics in Europe and home of the Rational Enlightenment. But the crushing economic obligations placed upon the Germans to prevent the resurgence of a belligerent European power ended up blowing up in their faces. Why? Desperation has a way of pushing people to the edge. Remember, Putin has been quoted as saying, \"If there's no Russia, why do we need the world?\"The other mistake I see, again, comes from lessons in WWII. Letting Adolf run amok in Europe for years led to a very, very, very BAD conflict later on. I'm concerned NATO is allowing the same thing with Putin. Regardless of which outcome comes forth, it will be rooted in desperation and avoiding shame. China is certainly taking notes on everything being done on both sides. And, today! Saudi Arabia will accept the Yuan for oil. Bye bye petro dollar? It was a good episode.  Mike Gallagher comes across as an impressive person & HR was in his element.  I prefer the Goodfellas episodes with someone who has real knowledge about something -- rather than people who are professional yakkers.  Thanks for an interesting conversation. Niall Ferguson seemed to be the most informed and closest to the reality, which is to be expected, as a historian he knows the history of the conflict and the history of Ukraine and Russia. I am glad that John seemed to back up on enforcement of a no-fly-zone, and he ruled out bombing Moscow. It would be nice if the conversation discussed the events leading to the war, such as USA arguments, Ukrainian arguments, Russian arguments, NATO expansion, and other major relevant events. Well, I guess this would be out of scope and would take too much time.  Great episode - highly recommended! Impression:  The U.S. military is becoming less capable, not more capable, according to the participants in this latest Goodfellows segment.  H.R. McMillan: Give the Ukrainian forces medium-range surface-to-air and surface-to-ship missiles to create a no-fly zone above Ukraine.  N. Fergusson: The conflict in the Ukraine is part of a larger developing conflict; limiting the discussion to theaters, such as the Ukraine, the Middle-East, or Indo-Pacific regions, is an incorrect approach.  M. Galligher: The direction that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff are headed is entirely wrong and misguided--focus on the present and near-term needs/risks; the Biden administration's emphasis on climate change is doing great damage to the economy and the ability of the nation to contend with these risks.The discussion was informative.  It presented four perspectives and some useful alternatives, but fell short of a consensus on a coherent strategy to be followed due to lack of time.Thanks for posting the video. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://sites.dartmouth.edu/dirwin/\" target=\"_blank\">Doug Irwin </a>of Dartmouth gave a really informative talk at the Hoover Economic Policy Working Group, based on his paper <a href=\"https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/pandp-2022-1048-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Trade Reform Wave 1985-1995</a>, AER May 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;Embed (hopefully) below, or go to <a href=\"https://www.hoover.org/events/policy-seminar-douglas-irwin\" target=\"_blank\">the link here</a>. &nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Doug opened my eyes, hence this post. I love learning something new. I'm a resolute Free Trader. So, naturally, I jump to the answer: Stop protecting industries. Get rid of tariffs. Don't bother with the negotiated mercantilism of trade deals -- the \"you can sell to us if our exporters can sell to you\" deals. The point of a foreign country's exports is to get dollars, and the point of dollars is for them to buy from the US. Full stop.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Doug reveals that this story is far too simplistic to understand the closed economies of the 1950s through 1970s, and the great trade liberalization that the world experienced starting in the 1980s -- and which we are very sadly likely to lose in the years ahead. A little reminder of what we gained, and a sad peak:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhc08U26yJOgDRn5NxJYCdXv4JGKHAD9ZenWn2Yc1lXWltsZKVFEyKRxa5ga1OPuX7iJcsmtrn6rRSCOUFuxOUT8xLshDhmGoMy8W_rX4tMZ7aALNpvBZWoA_EZt7kdsoCW-kQ-SpeECcMz5Z5_hETe68ohzrTeJJ-76gGRQyQRWfQOF5uFh3zUH0c=s2310\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhc08U26yJOgDRn5NxJYCdXv4JGKHAD9ZenWn2Yc1lXWltsZKVFEyKRxa5ga1OPuX7iJcsmtrn6rRSCOUFuxOUT8xLshDhmGoMy8W_rX4tMZ7aALNpvBZWoA_EZt7kdsoCW-kQ-SpeECcMz5Z5_hETe68ohzrTeJJ-76gGRQyQRWfQOF5uFh3zUH0c=w400-h233\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div>The process of liberalization started with money, not tariffs: Countries first devalued overvalued currency, usually to a floating rate. Then they eliminated quantitative restrictions on imports including import licenses. Then they reduced tariffs.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>In turn, how did they get there, and why did they not reform earlier? The standard story pits domestic industry vs. consumers. Domestic industries have concentrated interest in protection, consumers are diffuse. That accounts for status quo bias, but not why they eventually changed.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The source of the problem, and reason for the change is different. Countries (especially in the \"developing\" world) were hit with a \"terms of trade\" shock -- they exported commodities, say, to import goods; the commodity price went down so they could not buy imports. Many countries were financing imports with foreign aid and borrowing, and those transfers dried up.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>What do they do? They have to choose between deflation, currency depreciation, or import controls. &nbsp;Deflation at the same exchange rate makes foreign goods more expensive. Depreciation does the same, without changing the domestic price level. Or, stop imports by direct controls, and by rationing foreign exchange leading to a black market. In the early postwar view, consistent with Bretton Woods, they chose the latter. (Why is there so much nostalgia for Bretton Woods? It was a rotten system.)&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Naturally, it didn't work. Eventually they gave up and devalued or floated the exchange rate. Now there is no need to ration foreign exchange or to restrict imports by license. (Tariffs are bad, but quantitative restrictions are worse, since you never know what the cost is, and then imports are allocated by political rather than economic reasons. Just paying a tax is more efficient!) They moved to exports in order to generate foreign exchange to buy imports.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhn1W-sFxGS884lqGrqtganTnIfEAzxWfVV5ZypzGEsDZCRSnWQyJ8_U-YjVeNzeJIaqG-aXmNiR2qvzLsrsaLbdT2D6v_g_r7nJCMbY0jv1LEl7083ihkphyypC_YlVigJ97B7Z_0evHHASOuuuTaM6uDeJpMoDtEHa2nVDU8dkkA6wYaBP5AH4is=s1676\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"290\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhn1W-sFxGS884lqGrqtganTnIfEAzxWfVV5ZypzGEsDZCRSnWQyJ8_U-YjVeNzeJIaqG-aXmNiR2qvzLsrsaLbdT2D6v_g_r7nJCMbY0jv1LEl7083ihkphyypC_YlVigJ97B7Z_0evHHASOuuuTaM6uDeJpMoDtEHa2nVDU8dkkA6wYaBP5AH4is=w400-h290\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgYq6cg9k7AOWF1JtFesWMo11nffi3fH2xp-ONr_JfFLmfcY0usGboqY0SAmPUfQ559l05RNT9OLkywLHj-xTevcDDLgWFGjHzay-2OvL_CdcKtD1GXuI9czRFeWt__CogzClv8bkvGBWiIBGSWt5N8xdc0XYT8hrnt7ooPqUAFCaCxJt6_hSztG-I=s1548\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"346\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgYq6cg9k7AOWF1JtFesWMo11nffi3fH2xp-ONr_JfFLmfcY0usGboqY0SAmPUfQ559l05RNT9OLkywLHj-xTevcDDLgWFGjHzay-2OvL_CdcKtD1GXuI9czRFeWt__CogzClv8bkvGBWiIBGSWt5N8xdc0XYT8hrnt7ooPqUAFCaCxJt6_hSztG-I=w400-h346\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div>So, Doug answers the central question:&nbsp;</div><blockquote><div>Why no reform in 1970s? \u201cforeign exchange reserves kill the will to reform\u201d&nbsp;</div></blockquote><div>Oil and commodity export countries were flush with cash to buy imports.

Doug's answer was interesting: In these cases, a free currency market was crucial, but free capital markets less so.\u00a0 Thanks for your -as always- instructive content. Is there any way I can receive your posts in my email automatically? Something like a newsletter? The conversation session captured in the video serves to remind us that the U.S. and most other countries are 'open economies' to a greater or lesser degree. As such, 'closed-economy' models, such as the three-equation new Keynesian DSGE model, are inapplicable to much of the World's economies. Fiscal policy interacts with monetary policy and balance of payments in open economies, as is well known.  In a closed economy, the interaction with the balance of payments is absent (no imports or exports of goods or capital occur in a closed economy).  One could argue that taken as a whole, the global economy is a 'closed economy' and, as a consequence, the three-equation new Keynesian DSGE model would apply if there was but one fiscal and one monetary authority. That ideal does not exist at present, of course, and the three-equation new Keynesian DSGE model remains a theoretical curiosity for the present.  Where does the fiscal theory of the price level fit in an open-economy model?  It does fit, but it requires modification to take into consideration balance of payment constraints and international capital flows because the economic system is open.  Theoretical thermodynamics, for example, distinguishes between a closed system in which there is no interchange between the system and the environment not in the system, and an open system in which interchange with the surrounding environment is a material part of the system dynamics.  Most published papers on the FTPL base their analyses on closed economic system dynamics.  Adaptation of the FTPL to open economies would broaden and deepen the applicability of the theory to the practical issues facing modern economies.  Thanks for posting the video it was most educational and served as a welcome refresher course for international business and international finance graduate courses taken forty-years ago. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

Reassure people in the US who do not want to see greater help for Ukraine. Push up those poll numbers. For once, please, ignore the polls. Govern wisely and quietly. Only one poll counts, at the next election.\u00a0 MAD was always questionable game theory. If Russia blows up a city in Europe, why would NATO murder tens of millions of Russian civilians in response? A hardy conventional response was always important.\u00a0 But at least the rules of the game were clear: The nuclear threat is respected for invasions of a country that has them, or invasions of allies such as NATO. Nuclear threats do not apply to invasions of third countries. Yes, we do what we can to keep the conflict contained, often at great cost, as in Vietnam. But we do not as a matter of principle rule out any action.\u00a0 *** Update: Of course the swiftness and severity of economic sanctions are big news of the last few weeks. How will Xi Jinping read that? I note that much of what's going on now are private, voluntary sanctions; a general refusal to do business with Russia because so many people and corporations are rightly outraged about this invasion. \u00a0Now, what will happen if China invades Taiwan? Will people around the world see the same outrage? Even the US officially regards China and Taiwan as one country. Will they be willing to do without the much larger and more crucial amount of Chinese manufactured goods? For how long?\u00a0   \u00a0 These comments are not aimed at Russia. They are aimed at the local population, who are no longer treated as citizens, but a constituency to be pacified and shielded from any disturbing truths. I would hardly call it \"pacifying\" to communicate clearly to our soldiers (many of whom, including some of my neighbors, have already had their Eastern European deployments extended indefinitely) that the U.S. does not plan on becoming involved in direct military conflict with Russia, e.g. a no-fly-zone. I'm not claiming that's the wisest strategy, and as it happens, I agree with John that this is a circumstance where ambiguity is likely superior. \"But given this decision, why rule it out? Why say it out loud? Why make it a matter of principle, now a doctrine?\"Let's not be cavalier about these decisions: there are thousands of military families out there who would be much more anxious right now if Biden were less ambiguous. John, that's one reason why. Is it enough? Probably not, in my opinion. But it isn't nothing. And it's just my nearly-worthless strategic decision. I appreciate your concern, but the military is expected to operate under ambiguity, which should obviate your argument against leaving the NFZ on the table. While military families might complain about their concerns, they're neither a large nor concentrated constituency to matter in that regard, and the all-volunteer force is free to end their service at the end of every contract. Anxiety is par for the course for military families, and the successful ones learn to live with the uncertainty. How will the market react to news that escalates the war or even keeps it ambiguous? poorly. Haven't they done enough to us the last few years? To be clear, I mean the university intellectual class and politicians and their ridiculous lockdowns.  How about we sit this one out so we can afford to save for your generation's very expensive retirement, and maybe even start families of our own. Old grumpy boomers can still indoctrinate the next generation from cozy armchairs in the 2030s, for now, they need to admit they messed up (even if tacitly like Biden is doing) and need to begin accepting their retirement from the world stage. This administration is short its Henry Kissinger in these negotiations.  I fear that all these digital world people do not understand that the analog world is not the same as their digital models. In the analog world, your adversary gets a say, too.   In terms of Taiwan: it does seem as though the same principle would apply. Therefore  the issue would seem to be for the US and other countries to decide *beforehand* whether they are going to support Taiwan and if so have an official presence there so it would be *China* that risks stepping over the line to incite war with a nuclear power (or powers) and that may prevent it from doing so. It seems your frustration is that you'd like to be able to see them continue their waffling and be able to be drawn into it at a later date if needed without being blamed for stepping in and perhaps triggering a nuclear war. You acknowledge that despite thinking \"MAD was always questionable game theory. \" you imply its good that \"But at least the rules of the game were clear\". So its odd that you are puzzled about the idea of at least partial clarity this time regarding the rules (even if not complete clarity): \"Why say it out loud?... They could simply not do it, and keep Putin guessing.  \"Unfortunately the rules Putin will follow aren't clear. Its not clear whether he will view sanctions that are too harsh or the provision of weapons as a justification for attacking NATO and broadening the war. However its seems clear that any direct conflict like a no-fly zone has always been considered actual involvement in a war so it makes sense to avoid that. I suspect if Nato had troops in Ukraine or Ukraine was part of Nato that this war wouldn't have happened: but frustrated regret in hindsight of what you'd have liked to see doesn't justify increasing the risk of nuclear conflict now.  I think you miss the entire point of this administration.  Your assumption that they actually care about the same things you care about is based on the false premise.  Just as one example, an administration that would seek to buy oil from Iran and Venezuela, suppress domestic production, voice opposition to the East Med  pipeline that would supply Greece and Cyprus with Israeli Natural gas is not an administration that cares about promoting the economic and strategic health of America and its democratic allies either now or in the future.  If one looks at the refusal to change course on these suicidal energy and environmental policies I can not see how one could come to any other conclusion.  No one can be that na\u00efve or incompetent.  Damage was caused by some of the reckless statements of the previous administration but this damage may be irreparable. I disagree with the deterrence logic from China's perspective. If the U.S. had said 'maybe we will fight for Ukraine, maybe we won't', then didn't fight, that would encourage China. Saying outright 'we won't fight in Ukraine' still preserves the strategic ambiguity in Taiwan. 100%, surprise that we do not have more people seeing that fact, this is not about Ukraine, it is about normal world Vs world in which dictators do what they want... by not getting involved out of fear we virtually guarantee future nuclear war.. Fear is gasoline for dictators, it is drug like drug, sex and everything else.. fear fuels them...  Your point on China is a good one and says something deeper about sanctions.  A sanction is not a one-way street.  The \"sanctioner\" suffers as does the \"sanctionee\".  If the sanctioner is large with many other alternative trading partners and the sanctionee is small then sanctions can work - to a degree.  When the sanctionee is your largest trading partner and a large holder of your country's debt the notion that sanctions are viable is silly on its face.  If the US even mentioned sanctions in the case of China, Xi Jingping should just laugh out loud and invite them.  Oh - OK, in that case we would like to redeem rather than roll over all the debt we are holding - ok?  How would that be for a \"sanction\"? There is a major global doctrine that should be questioned: the idea that its a war crime to assassinate heads of state like Putin. Admittedly its unlikely to be claimed: but you still have to wonder how many $billions the Ukraine government could raise from global contributors as a bounty for Putin's head in hopes it might turn insiders against him.  There are innocent people suffering in the Ukraine, and now collateral economic damage to innocent by standards in Russia and around the world since sanctions hurt both sides.  @Anonymous:Where is that written? Yamamoto?  One source talking about the general issue and mentioning US prohibitions on it:https://lieber.westpoint.edu/assassination-law-of-war/\"ASSASSINATION IN THE LAW OF WAR... In 1977, following revelations of U.S. lethal targeting operations and ensuing Church (Senate) and the Pike (House) Committee hearings, President Gerald Ford issued Executive Order 11,905. The order prohibited Executive Branch personnel from engaging in, or conspiring to engage in, political assassination. Subsequent administrations continued the ban. Four years later, President Regan issued Executive Order 12,333, which, as amended, remains in effect today. It contains the same prohibition, although it limits application to individuals \u201cacting on behalf of\u201d the U.S. government.\" The only purpose in declaring a \"no-fly zone\" over the Ukraine is to destroy the aggressor's assets on the ground.  At present, the Russian Federation does not control Ukrainian air-space -- it, the air-space, is still contested by the Russians and the Ukrainians.  Given that the Ukraine is nearer Russia than it is nearer the U.S., maintaining a \"no-fly\" zone against Russian air force planes over the Ukraine is logistically challenging--the U.S. air force assets in range are based in the EU and the UK at present.  To avoid entangling the EU in the proposed \"no-fly\" zone, USAF assets would have to re-base in the Ukraine, and this is not practicable.The purpose of the announcement by the U.S. is to assure the European members of NATO that the war will not be brought home to them by USAF assets returning from bombing runs in the Ukraine.  Private assurances are not enough.And, it matters not one whit whether the announcement is made privately (in the ears of the European heads of government) or publicly---the position will be known, virtually instantly, in the Kremlin.Game this out for yourself.  You're president of the U.S., and your opponent is V. V. Putin, president of the Russian Federation.  Your assets are dispersed, not concentrated; his are dispersed and concentrated.  You have B-22 bombers; he has SAMs and hypersonic cruise missiles.  He has much to gain by subjugating the Ukraine; you have very little to gain by preventing that subjugation.  He has little to lose if he fails to overrun the Ukraine; you have much to lose if the war widens and deepens to involve all of Europe, the UK, and eventually North America.  The trade analysis needs to be made in a state of sang-froid, not the hot-blooded heat of the moment.I mentioned earlier that the population of the Ukraine is 42 millions, and the adult population between the ages of 18 yrs. and 60 yrs. is roughly 10 millions, and if 10% of those 10 millions will serve in the army to repulse the aggressor, the Ukraine could field 1 million fighters.  What is lacking is armaments--small arms and anti-tank weaponry.  Given the armaments etc. the man-power ratio would then be 5-to-1 in favour of the Ukrainians.  The road from Poland is still open.  Make use of it, before you stagger/blunder into a fight that will lead to a wider and longer confrontation with Russia, and possibly China/N. Korea.  As president of the United States of America, your first responsibility is to the United States of America, and to fill that role you must harden your heart and engage your brain.  The Ukraine must do this for itself.  This is their \"trial by fire\", just as the Revolutionary War and the Civil War were the U.S.'s own \"trial by fire\" struggles.   It's worth mentioning that the Soviet Union (when it still existed) spent over 9 years (1979-1989) trying to subjugate the Afghans.  And that it is when the Soviets were at the height of their economic and political power.For context, the US Revolutionary War was 7 years long and the US Civil War was 4 years long.I don't see this war going on more than two years with continued worldwide economic sanctions against Russia.  The Ruble will become worthless, Russia will be cut off from most (all?) economic markets, and I doubt Putin will live that long. It is idle to speculate on the duration of a conflict such as the Russian Federation's invasion of the Ukraine.  The aggressor has specific objectives that he seeks to attain.  The defender, likewise, has specific objectives he must realize to remain independent.  While the conflict rages and broadens across the Ukraine, the window for compromise becomes narrower and narrower, but the prospects of resolution by the parties increase.  When will the conflict end?  This year, not later than June or July, if that long.The RUR is freely floating and transactions in the RUR comprise but 1.1% of international transactions.  The value of the RUR will be largely tempered by the dependency of the world on commodity exports from both the Russia Federation and the Ukraine.Sanctions will curtail Russian exports somewhat, but as you can plainly see in the case of petroleum and natural gas commodity exports, curtailment is problematical for the EU and europe as a whole.  Even for the U.S., banning imports of oil from Russia poses some problems (drives petroleum fuel prices higher).  For non-energy commodities, it is notable that both Russia and the Ukraine are exporters of small grains which find demand in the Middle East, and in Africa which is especially dependent on those export sources for much of their imports of foodstuffs.  For metals, Russia is a significant source of nickel and aluminum and copper--metals that are used in the fabrication of EV components, for example.  Disruption of the flow of any or all of those commodities (energy, food, and metals) is problematic for international trade and global economic growth.  Sanctioning food exports from Russia is fraught with collateral problems (destablizing Africa for example).  When one considers the source of processed rare-earth elements and the basic commodities, the western countries are not today uniquely endowed or in a position to maintain such sanctions over the long run.  Ergo, sanctions are more of a political P.R. issue than a 'lever' to be used to bring the conflict to an end. That is especially the case in the U.K. and in Canada today.Count on V. V. Putin being around and in power for quite a bit longer than any of the current roster of democratically elected officials leading the western powers will be.  The Fates are fickle that way. \"MAD was always questionable game theory. If Russia blows up a city in Europe, why would NATO murder tens of millions of Russian civilians in response?\"Why not? There was no certainty. That's enough. Nobody wanted to accept the risk.Yes, nuclear powers don't fight directly with each other. Yes, everybody get nukes.Ukraine might have been settled by 2014. We will not know. Looks like the chance is gone, and it's not worth a war to fix it.Only current hope is the unexpected incompetence of Russian forces. The word murder does a lot of work in that quote. The answer is not retaliating is surrendering. Tit for Tat is a superior strategy for inducing cooperation. Surrender just invites abuse. Weakness is provocative.  \"Tit for Tat is a superior strategy for inducing cooperation\"That's probably true if you are playing a repeating game with multiple rounds. If you are playing the game only once I don't see the superiority of the strategy. Surrender is a superior one in any count (a much more desirable end game ... literally!!) @El emperador desnudo:\u201cYou were given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor and you will have war.\u201dChurchill  @Fat manA conventional war is a complete different animal. We were talking about MAD, and stragegy that works until it does not. I suppose that's right in the context of a game and threats.  But I find US moves very disturbing. Mutual deterrence, another game, works by equivalent threats of execution.  Nuclear arms in Ukraine shortens the time to strike Russia. In the same way, that Russian missiles in Cuba threatened US first strike capability.  Second, we're now talking about arming Ukrainian civilians, after making clear we're not going to do anything. Not a good thing to set up untrained civilians to fight/die for a superpower's geopolitical interests, especially when it's  not fighting for them, or doesn't have that strong an interest.  US led Ukraine down the garden path, then dumped them. And 3rd, there are ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine that didn't agree to the government installed after the 2014 coup. Everybody in Washington thinks in binaries. You are all in or all out. There are lots of other possibilities. How about \"leasing\" some UAVs to Ukraine and painting them Blue and yellow. Some of them can carry missiles. Those missiles may not be able to take out a tank, but taking out a food truck or a fuel truck might be just as good at this stage. If one of them is shot down, there is no pilot for the Russians to torture. Work on the assumption that this is not an idea that has crossed the mind of anyone in the Administration whose job requires Senate Confirmation. Where is the push from the US or the EU or the \"International Community\" to resolve this conflict?  Instead, all the parties who would normally be trying to calm things down are pumping up the violence.It is clear that Russia does not want to occupy the Ukraine.  All they want is to make sure that NATO (i.e. US) does not plant offensive weapons on their border.  Given how JFK responded to the Cuban situation, Russia's stated aims seem quite reasonable.Why are we not seeing any diplomatic effort to (1) assure Russia that the Ukraine will never be part of NATO, and (2) assure the Ukraine that it can achieve the happy prosperous situation of Finland?  Does the lack of a constructive US & Western response have anything to do with the well-established corruption in the Ukraine that reached even to Biden's family?This is not to defend Russia's invasion of the Ukraine.  But we need to ask ourselves -- what other options did \"Our Guys\" give Russia when they repeatedly ignored clearly stated Russian concerns? Exactly You're putting too much stock in the premise that other countries believe the US consistently uses force according to set norms or 'rules'. It's hard to imagine any country taking these no-fly statements as 'doctrine' given the chaotic record of US armed forces' interventions. Obtaining nukes has been a goal for Iran and others for decades for their obvious leverage, I have no idea why this changes anything. John, you will never make it as a diplomat or military strategist.  You have taken the President at his word.  Didn\u2019t he also say he would not invoke SWIFT sanctions?...or a ban on Russian oil/gas?  And now he says \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d with regard to a ban on oil/gas.  It is all part of his strategic ambiguity; clarity is not to be forthcoming and does not serve our interest.  Putin plays chess; Biden plays poker. \u2013 What is your next move? What is your next bidding?  Let\u2019s go tit-for-tat up that escalation ladder.I think the object is to draw out the war for weeks and months.  The longer it goes, the more Putin\u2019s hand is weakened.  In a possible confrontation between two nuclear powers, there is no need for America to rachet up the escalation in only the third week of the conflict.  We will go step-by-step; we and our NATO partners have a lot more cards to play.  Ukrainians have a long struggle ahead of them.  Their liberty will be seared in blood, and it will be their sacrifice that proves victorious, and not NATO or America winning the fight for them.  Did the French win our Revolution?  [Next to our Civil War, the American Revolution was our bloodiest.] You are getting out of your lane again; your economic comments are interesting; your poly sci not so much. How are Blinken's comments about Ukraine the equivalent of a doctrine. They are statements about the level of intervention in Ukraine now.They say nothing about Taiwan other than that which is already known: we would rather not be involved but might in certain circumstances. Even in Ukraine if Russia used tactical nukes, they can have no confidence in what NATO would do even though Ukraine is not a member. The fact US Senators are even advocating for a NFZ in Ukraine now for the first time is evidence that US determination to stay out could chsnge. \"They are making a judgement that Ukraine can survive without it, and that the extra death and destruction in Ukraine is not worth the risk\"There is no way of sustaining this judgement from a utilitarian or moral perspective without sustaining that the destruction of Poland or even the US is not worth the riskYou certainly could think that the lives of Ukrainian civilians that are going to be lost in Ukraine are worth less that the lives that could be lost in a nuclear conflict times the risks of the conflict escalating to a nuclear war. And you can arrive at the same position using moral judgement.Now, in the original statement, you change \"Ukrainian civilians\" for \"Polish civilians\" or, even, for \"American civilians\" and nothing should change in your utilitarian calculations (or in your \"moral\" judgement). So, your conclusion should still be, that saving those Polish or American lives by stablishing a no-fly zone is not worth risking a full nuclear war.The only way of justifying engaging Russia to avoid Polish or American casualties but not engaging Russia to avoid Ukrainian casualties on moral or utilitarian grounds is by placing a higher value in an American or Polish civilian life than in a Ukrainian one.I find this proposition very difficult to defend from both a moral and a utilitarian perspective. Well, if NATO introduces a no-fly zone and starts shooting down Russian jets, then Russia will be shooting down NATO planes and hitting NATO airports (presumably in Poland and Romania). What's next? I guess next we will read a John's blog post asking \"Why rule out nuking Moscow?\". John, you need to treat all lives -- Americans, Ukrainians (including those who live in Donbass), Russians, Iraqis, Libyans, Afghans, etc -- equally. Basic concepts: 10 lives lost are 10 time more pain and horror than 1 live lost (no matter what the nationalities are), lives of children and women are far more valuable than lives of men, and so on. Hope you do not believe that there are people who are more equal than other people. How sane. Thank you. I would like to see same equal treatment or judiciousness with sanctions. Syrian friends suffering from US sanctions, freezing with 1 hour on/5 hours off electricity. A Russian friend from grad school whose STEM papers are now rejected bc of Ukraine. The sanctions fallout - madness of firing/deleting artists:  Anna Netrebko, Gergieve, Dostoevsky, Tschaikovsky... Minor disagreement: Syria invited both Iran and Russia, did not invite US who established base at al Tanf, confiscated oil fields,elsewhere in NE Syria If Putin believes the US will impose a no-fly zone and that this will lead to escalation, then Putin might not want to wait until the NFZ is imposed but may instead choose to escalate right now in response to what the US is already doing: sharing intelligence and weapons with Ukraine. If there's such a thing as pre-escalation, declaring the no-fly zone off the table could prevent it. It seems there is a supply/demand partial solution to Russia's aggression. I suspect declining oil prices, now highly inelastic, would make Russia less bellicose. The Soviet economy cratered when oil declined from $75 bbl in 1980 to $22 bbl in 1986. By 1989 when the Soviets left Afghanistan, crude oil  averaged about $19 bbl. They were bankrupt. According to the WSJ, 7% of our oil imports come from Russia. Why not increase domestic production so as to lower oil equilibrium prices.  NATO and the US cannot and should not enforce a no-fly zone. Blinken as well as NATO stating that is simply common sense, both for NATO servicemen and women as well as to avoid wrong expectations. From a country that invaded other countries without any justification ('weapons-of-mass destruction' anybody?). Decisions about war are rarely about morals obviously (Saddam used to be an esteemed ally of the US as long as his ire was directed at Iran). Back of the envelope strategists can bring their vast experience in nuclear warfare to bear extending beyond Mutually-Assured-Destruction, which I just learned has not worked (because ???).  \"Message to Iran: test one nuclear weapon. Invade Syria, Iraq, or whatever. The US will not respond.\"This literally happened and the Obama administration did nothing and most everyone was on board. Except it wasn't just Iran that invaded Syria and threw money and weapons and soldiers there, it was also Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Bahrain. All the while these states had plausible deniability but anyone that says they were not involved in the conflict does not deserve to have their opinion taken seriously.I'm kind of looking at everything everyone is doing to Russia right now and wondering \"we do this to the entire Middle East in 2015, is the Syrian War over in a week?\" Hello Professor John Cochrane. Completely wrong analysis. You seem to think that instead of announcing it publicly that U.S. will not enter into direct conflict with Russia, Biden administration should have privately communicated it to Putin. Have you considered the situation that the Biden administration would not be able to deliver on its private assurances, because of rapid geopolitical developments as well as capriciousness of public opinion in reaction to them. This is what a democracy looks like. The days of Dr. Strangelove or John Von Neumann suggesting nuclear strategies based on game theory are long over. So called geniuses doing dumb things. Best approach is to use democratic means to convince both sides -- Ukraine and Russia -- that there is plenty of upside in giving up the war. A principal of negotiation is to not make concessions for free.That said, from what I've heard from subject area experts, an enforceable no fly zone is not practical.\"I don't think people are seriously considering this, but a no fly zone is a de facto declaration of war... an enforceable no fly zone is a commitment to a kinetic military engagement with Russian forces.\" -- Stanford's Michael Kofmanhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4uHZPFuI1o&t=2584sIn that talk, Ward Carroll of the US Naval Institute also makes the point that combat air patrols above Ukraine would be in range of the S400 SAM sites that ring the western border of Russia. Those could be soft killed (whatever that means?), but \"the one thing that would be an act of war, if your SAMs are getting soft killed and your only response is now air to air warfare, now you're going to get one of your airplanes shot down and then your next move is to declare war on whatever country it was or NATO...\" He continues, \"... it [a no fly zone] is just not practical, and I don't think we're going to have a UN resolution, because you need that, and you need local air superiority to do it, and we don't have either of those things at this point.\" I\u2019m surprised at the shallowness of your concept of the geopolitical situation with respect to China.  The Chinese and Xi aren\u2019t like Putin and his quack cronies.  Their understanding of the geopolitical situation isn\u2019t restricted to threat / no threat.  They understand the subtleties of economics and appearances much more deeply than the Putin regime and no doubt have a more accurate concept of the relative strengths and weaknesses of their military position.  They surely recognize that, in the eyes of the US, Ukraine and Taiwan aren\u2019t remotely comparable.  The US has *very* strong historical ties across the Pacific - Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Korea, Viet Nam, Australia, numerous small island nations - and none in Ukraine.  The US would be stupid to tie down assets and resources in Ukraine that could otherwise protect Taiwan.  China understands that.   China would *rather* the US get wrapped up in Ukraine and leave Taiwan exposed.  Europe and the US should already be thinking globally.  Europe has by far the most substantial strategic interest in protecting Ukraine and the geopolitical position to do so, so it should be Europe that carries the load on Ukraine.    In this sense China and/or Russia might recognize that NATO is in some respects a ball and chain for Europe.  While the US can act independently in the Pacific, NATO action in Europe must be restricted because it would draw the US into the conflict.  But at this point Europe has no prepared means to act as a unit independent of NATO, so there is little chance of a direct military response.   I've determined you know nothing of how the FED works, (from an earlier article) now I know that you know nothing of how the world works. Seems to me you're an over educated leftist (you probably voted for that senile old grifter who currently pretends to occupy the oval office)and in these times when leftist want to destroy the U.S. that sure makes you a traitor. What do we do with traitors during a time of war??? MAD is questionable. Of course. But remember, if you make a mistake, if your rational calculus is mistaken, then it is the end. So, please consider nuclear strategy seriously and take a pessimistic outlook. Any NATO intervention and we could be in this nightmare. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

It's not the first, and it won't be the last on the issue!&nbsp;</p><p><i>Now that surging inflation has refocused everyone's attention on the long-ignored supply side of the economy, the question is how best to support broad-based growth, efficiency, and innovation. The answer is not necessarily deregulation, but the need for smarter regulation is increasingly apparent \u2013 even to progressives.</i></p><p>STANFORD \u2013 The return of inflation is an economic cold shower. Governments can no longer hope to solve problems by throwing money at them. Economic policy must now turn its attention to supply and its cousin, economic efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue is deeper than delayed goods deliveries and a year\u2019s worth of sharp price increases. From the end of World War II to 2000, US real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita grew 2.3% per year, from $14,171 to $44,177 (in 2012 dollars). Americans became healthier, lived longer, reduced poverty, and paid for a much cleaner environment and a vast array of social programs. But since 2000, that post-war growth rate has fallen almost by half, to 1.4% per year. And it\u2019s worse in Canada and Europe, where many countries have not grown at all since 2010 on a per capita basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing matters more for human flourishing than long-term economic growth. So, no economic trend is more worrisome than growth falling by half, especially for the well-being of the less fortunate.&nbsp;</p><p>The eruption of inflation settles a long debate. Sclerotic growth is not the result of demand-side \u201csecular stagnation,\u201d fixable only with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. Sclerotic growth is a supply problem. We need policies to increase the economy\u2019s productive capacity \u2013 either directly or by reducing costs.&nbsp;</p><p>How? The simplest and most important thing governments can do is to get out of the way. Byzantine regulations and capricious regulatory authorities stymie business. We do not need thoughtless deregulation, but rather smarter regulation that is simple, effective, avoids disincentives and unintended consequences, and is not distorted to protect current business and prop up regulatory empires. That means adding sunset clauses to regulations, regularly re-evaluating existing measures, and instituting a right to external appeal.&nbsp;<span></span></p><a name=\"more\"></a><p></p><p>The United States needs infrastructure. The problem is not money. The problem is that building anything in America has become almost impossible, owing to the thicket of regulations and lawsuits that will stop or drive up the costs of any project.&nbsp;</p><p>Start by repealing the Jones Act, a 1920 law that requires all intrastate shipping to use expensive US merchant marine vessels (in practice, it is the \u201cSend It by Truck Act\u201d). Repeal the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts, which deliberately add to the costs of building highways. Reform the National Environmental Policy Act, which allows people to sue to stop and delay projects on specious environmental grounds. Overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Not one new nuclear plant has been built since the NRC was founded in 1975.&nbsp;</p><p>Protectionism reduces supply. Tariffs and trade restrictions make products more expensive and deprive other countries of the dollars they need to buy from America. Yet the Biden administration has kept longstanding restrictions and even the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs in place.

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog At Project Syndicate\u00a0essay, with Jon Hartley. It's not the first, and it won't be the last on the issue!\u00a0 Now that surging inflation has refocused everyone's attention on the long-ignored supply side of the economy, the question is how best to support broad-based growth, efficiency, and innovation. The answer is not necessarily deregulation, but the need for smarter regulation is increasingly apparent \u2013 even to progressives. STANFORD \u2013 The return of inflation is an economic cold shower. Governments can no longer hope to solve problems by throwing money at them. Economic policy must now turn its attention to supply and its cousin, economic efficiency.\u00a0 The issue is deeper than delayed goods deliveries and a year\u2019s worth of sharp price increases. From the end of World War II to 2000, US real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita grew 2.3% per year, from $14,171 to $44,177 (in 2012 dollars). Americans became healthier, lived longer, reduced poverty, and paid for a much cleaner environment and a vast array of social programs. But since 2000, that post-war growth rate has fallen almost by half, to 1.4% per year. And it\u2019s worse in Canada and Europe, where many countries have not grown at all since 2010 on a per capita basis.\u00a0 Nothing matters more for human flourishing than long-term economic growth. So, no economic trend is more worrisome than growth falling by half, especially for the well-being of the less fortunate.\u00a0 The eruption of inflation settles a long debate. Sclerotic growth is not the result of demand-side \u201csecular stagnation,\u201d fixable only with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. Sclerotic growth is a supply problem. We need policies to increase the economy\u2019s productive capacity \u2013 either directly or by reducing costs.\u00a0 How? The simplest and most important thing governments can do is to get out of the way. Byzantine regulations and capricious regulatory authorities stymie business. We do not need thoughtless deregulation, but rather smarter regulation that is simple, effective, avoids disincentives and unintended consequences, and is not distorted to protect current business and prop up regulatory empires. That means adding sunset clauses to regulations, regularly re-evaluating existing measures, and instituting a right to external appeal.\u00a0  The United States needs infrastructure. The problem is not money. The problem is that building anything in America has become almost impossible, owing to the thicket of regulations and lawsuits that will stop or drive up the costs of any project.\u00a0 Start by repealing the Jones Act, a 1920 law that requires all intrastate shipping to use expensive US merchant marine vessels (in practice, it is the \u201cSend It by Truck Act\u201d). Repeal the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts, which deliberately add to the costs of building highways. Reform the National Environmental Policy Act, which allows people to sue to stop and delay projects on specious environmental grounds. Overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Not one new nuclear plant has been built since the NRC was founded in 1975.\u00a0 Protectionism reduces supply. Tariffs and trade restrictions make products more expensive and deprive other countries of the dollars they need to buy from America. Yet the Biden administration has kept longstanding restrictions and even the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs in place. It also doubled the tariff on imported lumber last November, just as construction costs were skyrocketing.\u00a0 High housing costs in the parts of America with good jobs create barriers to opportunity and force people to make long commutes that contribute to congestion and emissions. The cause is clear: restrictions on land use and zoning and building codes that make it impossible or expensive to build and to build densely. Rent controls help today\u2019s tenants at the expense of today\u2019s landlords, but also deny opportunities to newcomers, especially the poor, and ruin the rental housing stock.\u00a0 America\u2019s failing public schools are another barrier to opportunity and productive capacity. Again, money isn\u2019t the issue: Nationally, K-12 schools spend an average of $13,000 per student. New York\u2019s dismal public schools spend $28,000.

Nonetheless, in doing so they recognize the problem. They, or their successors, may follow with effective strategies.\u00a0 You lost me at the \"free\" trade and open borders. The Chinese have used \"free\" trade to steal our intellectual capital and gut our manufacturing. All we have gotten in return is crappy cell phones and the plague. Every cent we made off of \"free\" trade has been burned to deal with the plague. It wasn't worth it.\"Free\" trade was a great idea for the UK when Britannia ruled the wave and the sun never set on the British Empire, and for the US in the aftermath of the Cold War. But now the world has gotten real again. It is the world of Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Hobbes.Trade is now a tool of foreign policy not part of economic policy. I do think we should remove all trade barriers with those of our allies that are democratic and committed to the rule of law. To me USMCA does not go far enough, and we should have similar agreements with Japan, Australia, the UK and other NATO countries.I would rather be a poor man standing on my own two feet, than a rich man on my knees kowtowing to Xi Jinping.As for your open borders idea. It suffers from many of the same defects as \"free\" trade. Yes, we need more skilled labor. No, we don't need more illiterate peasants, MS 13 members, drug dealers, or welfare drones. We also need to ensure that every able bodied American citizen has a good job at a living wage. We don't need to import workers so Hollywood executives have cheap nannies and gardeners.The \"free\" trade open borders economy has made a lot of money for urban elites who profit from investments in China and benefit from cheap domestic servants. It has devastated wide swaths of the country with joblessness, drug addiction, and hopelessness. And, it has poisoned our political and social dialog. Despite all the miracles of modern medicine life expectancies have gone down amongst the excluded classes.This is the real crisis that our idiot leftists want to label as the distribution of wealth. Piketty, like most Frenchmen is recycling the slogans of the Jacobins, 200 years after they lost all relevance. Joel Kotkin is an analyst who has a much better understanding of the nature of the crisis.  Good post by John, good rejoinder from Fat Man.  A great deal of the two posts is also applicable to Australia, although things aren't as bad here, they are still moving in the wrong direction.  I agree with much of \"Fat Man's Comment.  The US must have the most counterproductive immigration policy in the world.  We now have open borders that has allowed 2 million unvetted and unvaccinated illegal aliens into the country along with huge amounts of contraband.  Meanwhile we send home Indian Engineers with advanced degrees unless they can win the visa lottery.  Allowing a controlled flow of unskilled immigrants is fine to fill the jobs cited by Cochrane. But the current policy is a disaster. Think about the cost that will be incurred by local governments for years to come. On free trade, I could not care less if the US no longer produces low end cheap manufactured products but to cede our expertise in high end manufacturing to the mercantilist CCP is no longer tenable.  Some of the problem can be attributed to onerous environmental and other regs that discourages production of rare earth metals and other critical inputs and which can be rectified by reform.  It is a difficult path to get it right and industrial policy always becomes political and results in massive misallocation of resources.  Somehow a middle path needs to be found that balances free trade efficiencies with national security priorities as we face implacable adversaries in China and Russia. It is often forgotten that the benefits from a move to freer trade are net benefits. There are winners and there are losers, with the winners winning more than the losers lose. That doesn't make the losers happy.Compensate the losers.  @Alan K wrote: \"I could not care less if the US no longer produces low end cheap manufactured products but to cede our expertise in high end manufacturing to the mercantilist CCP is no longer tenable.\"I should begin by thanking him for his endorsement. He recognizes that some simple things such as mining rare earths have been shut down by regulatory actions. But, I think the issues are bigger and more complicated than just giving out permits. I think that the following excerpt points out that high end vs low end does not capture the complexity of the problem:\"So let's talk a bit about the synthesis of Paxlovid (PF-07321332), Pfizer's protease inhibitor drug for the coronavirus. ... Small-molecule drugs are wonderful things ... but they have logistic complications of their own. Let's list some: ...\"That multistep work means that there are a huge variety of reagents that can be involved in such syntheses, and every new drug arrives with its own list. ... this is one of the absolutely more important parts of drug production on scale: what reagents do you need, how much, and where are you going to get them? What steps of the process are going to be done where, and by whom, and for how much money? A given drug (or its constituents) can go through two, three, half a dozen facilities in completely different countries during this work ...\"... if you track almost any drug's production down to the earliest stages, you will almost invariably come to a whole bunch of offshore suppliers. These are mostly Chinese, although there are some Indian ones and other countries in the mix as well. What they tend to have in common are lower labor and capital costs and a higher tolerance for the presence of a large number of smelly, unattractive, and sometimes downright dangerous chemical production facilities. We simply do not have a lot of that capability here in the US any more; it's been declining for decades because it's so much cheaper to have someone else do it. ...\"\"Making Paxlovid\" By Derek Lowe \u2022 5 Jan 2022 \u2022 https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/making-paxlovid \u2022 Derek Lowe has a PhD in organic chemistry and has worked for several major pharmaceutical companies. He writes a blog: \"In the Pipeline\", which is hosted on the Science Magazine website. I highly recommend it. I have learned from it a great deal about the biological science behind the plague and its treatments.The implications of this situation for national security are frightening. How can we fight a war against a country that can cut off our supplies of medicines? If the Chinese Communists take over Taiwan and cut off the supply of computer chips that run our military equipment how will we resist them?I do not claim that every step of every process must be inside the the US. Some things can be in Central and South America, and others in South or Southeast Asia. But no strategic supply chain should be allowed to go through the China/Russia Axis of Evil. We need the most searching inquiry into all of our supply chains and a policy of protecting ourselves from their vulnerabilities. Trade policy must become the servant of Foreign and Security policy. I see the immigration issue as fairly straightforward: we need more legal skill-based immigration, and less illegal immigration. It's shocking our political class cannot come to this compromise.I might go a step further and disallow immigrants access to our social benefits system for some period of time. This will reduce any misplaced incentives for people to come.Across the spectrum, there are so many win-win compromises that can't be reached because politics is broken. It's a big issue. Really, the private sector would build millions of new housing units along the West Coast if allowed. Much needed.I suspect some sort of federal bonuses for areas that move un-zoned property is needed.  Tried that.  A lot of them caught fire and were burned to the ground with the green left blaming \"global warming\".

Biology Free trade critically relies on the assumption that everyone plays by the rules and no one cheats. That assumption does not hold with China, which cheats and steals at every opportunity. Therefore, we cannot have free trade as long as China--or communist China, at least--is in existence.  And firms in the West do not know this, do not put it into their prices, and are otherwise throwing money away, acting like charities. John, you state: \"But since 2000, that post-war growth rate has fallen almost by half, to 1.4% per year. And it\u2019s worse in Canada and Europe, where many countries have not grown at all since 2010 on a per capita basis.\"The following chart from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' FRED database does not indicate support for your statement (quote above): https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=MDXO .The traces shown in the chart are:Red -- Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure in Constant Prices: Total Gross Domestic Product for Canada/Population, Total for Canada;Green -- Real Gross Domestic Product/Population, Total for United StatesThe abscissa is calendar time spanning from 1962 through 2020 (time increments are annual, end of period).  The ordinate is displayed in percentage change year-to-year.There is no significant difference evident between the growth rates of real GDP/capita of the two national series.  The traces indicate that the correlation between the two countries is strongly positive.  The trend lines in both countries are essentially of the same in magnitude and direction.From this data, the null hypothesis, Ho: there is no difference between the two time series is unlikely to be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, H1: per capita real GDP growth in Canada is worst than per capita real GDP growth in the United States. What is your position on unions in general? Should they be regulated? How? I read your article dated may 12,2020 titled \"How the Fed Plans to Pay the Country's Bills\" and I have a question... at one point you say the banks can by \"flipping an electronic switch. Banks can convert reserves to cash and back at will.\" That's not how I understand fed created reserves(money supposedly created when the FED buys treasuries from a primary dealer.)My understanding is those reserves must remain within the FED system, never to be converted to cash. So, what's the real answer... are banks allowed to convert FED created reserves to cash for the purpose of lending? Reserves held at the Federal Reserve Banks can be exchanged for currency at any time when the Federal Reserve Bank in the commercial bank's city or state is open for business.  The currency so obtained becomes a \"vault reserve\", i.e., a reserve held on the premises of the commercial bank.  Currency can be exchanged for reserves at the FRB in a reverse transaction.  Handling the currency, however, requires physically transporting the currency to/from the FRB from/to the commercial bank's vaults, a costly process usually undertaken for the convenience of the bank's depositors (e.g., individuals and retail businesses that transact in the physical currency). I specified FED created reserves, ie, the FED \"buys\" treasury debt and credits the selling banks reserve account.I believe those reserves must remain in the system to be swapped when the FED returns the treasuries. Hence, no new money is created. Do you want to change your answer? \"So, what's the real answer... are banks allowed to convert FED created reserves to cash for the purpose of lending?\"Sure, by buying back the Treasuries from the Fed and then selling them in the open market (two step process).   Really!!! So the real answer is NO. Reserves remain with the FED system and cannot be converted to cash. Only when reserves are no longer reserves can the bank use that cash to \"print out of thin air\" \"loans.\"There, fixed it for you. Mark,You are forgetting something.  The Fed pays interest on reserves.  Those interest payments can be lent back out.  Principle can't be touched as long as it is held in reserve, interest payments can. Interest was never the question. The statement I objected to was that banks have an electronic switch to turn reserves into cash. Clearly, they do not... only when they are no longer reserves can they serve as basis for \"lending.\" Are you forgetting that those treasuries payed interest??? Are you claiming the FED pays more interest than those banks would receive from the Bonds??? So, NO. No new money is created. Period. No, Mark, I have no intention of changing my comments that appear above.  The description of the process of converting FRB reserves to 'cash' is correct as stated.John Cochrane's remark is famously opaque and I interpret it to be 'throw-away comment' and not one to be accorded any weight whatsoever.In a fractional banking system, the commercial banks regulated by the FRB Board of Governors (delegated) hold reserves in many forms, including but not limited to the banks' accounts with the Federal Reserve Banks around the country.Where does \"new money\" come from?  (1) Commercial bank loans to private borrowers (persons, corporations, municipalities, state and other local governments); and, (2) FOMC quantitative easing (\"QE\") programs.  In case (2) 'base money' is created when the FOMC purchases securities to hold to maturity through the committee's open-market activities.  In case (1) M2 increases.  In case (2) base money increases, which in turn increases M2.  In both cases the money supply increases.  If the FOMC decides to sell its holdings of financial assets, then the base money supply would contract, and M2 would likewise contract.  A commercial bank that holds a balance with the FRB-NY in excess of its calculated reserve requirements needed to clear its liabilities in the payments system, will rid itself of the excess balance by making loans to other banks, brokers, industrials, and non-financial corporations at various terms to maturity.  One might suppose that this is basis of John Cochrane's puzzling remark.  And, I tend to think that that is what he was referring to. Can you be for infinite growth on a finite planet, stereotypical economist and still be taken seriously? We seem to be coming to the end of the fossil fuel splurge but even should \"a miracle occur\"with more energy supply the oceans will boil with a few centuries of compound rate of growth. See the Dothemath.com website. Jim and Linda,First, a lot of economic growth comes from new inventions - black and white TV replaces radio, color TV replaces black and white, motorized vehicle replaces horse and buggy etc.  Growth is only limited by our own imagination.Second, look beyond this planet.  There is a whole universe out there begging to be explored.  Men and women have climbed the highest mountain and explored the deepest oceans on this planet. First, the oceans will never \"boil\" -- surprised some still believe that nonsense. Second, only on \"star trek.\" We will make do with what we have on this planet, and we will do quite well because evolution is still progressing. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

        "description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>The U.S. and NATO must fight</b></p><p>(Coauthored with Elizabeth Fama)</p><p>Why are we \u2014 the U.S., NATO, the civilized western world \u2014 not fighting for Ukraine? If we do not fight in Ukraine now, we will fight there later, or in the Baltics, Poland, or Taiwan, at much greater cost. If we do not forcefully reverse this invasion, larger ones will follow.</p><p>The next few days and weeks are vital. If the government of Ukraine falls, President Zelenskyy and other leaders of the legitimate government will be jailed or murdered. Russia will annex Ukraine, or install a puppet government with a defense treaty. It will declare Ukraine under the Russian nuclear umbrella. Freeing Ukraine after the fact, re-creating a government, will be much harder and riskier.</p><p>Sanctions will not save Ukraine. Sanctions were intended as a deterrent. Sanctions are a punishment. Sanctions are not an effective way to fight a war. They will do little to stop Russia from winning in the next month or two. Sanctions will not achieve what must be our goal: Russian withdrawal, Ukrainian sovereignty, a return to the borders we pledged to uphold in 1994. Cuba, Iran, and North Korea withstood sanctions for decades. So will Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that sanctions have failed to deter Putin, what is the plan? On the current course, if we don\u2019t provide more help, Ukraine loses, the country is destroyed or partitioned, and we settle in for decades of deciding just how much energy Russia sells to Europe, what Europe sells in return, and how much tut-tutting we do about Russia trading with China, Iran, and others. While Putin turns his roving eye to the Baltics.</p><p>To save Ukraine, to save its democratically elected government, to save its people, to stop this from happening over and over, allies must &nbsp;fight.</p><p>We have the means. Russia does not have the power of the old Soviet Union, or of Nazi Germany. Russia spends $62 billion a year on its military. The US spends $788 billion. Germany and France spend $53 each, and the U.K. $59. NATO as a whole spends about $1.2 trillion a year on defense, almost twenty times what Russia spends. Our armies are larger, better equipped, and better trained than Russia\u2019s. We lack only the will.</p><p>News from Ukraine already suggests unexpected Russian weakness: deficiencies in advanced weapons, tactics, training, supplies, and intelligence. There is a good chance that Russia needs this to be over quickly. If this is true, it is all the more important for us to help Ukraine to hold on.</p><p>What can be done in practical terms? NATO can immediately declare a Russian no-fly zone over Ukraine. Denying Russia the skies would critically hamper their invasion. NATO can launch missiles, drones, and airstrikes at Russian army assets. NATO should move invasion forces to the Ukrainian borders. Allies could work closely and directly with the Ukrainian Army, and support their intelligence. The U.S. could unleash our own cyber capabilities. We should protect President Zelenskyy and his government. (The man is a hero.)</p><p>\u2028We cannot fight, many say, because any engagement of NATO and Russian forces could provoke a nuclear escalation. It\u2019s a legitimate worry. Putin is already capitalizing on this fear by placing nuclear forces on alert in response to sanctions. First, Putin knows the retaliation that would follow. Second, our goal is freedom for Ukraine, not invasion of Russia or regime change in Russia. Nuclear weapons exist to defend a country, not to prosecute aggressive wars, and even Putin knows that. That\u2019s why the potential for nuclear war is higher if we try to free Ukraine after Russia has already subsumed it into its sovereign territory. Most of all, if we cannot ever use our conventional military to stop an unprovoked invasion, we surrender now and watch the Century of Invasions unfold.</p><p>We must not fight, others say, in \u201cforever wars\u201d in far-away countries. But in Ukraine we would not be toppling a regime, or \u201cnation-building.\u201d We would be defending and preserving an elected government and its civil society.&nbsp;</p><p>We did this before. In 1990, Saddam Hussein conquered and annexed Kuwait. A coalition of thirty-five nations fought, forced Iraqi troops back to the border, and left. Why did we fight over such a distant piece of land?

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog The U.S. and NATO must fight (Coauthored with Elizabeth Fama) Why are we \u2014 the U.S., NATO, the civilized western world \u2014 not fighting for Ukraine? If we do not fight in Ukraine now, we will fight there later, or in the Baltics, Poland, or Taiwan, at much greater cost. If we do not forcefully reverse this invasion, larger ones will follow. The next few days and weeks are vital. If the government of Ukraine falls, President Zelenskyy and other leaders of the legitimate government will be jailed or murdered. Russia will annex Ukraine, or install a puppet government with a defense treaty. It will declare Ukraine under the Russian nuclear umbrella. Freeing Ukraine after the fact, re-creating a government, will be much harder and riskier. Sanctions will not save Ukraine. Sanctions were intended as a deterrent. Sanctions are a punishment. Sanctions are not an effective way to fight a war. They will do little to stop Russia from winning in the next month or two. Sanctions will not achieve what must be our goal: Russian withdrawal, Ukrainian sovereignty, a return to the borders we pledged to uphold in 1994. Cuba, Iran, and North Korea withstood sanctions for decades. So will Russia.\u00a0 Now that sanctions have failed to deter Putin, what is the plan? On the current course, if we don\u2019t provide more help, Ukraine loses, the country is destroyed or partitioned, and we settle in for decades of deciding just how much energy Russia sells to Europe, what Europe sells in return, and how much tut-tutting we do about Russia trading with China, Iran, and others. While Putin turns his roving eye to the Baltics. To save Ukraine, to save its democratically elected government, to save its people, to stop this from happening over and over, allies must \u00a0fight. We have the means. Russia does not have the power of the old Soviet Union, or of Nazi Germany. Russia spends $62 billion a year on its military. The US spends $788 billion. Germany and France spend $53 each, and the U.K. $59. NATO as a whole spends about $1.2 trillion a year on defense, almost twenty times what Russia spends. Our armies are larger, better equipped, and better trained than Russia\u2019s. We lack only the will. News from Ukraine already suggests unexpected Russian weakness: deficiencies in advanced weapons, tactics, training, supplies, and intelligence. There is a good chance that Russia needs this to be over quickly. If this is true, it is all the more important for us to help Ukraine to hold on. What can be done in practical terms? NATO can immediately declare a Russian no-fly zone over Ukraine. Denying Russia the skies would critically hamper their invasion. NATO can launch missiles, drones, and airstrikes at Russian army assets. NATO should move invasion forces to the Ukrainian borders. Allies could work closely and directly with the Ukrainian Army, and support their intelligence. The U.S. could unleash our own cyber capabilities. We should protect President Zelenskyy and his government. (The man is a hero.) \u2028We cannot fight, many say, because any engagement of NATO and Russian forces could provoke a nuclear escalation. It\u2019s a legitimate worry. Putin is already capitalizing on this fear by placing nuclear forces on alert in response to sanctions. First, Putin knows the retaliation that would follow. Second, our goal is freedom for Ukraine, not invasion of Russia or regime change in Russia. Nuclear weapons exist to defend a country, not to prosecute aggressive wars, and even Putin knows that. That\u2019s why the potential for nuclear war is higher if we try to free Ukraine after Russia has already subsumed it into its sovereign territory. Most of all, if we cannot ever use our conventional military to stop an unprovoked invasion, we surrender now and watch the Century of Invasions unfold. We must not fight, others say, in \u201cforever wars\u201d in far-away countries. But in Ukraine we would not be toppling a regime, or \u201cnation-building.\u201d We would be defending and preserving an elected government and its civil society.\u00a0 We did this before. In 1990, Saddam Hussein conquered and annexed Kuwait. A coalition of thirty-five nations fought, forced Iraqi troops back to the border, and left. Why did we fight over such a distant piece of land? To stop the next invasion. We two are not habitual hawks. We recognize that the history of U.S. foreign interventions has included failures. We know that our military cannot rescue millions of people trapped in misery by despots. But the U.S. and our allies must \u00a0send a message to those despots that we will not return to a world of naked territorial aggression, and that we will fight, if need be, to stop it. **** Update.\u00a0\u00a0Bottom line: We must not let Ukraine lose. Do what it takes, calibrate responses, sure, maybe we don't have the right strategy. Maybe big sanctions will do it. Maybe Putin will be overthrown, But letting \u00a0Ukraine lose and then settling in for a sanctions negotiation is an unacceptable outcome. Do not let Ukraine lose.\u00a0   \"Why are we \u2014 the U.S., NATO, the civilized western world \u2014 not fighting for Ukraine?\"Maybe because one too many politicians (with war dog economists and media in tow) have lied about the pretext for the US going to war - see LBJ and the Gulf of Tonkin incident or how about George W. Bush and his weapons of mass destruction?\"We two are not habitual hawks.\"Weren't you the one asking for a war with China to justify investment in math and science education? I agree.A no-fly zone would require the US/NATO to shoot down Russian planes. Are you (Professor Cochrane) ready for this escalation?Our founding fathers discouraged foreign intervention/entanglements, and John Quincy Adam said we should not go abroad looking for monsters to destroy. We have more than enough problems in the US including a porous border, escalating violent crime, a tattered K-12 educational system, over $30 trillion in debt, and on and on. Plus, as FRestly aptly points out, we have been lied to one too many times (Vietnam, Iraq, COVID, Afghanistan (it was supposed to be a short war that was our longest war and then our exit was tragic) just to name a few).Why not pressure the Biden administration to open up pipelines, leases, permits, and encourage companies to drill for and create energy?If the US government can pay billions for weak/ineffective COVID vaccines, then surely the US can provide incentives for companies to drill for and create energy not only for the US but so the US can reap the windfall from providing energy for Europe, rather than Putin.Under President Trump the US was energy independent, and the US was the largest exporter of energy, so we can do it again and quickly.BTW, why is the US currently importing 20% of our energy from Russia? Stop this madness and windfall for Putin! US and NATO troops could not defeat Afghanistan.How can they defeat Russia? Russia has already demonstrated their incompetence. And there's an enormous difference between defense and invasion.  Could not defeat Afghanistan ... in Afghanistan. That's an argument actually in favor of the ability of defeating Russia in Ukraine John, I've always enjoy your thoughts. What do you think of the \"realist\" position (Mearsheimer's position: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4) and how do you reconcile your thoughts with the tough facts they bring to bear? Before Mearsheimer was a realist, Hans Morgenthau was a realist.  What they both lack is the moral foundation any society must rest upon in order to sustain itself.  That created the undoing of communism in Russia because it got to the point where the people were not invested in their nation to the degree needed to compete with the West.  The same will be true for China \u2013 material wealth will bring demands from the people for more political liberty.  What will a communist political regime do then?  We are not talking about abstract idealism.  What do you think is going on in Ukraine right now?  The same thing that went on in the East Bloc after communism fell. It is not for Russia, or Russians, to determine what Ukraine, or Ukrainians, should want.   If the settlement of the Ukraine situation today were to result in Ukraine becoming neutral militarily but allowed to be democratic and join the EU and \"lean\" West (like Finland, Austria (especially in the '50s), Switzerland) would Putin accept this?I\u2019m reading several news accounts this week, like Mearsheimer's view, of how the U.S. is to blame for Russia/Putin\u2019s action with Ukraine.  They say it started with the U.S. attempt to expand NATO when the Soviet Union collapsed.  Oh really?As I recall almost thirty years ago \u2013 the mid-1990s \u2013 as we were dealing with a newly created Russia and the questioning if NATO was still needed, what shall we do with NATO?  Some of the idealistic talk was that if a new free Russia could liberalize it could join with the rest of Europe economically and a cooperative military arrangement could be made that would work with NATO.This talk was not that all idealistic; it was acted on.  While Russia was not ready to join the European Union (EU) economically, it was invited and did become a participating member of the G-7, making it the G-8 in 1997.  With upgrades to its economy, it could be ready to join the EU.Of the former East Bloc of the Soviet Union, all of those countries started their application to the EU between 1993 and 1996 and got their membership after 2000.  Russia never applied or started an initiative to join the EU. In 1999 the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland became members of NATO \u2013 none of them border on Russia proper; Poland borders on Kaliningrad which is part of Russia but separate from the main territory because it is wedged between Poland and Lithuania.  So no NATO nation was on the Russian border when Putin came to power in August 1999 and became President of Russia in May 2000.  The Baltic States and other nations on Russia\u2019s border joined NATO 2004 and after.My point is this:  Russia, in the mid-1990s, had two paths to follow.  It could liberalize and join Western Europe, or it could remain as it has historically, an East European power.  It choose the later, not the former; and when Putin came to power, he doubled down on this.  Putin had an opportunity to truly revolutionize Russia\u2019s outlook for the future; but choose otherwise.  Germany had a similar opportunity after WWII in the 1950s \u2013 to take its traditional role of a Central European power, counter-balancing its interests East and West; or turn to the West and join in an alliance.  Konrad Adenauer, the leader of West Germany in 1949, choose a new path for Germany\u2019s future.Russia lost its G-8 membership when it invaded the Crimea in 2014.  History has no subjunctive case.  Here we are.  Now what? I largely agree, though we need to be careful not to so unsettle Putin that he greatly expands the war out of desperation to hold onto power.  I do want us to strike now, if we can, as supply lines are stretched and stressed and the Russians are apparently over a barrel. The prospect of watching Russians surrender and/or retreat by the thousands is certainly welcome, as long as we don't push a desperate leader too far.Russia cannot meaningfully compete with the West in the short, or long-run. NATO countries are thugs in a back alley and can only attack weak countries. Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan... These summarize my thoughts as well. It's a grim but inexorable conclusion There's no need for the US to intervene. The balance of power doesn't shift appreciably in Russia's favor if it wins in Ukraine, and it should be clear by now that the blood price will be substantial. As for the next wars, assuming Russia even has the resources to fight them, Poland will offer even stronger resistance and be defended by Germany, Sweden and probably UK naval and air power. We can't let issues in Europe distract us from the main security theater in the Pacific, where the US needs to unite a disparate coalition of lesser powers against a far more powerful potential hegemon. \"You have been given the choice between war and dishonor. You have chosen dishonor, and you will have war!\" - Winston Churchill to the English Parliament, 1938. After the English Parliament's 1938 appeasement in Czechoslovakia.Fascinating how history repeats itself and how short is our memory. \"You have been given the choice between war and dishonor. You have chosen dishonor, and you will have war!\" - Winston Churchill to the English Parliament, 1938. After the English Parliament's 1938 appeasement in Czechoslovakia. Fascinating how history repeats itself and how short our memory is. Xi makes Putin look like Mr. Sissypants. But America's corporate, financial and media elites do business with China.Putin=Hitler, but Xi=Confucianism. There is no money in the U.S. budget for the war. The U.S. state can no longer maintain bridges and roads on its territory.  I must add, I feel uncomfortable supporting war when I am passed the typical age of a soldier and have no children in the service or eligible for service. Sending someone else's kids to die in the name of justified liberty is still hard for me to do. I think one thing worth noting, is that President Putin is not necessarily in the correct state of mind. Thus, in some sense, if NATO chooses to conduct military operations in Ukraine, this may indeed trigger Russian to carry out nuclear missile launches. If one were to assume Putin were rational, this need not be such a concern. However, given the numerous intelligence officers who have stated their position on his state of mind, it may be better to avoid any kind of military involvement in Ukraine, but pledge military involvement if other NATO nations are militarily threatened by Russia. Yes, those who have closely observed an increasingly isolated Putin over the last two years fear that he will not act rationally if his standing is at stake. but what kind of an example would military intervention set for our own corrupt despots? there is a moral hazard here, we cannot let anyone involved in corruption on our side profit from our military actions.  let the good name of the clinton family be as sullied among the corrupt as it is already among the honest. then we can at least know whether we are foaming at the mouths for war because we truly believe in it, or is it just because the \"legitimate\" government of Ukraine has spent a lot on donations to our political leaders...but I dont know...maybe I'm just under the thrall of disinformation...maybe the Clintons and the Bidens and the Bush's are all swell people and only Putin is bad. Hi John Cochrane,Even though I agree that we should be doing more, we are sending special ops veteran volunteers and there are numerous countries sending their own volunteers as well. It might not be enough in your eyes, however, with how disorganized the Russians are (they aren't even following proper military communication standards) and how many of them do NOT actually want to fight nor have proper training/strategy in how to do so effectively......I actually think it's more likely we hold Ukraine than lose it. We still hold every major city and we even have Russians surrendering to turn around and fight alongside Ukrainians against Russians now.Does more still need to be done? Yes. However, there is also a lot that has already been done and continues to be done or at least considered. Cyber warfare is being considered by Biden already and an execution of such a strategy was suggested to him on a bigger scale than ever before. This comment has been removed by the author. A few of ideas:First: The US and the NATO countries have not yet implemented a truly sweeping set of sanctions. They must sanction all imports of oil & gas from Russia. Further, we must seize all properties in New York and London that are owned by Russians of any sort. The same goes for bank accounts and other investments. We need to impose the same sanctions on Russia and Russians as we imposed on Germany and Germans during WWII.Second: The bulk of Russian troops are low skill, very young, conscripts on short terms. https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/why-the-russians-are-struggling/ What would happen if we offered any Russian soldier who surrenders peaceably, \u20ac10,000 in cash, a clean set of civilian clothes, a visa and a work permit for, and a ticket to the NATO country of his choice. I will wager that we would get a surprising number of takers. We might pay an additional bonus to any officer who delivers a whole unit. We could also pay for any arms and ammo they surrender. \u20ac1,000,000 for an MBT would be cheap. Russian MBTs are over $2,500,000 new. Heck, offer \u20ac5,000,000. Still cheaper than blowing them up.Third: There are a lot of \"contractors\" who were employed in Afghanistan and Iraq. They have some very serious skills in the military arts. We could re-up them and subcontract them to the Ukrainian military. they could be in the fight fast.Fourth: Along those lines. How about a squadron of A-10 Warthogs. Lend-lease them to Ukraine. Find \"contractors who know how to fly them. Send them to Ukraine. They can really mess up a formation of armored vehicles.John: These are free to all takers. if you like them please pass them along to H. R. McMaster. He could pass them on to his former colleagues who are still on active duty.  An extension of my idea 2. We could easily justify paying a tank crew that surrenders an intact MBT peaceably, \u20ac1,000,000. The Russian MBTs are priced at \u20ac2,000,000+ new off the lot. Late model used vehicles are being sold at like new prices these days, so we could get our money back.  Professor Cochrane, I agree with you. I have family in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. The city was attacked on the first night by Russian aircraft and on Saturday night by Russian tanks. The tank attack was successfully repulsed. However, I do not know how long the Ukrainian forces can hold out but I pray that they do. I had a Whatsapp message from my cousin in Mykolaiv a few hours ago saying simply \"We will win!\" My uncle is returning to Ukraine from Italy to join the fight. Even though I have family there, it is not the only reason why I support you. I support you because it is ultimately in the best interests of the US to defend democracy. My family in Ukraine is grateful to the US, the UK, the EU, Australia and Japan, and many others, for the assistance so far given but now is the time to do even more.  I agree. Thanks for the interesting piece. Re \"a return to the borders we pledged to uphold in 1994\", I am a bit confused - my reading of the Budapest memorandum (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances#Content) is that the signatories pledged to respect the existing borders, and defend Ukraine in the event of a nuclear attack; but did not commit to defend those borders in the event of an invasion. Can you help me understand if I am missing something? John, You've said exactly what I've been thinking. Especially when I see that 40 mile long traffic jam of Russian tanks and armored vehicles. But in conversations I get no support. Everyone is afraid of being at war with Russia  And you use an \"Anonymous\" name because? Remember the \"Flying Tigers\"?  (American volunteers assisting China when Japan's army invaded).Imagine a rogue group of A10's savaging that 40 mile column. In 2010, the people of Ukraine elected Viktor Yanukovych as President of the Ukraine. In 2014, he was violently ousted from power, leading supporters of that government were killed or imprisoned, and are still imprisoned to this day. Pro-Russia news media and Internet social sites were shut down by the force of the government. Cochrane says the current government is a legitimate, democratically elected government, but arguably that's not true at all. The current government wouldn't be in power if they hadn't recently used violence to kill or imprison their political rivals and crush their news and social media sites.Cochrane is advocating military escalation. That will inflict much more suffering on innocent people. If we shoot down Russian fighter jets, what stops further escalation? Cochrane says that choosing war against Russia now will prevent a future military conflict over Taiwan; will it? It seems entirely plausible that the opposite outcome will happen. A horrible war with Russia might reduce the will in the west to fight an even bigger war with China.Lastly, this isn't an issue of economics. Cochrane is entitled to his opinion, but has no special background or expertise that makes his opinion necessarily better than any other opinion. A good cautionary response. politepete ........ 1.  you should read politico.2.  you should examine the looting done by Yanukovych. Dear John, thanks a lot for your position. I'm from Ukraine, Kyiv School of Economics (VP for economics education). Can i invite you to give a lecture on this in Kyiv (on-line of course) You've lost your mind. It's sad to see. A no fly zone means US is shooting down Russian planes.  You're basically asking to have a nuclear power actively engaging in military conflict with another nuclear power. Seriously. Think about this. The tail risks. What % odds do you put of miscalculation/fog of war/ escalation to general nuclear exchange? 5%? 10%? You should be better than this, and I'm assuming this is heat of the moment, excessive twitter use, social desireability bias madness. But I'd have expected better and think far less of you for this irresponsible post. Couldn't agree more.  A no-fly zone means war with Russia, and yes, a double-digit chance of mushroom clouds in America.And for what?  The Russian conventional military has already proven itself pathetic.  The odds of them rolling on into NATO territory are miniscule at this point.  They know and we know that they would lose if they did. Ukraine will be the farthest west they go, no matter where events go from here. John, thanks for posting this, I could not agree more. Going to war to save Ukraine is a very hard decision, but there are times when hard decisions cannot be avoided, and the logic outlined in your piece is brutally clear. Aggression will not stop until we stop it by force. The risk of nuclear conflict frightens me, but if we signal we are the only ones who fear it, and believe Russia does not, we might as well give them back East Berlin already. Our governments are still debating how much economic discomfort we are willing to bear as we impose sanctions, hoping we can soon go back to business as usual. That ship has sailed. Our way of life is under threat, and if we\u2019re not willing not defend it, then we have already lost it.  John, Elizabeth,I am still just stunned at what has transpired here, and it does remind me of Kuwait, when on the dawning day of the start of US actions in the 1st Gulf War, I found it very depressing to think \"why did it come to this\".  At the time I was on temporary assignment in Japan for Intel and my local Japanese engineers were all excited the morning the US attacks began, while I found it very heavy and depressing that it come to that point.  That said, your OpEd is spot on in that short term situation with the ongoing daily escalating Russian forces, attacks, and sieges of major Ukrainian population centers is very tense, tenuous, and at fulcrum situationally for very different possible futures.  Short term, there is an escalating humanitarian crisis for the Ukrainian population, both in already occupied and under siege population centers across the country.  Any action of the allies risks rapidly escalating events locally, regionally, globally, e.g., even just declaring and enforcing a no fly zone over Ukraine for purposes of airlifting food and humanitarian supplies would be a major risk for much greater escalations.It's a quagmire, with Putin apparently locked into the reactionary position that anything less than a captive Russian state version of Ukraine is an existential threat to the Russian state and people, something he has been moving towards relentlessly for the last 20 years of persistently resenting the breakup of the Soviet Union, and increasing alarm of the western \"allies-i-zation\" of former eastern bloc countries, even to the point he now regrets having supported US leveraging mid Asian states during a mutually interested fight against terrorism after 9/11 in Afghanistan.I have to ask myself, what would other leaders have done here?  Biden and Obama before him certainly project weakness, with any commits of real US forces on the ground always the position of last resort, which doesn't work well in the real world or in the playground in the presence of bullies.Any real escalation by the US and western allies would be simultaneous to persistent diplomatic efforts to get Putin to accept losing the war and allowing a free and independent Ukraine, which is going to be extremely challenging.  You may be right in that the time to act is here, but the risks for larger multi dimensional escalations and with significant long term deleterious effects on many fronts is also real and very challenging ground.Regards, Mike Rodgers What does game theory say here? We have ceded the nuclear leverage to Putin. He controls the playing field in Ukraine. Belarusians, Chechens, mercenaries, may enter. Others no. What then for South Koreans and Taiwan if this is our playbook? Game theory would suggest that if Mr. Putin wants to play Wild West shootout, it's time for the \"Dead or Alive\" posters to be put up:See:https://news.yahoo.com/russian-businessman-places-1m-bounty-231620021.html Will any of your children be fighting the Russians for Ukraine? In 2014, Russian attack to Crimea and Donbass was not punished. True, some cocktail parties were cancelled but otherwise the sanctions were just a substitute for words \u201dnot our problem\u201d. This time Biden promised the same recipe: sanctions but definitely NO more (no force). Putin learned the lesson. And the game continues as long as we rules stay the same.  See:https://news.yahoo.com/russian-businessman-places-1m-bounty-231620021.htmlHas the crowd funding site been set up yet?Will the world's first trillionaire be the guy that takes out Putin? You are assuming that Putin is rational and will not go nuclear. That's a really bad assumption. We need to reserve taking that risk for an attack on a NATO country. It is so tempting to agree. It seems pretty likely that a NATO enforced no fly zone combined with air attacks on Russian forces would have a devasting effect on the invasion. But that means many more Russian dead at the hands of US and NATO forces. Might that not strengthen Putin? The alternative of leaving the fighting to Ukrainians while providing whatever materiel they can effectively use seems superior-- especially when Russian morale is already so low you see Russian some soldiers abandoning equipment and even pre-emptively surrendering. The cost of this approach is move devastation of cities in Ukraine, but this approach still seems like the best approach in the longer run.  First thought is that someone needs to buy John and Elizabeth a couple of plane tickets to Ukraine or the nearest country so they can join the fight, but leave the rest of the world out of it. I am not in favor of risking nuclear holocaust over the Ukrainian dictatorship. It is amazing how the fury of war propaganda can lead otherwise rational individuals to the conclusion that civilizations end is worth risking. While I love the USA, I am not so young as to think US foreign policy isn't belligerent. Must the USA constantly be at war with someone. 20 years in Afghanistan and all the war in between isn't enough? But this time we won't be pushing around little countries, we will be up against a nuclear power. I could go on about the stupidity of NATO expansion; perhaps looking at things from Russia perspective; the years of hating Russia over what turns out to be a hoax. Talk about mass formation psychosis over Russia and Ukraine!  I find it hard to fathom how any remotely rational person could be advocating armed conflict between 2 major nuclear powers: especially with questionable and possibly unpredictable leaders in charge. Some suggest Putin has lost his marbles, while other suggest he is merely sowing confusion as a tactic so people don't guess at his real objectives. He has more room to negotiate for what he really wants if people aren't clear what the objectives are and if they think he may go further than is rational in trying to achieve them.At the same time, many are concerned about Biden's mental acuity. Even if we can hope that he defers to competent specialists and is mostly a figurehead: he is still the one officially in control and if he is truly not fully competent might perhaps be driven polls to \"look presidential\" and \"do something\" and be too aggressive were he to get the US into this.Its unclear why the US should risk any actual involvement. Its unclear if even too harsh economic sanctions might lead an unpredictable Putin to over react and pull Nato countries into this and force the US or even more minor nuclear powers into this.  Great post!Simply put. We should be oppossing Russia in Ukraine, the same way that we know now we should have opposed Nazi Germany invading Poland in 1939.That simple Not that simple.  Do you see any Republicans seeking tax increases to pay for this opposition?https://taxfoundation.org/historical-income-tax-rates-brackets/Tax Rates by year1940 - Bottom 4%, Top 79%1941 (US Enters WWII) - Bottom 10%, Top 81%1942 - Bottom 19%, Top 88%1943 - Bottom 23%, Top 94%1944 - Bottom 23%, Top 94%Instead the federal debt and inflation grows effectively taxing the bottom part of the tax bracket. \"politepete\" is correct. John starts with a wrong postulate, the Ukrainian is democratic, and arrives at a wrong conclusion -- it is worth risking a nuclear war with hundreds of millions dead. Let me add that not only Viktor Yanukovych was ousted, but his agreement with opposition leaders to stop violence and to conduct early elections signed with foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland was broken in couple days. The Minsk agreements were never honored as well. Pro-Russian politician, meaning Ukrainians who are for good relationships with Russia and for mutually beneficial economic ties, were prosecuted and sanctioned (both by the US and by Ukrainian government). Russian language was restricted/banned. High ranked Ukrainian officials openly called Russian people and Russian supporters to be second-class people. This all was in the news (not US news, of course, but it was on BBC news).  John, there is absolutely no problem with voicing your opinion in this blog post. However, for your own benefit, you ought to do some basic research instead of just relaying on American mass media:(1) Check on Wikipedia articles about Ukraine-Russia relationships, 2014 war and 2021-2021 conflict (still on-going, unfortunately), Minsk agreements, etc.  (2) It might be worthy reading about 2003 Iraqi war on Wiki and comparing the two wars (the timelines, events, casualties, etc).(3) An article on Wikipedia about the Peace Treaty of Versailles and its consequences is worth reading.(3) You might also perhaps find and read an English transcript of Putin's speech dated 02/23, in which he declares the war. Even if you do not believe any single word, wouldn't is be worthy for a prudent researcher to know what the enemy thinks?  \"politepete\" is correct.

Pro-Russian politicians, meaning Ukrainians who are for good relationships with Russia and for mutually beneficial economic ties, were prosecuted and sanctioned (both by the US and by the Ukrainian government). Russian language was restricted/banned. High ranked Ukrainian officials called Russian people and Russian supporters names, openly saying they are second-class people. John, there is absolutely no problem with voicing your opinion. However, for your own benefit of a researcher, you ought to do a study instead of relaying on the American media. For example,(1) Please check on Wikipedia articles about Ukraine-Russia relationships, 2014 war and 2021-2021 conflict (still on-going, unfortunately), Minsk agreements, etc.  (2) It might be worthy to read about the 2003 Iraqi war on Wikipedia and compare the two wars (the timelines, events, casualties, etc).(3) An article on Wikipedia about the Peace Treaty of Versailles and its consequences is worth reading (hopefully important history lessens have not been forgotten).(3) Perhaps you might even find and read an English transcript of Putin's speech dated 02/23, in which he declares the war. Even if you do not believe his single word, wouldn't is be worthy for a researcher to know what the enemy thinks?  \"politepete\" is correct. John starts with a wrong postulate, the Ukrainian is democratic, and arrives at a wrong conclusion -- it is worth risking a nuclear war with hundreds of millions dead.

Even if you do not believe his single word, wouldn't is be worthy for a researcher to know what the enemy thinks?  First, I deeply respect your opinions on economic and related issues. I am always recommending or quoting your columns to friends and family. Thank you for helping your readers make sense of confusing economic events and policies, especially via the sources you cite. Second, who with a human heart cannot join you in wishing -- demanding! -- an end to the death and destruction that Putin is visiting on Ukraine? Third, I wish for Ukraine to keep its national autonomy and the people their political self-determination. Given all that, I am wondering about your opinion of the Ukrainian election that installed the government that was subsequently overthrown by coup in 2014. Was that election rigged, and what of elections held after the coup? Putin plays chess; Americans play poker.  I think Biden has played his cards well, and is still holding.  He has been strategically ambiguous, so he has Putin guessing how far to go tit-for-tat up the escalation chain \u2013 a strategy that Obama did not want to play.First, as long as it is land armies in battle, Ukraine should be able to hold out, if not outright defeat the Russians.  The West needs to supply the Ukraine effort and give whatever other support is needed.  It is important that Ukrainians win their battle, and not others win it for them.  They can do this.Second, it is important that the Western Alliance hold together along with the rest of the international community.  Biden has done a good job on this, not going too fast for some reluctant NATO members who are now fully onboard.  Putin really miscalculated on this, as well as a number of American commentators \u2013 Victor Davis Hanson for one, as well as some of your other Hoover \u201cexperts\u201d.And third, when it comes to Putin\u2019s use of air power and missiles, I think at some point the United States especially, along with other NATO members, will have to militarily intervene.Fourth, the sanctions are working.  Because Putin invaded, the U.S. and NATO get to play with all the tools of hybrid warfare; something Obama was too restrained from doing.  There is still a lot more on the table that Biden and the Alliance have not used yet; so it is going to be drip-by-drip for a while.  Get used to it.And finally, strategically it is important for the West to stay out this militarily if it can and let the Ukrainians handle it and hopefully have a good outcome.  Putin has a disrespect for democracies, and thinks authoritarian rule is more stable than \u201cmessy\u201d democratic governance.  A Ukrainian victory, where the West stays out of it and only resorts to sanctions and other hybrid/unconventional tactics, would be a tremendous blow to Putin\u2019s ego.  And you just may get political change in Russia, from within instead of an outside \u201cconqueror\u201d.   Mourir pour Danzig?No, and Putin knows it. Everything  was fine with the West when Ukraine was part of the Soviet empire, and Putin knows it.There will be some kind of demarche to get some kind of mutually acceptable solution. My question is whether a solution might have been agreed upon before the shooting started. I do not know the answer.How about a buffer state?I do not know whether Putin would accept. This war against Russia can be won without the US firing a single shot.  Find a Treasury Secretary willing to kick gold's ass and this war will soon be over.No, anonymous Bitcoin and other digital currencies are not the solution.No, raising interest rates (and associated government interest payments) are not the solution because of the Fisher effect and because of the Ponzi limit.But since we rely solely on war dog economists for policy advice, this is the road we have been led down.  This comment has been removed by the author. A no fly zone would require us to take out air defense systems, many of which are located in Russia.  Therefore, for us to provide the support you are suggesting, we would essentially need to strike the Russian homeland. Yes. No-fly-zone is a term that is great against an opponent you have beaten. This is not the case with the opponent in Ukraine. It's another term for war.We intellectuals are adept at conducting the war of words. I rarely disagree with your brilliant articles. This one is way off. Challenging a nuclear power like Putin with a no-fly-zone or similar is like poking in the eye a angry bear, with theather and tactical end strategic weapons. There is a good chance he will use them.All for what ? For Ukraine ? a semi-failed state hungry for NATO and EU money with deep historical ties to Russia.haven't we had enough of regime change or Democracy building With excellent results in Libya, Iraq, Afgnanistan and Syria.  this was an awful article which reveals serious lack of analytical skills. You are relly advocating the dignificant risk of a nuclear conflict in Europe for a failed and corrupt country like Ukraine, Ukarine that only wants to enter NATO e and the UE to get access to billions of euroes and dollars of free lunches? You must be kidding... Thanks for saying this John, agree completely and appreciate the facts you present If we replaced \"Ukraine\" with \"Vietnam\", what would the main differences be? The US can do more and should. You are so absolutely right.  Other than their nukes, Russia is nothing more than a fading, regional power. Their population is dying off, as is Ukraine's. Their army is struggling to capture positions tens of miles from their borders. Yes, it's horrible what they've done, but it's not worth America going to war. Go take a look at the German order of battle for the invasion of Poland in 1939. Their invasion force was 15 times the size of what Putin is able to muster to attack Ukraine. Ukraine vs Russia is the international equivalent of bum fights. If NATO wants to intervene so bad, let the Poles and the Germans do it.Finally, it's surreal to worry about Ukraine's borders when our own are totally undefended. Every 3 weeks, more illegals invade our country than Russia has troops attacking Ukraine. Disagree completely. Putin has finally learned that he cannot make agreements with the west (U.S.) because the west (U.S.) NEVER abides by such agreements... just ask any native american about that. For eight years he's been trying to get Ukraine to abide by the minsk accords, to no avail. The expansion of NATO is the sole cause of Putin's actions and every death there is the result of the U.S. pushing for ever more NATO encroachment to the borders of Russia. I guess you missed that bit of history, what. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_agreements#Minsk_Protocolhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO I don't know who you are, but thank God you're not in charge. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

What happened in the grandest bailout of all time in the covid crisis, and, more importantly, having done it twice, how are we going to avoid massive bailouts becoming the normal state of affairs? (The first question, of course, is \"how did you miss inflation so drastically and when are you going to do something about it?\")&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>They were offering nearly unlimited cheap debt to keep the wheels of finance turning, and when that didn\u2019t help, the Fed began purchasing massive quantities of government debt outright.</p></blockquote><p>Translation: When dealer banks weren't buying treasury debt fast enough, the Fed lend the banks money to buy the debt, and quickly bought up the massive amount of debt themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fed followed by bailing out money market funds, buying state and local government debt, buying exchange-traded funds that held junk corporate debt, and announcing a do whatever it takes pledge to keep corporate bond prices high. It worked</p><p>It worked. The Fed\u2019s pledges to backstop an array of lending, announced on Monday, March 23, would unleash a torrent of private borrowing based on the mere promise of central bank action\u2014together with a massive assist by Congress, which authorized hundreds of billions of dollars that would cover any losses.</p><blockquote><p>...Carnival Corp. , the world\u2019s largest cruise-line operator. Its business had collapsed as Covid halted cruises world-wide. Within days of the Fed\u2019s announcement, Carnival was able to borrow nearly $6 billion from large institutional investors...If the hardest-hit companies like Carnival, with its fleet of 104 ships docked indefinitely, could raise money in capital markets, who couldn\u2019t?</p></blockquote><p>Let's be clear who is bailed out here: Creditors. People who lent lots of money to shaky businesses, earned nice high yields in good times, now have the Fed and Treasury bail them out in bad times.&nbsp;</p><p>It worked.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Today, nearly two years later, most agree that the Fed\u2019s actions helped to save the economy from going into a pandemic-induced tailspin. </p></blockquote><p>I agree. A crisis was imminent, a toppling of a vastly over-leveraged house of cards was in the works. As \"just in time\" supply chains discovered they needed a bit of extra inventory around, just in time debt financing falls apart at the slightest shock, needing a bit of cash inventory and equity buffer.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The Fed\u2019s initial response in 2020 received mostly high marks\u2014a notable contrast with the populist ire that greeted Wall Street bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis. North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, gave Mr. Powell an \u201cA-plus for 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cOn a one-to-10 scale? It was an 11. He gets the highest, highest marks, and deserves them. The Fed as an institution deserves them.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>I also agree, almost. But &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The question now is what will be the long-term costs and implications of that emergency activism\u2014for the Fed, the financial markets and the wider economy.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>This is the question. Why did the economy get into a&nbsp;situation once again, so soon, that the Fed had to engineer this massive bailout?

Outside this blog and a few other eccentrics, nobody seems to notice or care. We are now firmly in the system of huge leverage, private gain in good times, public guarantee in bad times.

Bailouts reward existing asset owners and creditors at the cost of keeping assets expensive for potential future owners. The American economy seems to thrive on borrowing. Even the creation of new money only occurs when commercial banks lend. The gigantic real estate sector is soaked in debt.Solutions?Make equity dividends tax free? Stimulate macroeconomic growth through money-financed fiscal programs (primarily tax holidays) and not borrowing?I think I agree with the thrust of this column, but you will have to concoct a new method for stimulating macroeconomic growth other than the build up of debt.If I understand matters correctly, there is already a huge amount of \"cash on the sidelines.\" BC,\"Solutions?\"It is a misconception that the Federal Government must borrow under any circumstance.  This misconception is perpetrated by more than 100 years of war dog economists (J. Yellen included), policy makers, politicians, and media cohorts.It is Constitutionally permitted for the US Treasury to sell equity claims against future tax revenue.  Those equity claims should be a public good (as defined by Paul Samuelson) being both non-rivalrous (my claim on future tax revenue does adversely affect the government's financial position) and non-exclusive (equity sold by Treasury is available to any US taxpayer and is sold on demand rather than as a consequence of deficits).  Understand that government bonds are a rivalrous good because of the Ponzi limit.  It is illegal for the U.S. Treasury to pay bondholder interest payments with the sale of new bonds (Ponzi finance).\"I think I agree with the thrust of this column, but you will have to concoct a new method for stimulating macroeconomic growth other than the build up of debt.\"Equity sold by the US Treasury would reduce the federal debt regardless of other spending / taxation programs instituted by the Federal Government.Irving Fisher and a group of economists proposed a similar plan (called the Chicago Plan) calling for equity financed banking and the elimination of the federal reserve as lender of last resort.What I would propose is that since the unified banking system (courtesy of Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Alan Greenspan) refused to convert their outstanding debt into equity shares back during the crisis of 2010-11, the US Treasury should take their place as the seller of equity.Larry Summers and Robert Rubin had the opportunity to institute such a program but instead chose to sell TIPs and inflation indexed bonds instead (modeled after \"Linkers\" in Great Britain).Linkers, TIPs, and other inflation linked securities suffer the same problem that traditional bonds do - they are a rivalrous good in that the returns on them to individual holders are paid from available tax revenue supplied by all tax payers.  During a stagflationary scenario where inflation rises but tax revenue falls, the payments on them can be put at risk.They (TIPs and other inflation indexed bonds) also suffer a political risk in the US.  Because the inflation indexed component on them was not legislated into existence by Congress, a future Congress (seeking to cut federal expenditures) can chose to set the inflation component to whatever they feel like (including negative values) to fund government programs.I have outlined all of this in my Blog including an augmented Taylor rule describing both monetary policy and Treasury policy rules. Ben,\"If I understand matters correctly, there is already a huge amount of cash on the sidelines.\"You understand correctly.  See:https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDDNSThe run up in demand deposits began around 2010.What that should tell you is that capitalism broke around that time and has never been fixed.And so you might ask yourself - stock indexes are near all time highs, why isn't all this money on the sidelines investing in stocks?Two reasons:1.  The 9-11 attack revealed a weakness in the consolidation of equity markets centered in New York City.  A centralized market works great but also puts up a big target for the nefarious.2. See the Ellsberg Paradox - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradox\"It is generally taken to be evidence for ambiguity aversion, in which a person tends to prefer choices with quantifiable risks over those with unknown risks.\"With publicly traded equity stocks there is a level of ambiguity / unknown risk that people may not tolerate - for instance the risk of a bunch of hijackers crippling the markets using airplanes as bombs.With equity sold by the Treasury, the risk is individualized.The best example I can give (as far as government programs) is Social Security.  Social Security benefits are a risk asset in that you may end up paying more in taxes than what you receive in benefits.And yet it is a program that has stood the test of time with bi-partisan support despite being illiquid (I can't sell my accrued benefits to my neighbor). John, this is a dangerous way to think.  Monetary policy is too blunt an instrument to punish a few bad actors without punishing the entire economy.  The Fed must provide us with nominal stability.  That's its job, its whole reason to exist.  The Fed must do this whether or not any particular company or industry shows good character.Kenneth DudaMenlo Park, CA I'm interested to know if you feel a Universal Basic Income is feasible and/or advisable? As at December 2021, some 78.5% of total federal debt is held by the American public, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  It's difficult to see how this proportion of debt held domestically presents a risk of sovereign default.Paul Singer is a speculator in financial markets. This is public knowledge. He would welcome a reduction in the number of competitors he faces daily, wouldn't you say?The Fed's mandate is price stability and full employment.  How would a financial collapse help the Fed achieve either or both of those mandates?  Paul Singer's operations might be spared, but who is Paul Singer to dictate what the Fed will or won't do in a crisis?From 2019Q4 to 2021Q3, in nominal dollars, the federal debt increased by $5.2 trillion, base money increased by $3 trillion, total reserves increased by $2.5 trillion, M2 increased by $5.4 trillion, and, nominal GDP increased by $2.3 trillion (after decreasing by $2.2 trillion by 2020Q2--a turn-around of $5.5 trillion).  Of that $5.2 trillion increase in federal debt during that period, the American public holds $5.1 trillion of it.  A little inflation is a small price to pay.The net effect of that debt increase is a redistribution of asset ownership amongst the American public. In the long-term, the federal debt will be repaid by the cohort of Americans who pay the greater share of federal taxes. That cohort is likely to be the largest holder of federal debt, directly or indirectly, as well. What goes around comes around; as Ing. Vilfredo Pareto, the Italian economist of the Laussane School noted in his population studies. This effect would not have been lost on the economists advising the White House in 2020, or the Fed economists advising the FOMC at the time.Finally, an observation:  Decisions are made on the basis of information known at the time the decision is rendered.  Hindsight is 20:20, it is said.  After the fact, we can say whether a decision was right or wrong, and punish the transgressors through word or deed, as Congressional committees often do.  But, the criticism is often of an academic character and largely unlikely to shed light on what should have been done based on the situation analysis by the decision-makers at the time in the heat of the moment. The legislation that results is, as you point out, and as I pointed out to colleagues in the investment business at the time, in the case of the Dodd-Frank bill, worse than the condition it was intended to cure.  Aside: It continues to astonish this observer that good men and women continue to seek to serve in positions of public trust knowing full well that they will be punished for it whether deserved or not. \"The Fed's mandate is price stability and full employment.\"Actually, the only Fed mandate is price stability.See Humphrey Hawkin's Act of 1979.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey%E2%80%93Hawkins_Full_Employment_Act\"MANDATES the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability.\"Notice - The direction is given to the Federal Reserve board of governors.  This is separate and distinct from the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.Somehow even supposedly well trained economist either don't understand or just ignore the distinction.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governorshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_CommitteeAnd while there is an overlap between the two groups (the 7 board members are also FOMC members), the responsibility for price stability lies with the board.The full employment mandate comes from an older Act of Congress - see:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Act_of_1946Do people read anymore? OEE,\"In the long-term, the federal debt will be repaid by the cohort of Americans who pay the greater share of federal taxes. That cohort is likely to be the largest holder of federal debt, directly or indirectly, as well.\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFRBNThe Federal Reserve banks (as holders of nearly $6 Trillion in government debt) are far and away the largest single cohort.  And so they are going to pay the greatest share of taxes?Well, gosh, why the heck are any of the rest of us paying taxes?  Just have the Federal reserve banks put a bunch of deposits in the US Treasury account and call them \"taxes\". On your 2nd post, FRestly, you have overlooked a salient fact -- the FRBs pay 100% of their net income to the U.S. Treasury.  In effect, the FRBs' marginal tax rate is 100%.On your 1st post, FRestly, you have read the objectives of the Hawkins-Humphrey act of 1978 too narrowly.  Wikipedia (your citation) states:\"In brief, the Act:o   Explicitly states that the federal government will rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve the four goals.o   Instructs the government to take reasonable means to balance the budget.o   Instructs the government to establish a balance of trade, i.e., to avoid trade surpluses or deficits.o  Mandates the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability.o  Instructs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to transmit a Monetary Policy Report to the Congress twice a year outlining its monetary policy.o  Requires the President to set numerical goals for the economy of the next fiscal year in the Economic Report of the President and to suggest policies that will achieve these goals.o  Requires the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to connect the monetary policy with the Presidential economic policy.\"The fourth and the seventh of these seven bulleted requirements ties the actions of the FRB and FOMC to the requirements placed on the government.  The fifth requirement closes the control loop on the FRBs' actions in implementing monetary policy.In other words, fiscal policy and monetary policy are required to act together in harness.  The fourth mandate is:o  Mandates the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability.To maintain long-run growth, a condition of \u2018full employment\u2019 is a requisite, for otherwise monetary policy would be less than optimal as a different monetary policy that gives rise more efficient utilization of the nations resources (including labor) would yield a higher rate of economic growth.  The physical feedback loop is personal consumption expenditures -- the unemployed consume less while placing a greater burden on government for social support and spending, ergo higher social transfers which reduce resources for productive economic growth (i.e., higher levels of taxation or government borrowing to fund transfers to the unemployed).  Fiscal and monetary policies that achieve productive \u2018full employment\u2019 increase social welfare and reduce the tax burden on productive sectors of the economy, thereby reducing the \u2018dead hand\u2019 of government.  Full employment in this sense is an implicit objective of the 1978 Act.  And, it is in this sense, that the twin mandates are understood, a.s. OEE,The problem is when government ignores it's own requirements:1.  Explicitly states that the federal government will rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve the four goals.2.  Instructs the government to take reasonable means to balance the budget.3.  Instructs the government to establish a balance of trade, i.e., to avoid trade surpluses or deficits.My point is that relying JUST on the central bank to accomplish all of these goals makes all of them difficult to achieve - which is why I isolated the explicit directions given to the Fed Board of Governors.With price stability responsibility given to the central bank, the responsibility for the rest falls upon government.If instead we want to rely solely on the central bank to achieve ALL of the goals, then it (the central bank) must get into the business of credit allocation deciding which business investments will lead to lower inflation, reduction in trade balance, reduction in federal budget deficits, etc.If we are going to rely solely on the central bank to achieve all of these goals, then we should grant them the tools to achieve them including:1.  Rejecting private loans to companies / individuals that offshore their tax liability or simply dodge any tax liability.2.  Rejecting private loans to companies / individuals that speculate on the price of commodities and other raw / intermediate goods.3. Rejecting loans to the federal government itself and any bank / business that purchases bonds issued by the federal government. OEE,\"On your 2nd post, FRestly, you have overlooked a salient fact -- the FRBs pay 100% of their net income to the U.S. Treasury. In effect, the FRBs' marginal tax rate is 100%.\"No, I didn't overlook that the FOMC can CHOOSE to either pay the interest payments that they receive from the federal government to banks as interest on reserves or they can CHOOSE to return the interest payments to the Treasury.  There is no legal mandate that the FOMC must return interest payments back to the Treasury.  The FOMC's marginal tax rate is whatever they want it to be.\"To maintain long-run growth, a condition of full employment is a requisite, for otherwise monetary policy would be less than optimal as a different monetary policy that gives rise more efficient utilization of the nations resources (including labor) would yield a higher rate of economic growth.\"The point of my post was this - relying SOLELY on the central bank to achieve multiple economic objectives (for instance balance of trade and budget) is a recipe for trouble.In the somewhat hypothetical, if the federal government set the age at which you begin receiving retirement benefits at age 45 instead of 65, how close do you think you would get to full employment REGARDLESS of what the central bank does?If you are going to rely SOLELY on the central bank to achieve multiple economic goals, then the ONLY way that happens is for the central bank to pick and chose which loans will result in higher employment, lower trade deficit, etc. - aka, credit allocation. Do you have evidence that the federal government is not relying primarily on the private sector to achieve the four goals?I stress again that you are interpreting the language of the Acts too narrowly.  You have emphasized that the government is \"- relying SOLELY\" on the FRB \"...to achieve multiple economic objectives (for instance balance of trade and budget)... .\"  How do you arrive at that conclusion?Then, \"... if the federal government set the age at which you begin receiving retirement benefits at age 45 instead of 65, how close do you think you would get to full employment REGARDLESS of what the central bank does?\"  The real world example that fits your hypothetical scenario is Malaysia in the 1990s.  The retirement age was set at 55 years of age, and it didn't  negatively affect \"full employment\".  Indeed, the government's policy was intended to promote full employment by forcing older workers out of the workforce when they reached the official mandatory retirement age, thereby opening positions to younger workers at a time when the Malaysian demographic statistics were highly skewed to the young.  But that is government policy working through the private sector, not the central bank.The concept of full employment does not imply that there will be no unemployment.  In any event the term \"full employment\" does not appear in the 1946 Act or 1978 Act. \"Full employment\" is just a short-hand way of describing the neutral rate of unemployment -- i.e., the level of unemployment at which the price level neither increases nor decreases, ceteris paribus.  You will recognize this as the \"Phillips Curve\" effect.  The parallel concept is the 'neutral rate of interest' which is that rate of interest that neither accelerates economic growth and thereby lifting the rate of inflation, nor decelerates it giving rise to deflation.  This is a Wicksellian concept, though the term Wicksell used was \"the natural rate of interest\" and it applied to the private sectors' cost of capital--if the bank rate exceeded the natural rate of interest, recession resulted, but if the bank rate was below the natural rate of interest, economic expansion resulted.  At the natural rate of interest, growth was steady and the private sector earned its cost of capital.  The concept of inflation was worked into this conceptual model, and employment followed the normal course--rising during economic expansion and falling during recessions.The trade balance depends on private sector competitiveness and government policy (excl. of the central bank, though the bank rate has an impact on the rate of foreign exchange which affects the balance of trade to a degree).  A country whose currency serves as the World's reserve currency will inevitably run a trade deficit.  Discontinue the USD as the World's reserve currency if you would rather run a trade surplus.Your last point is germane. Since the central bank does not engage in credit allocation decisions in normal economic situations (financial crises being excepted as being non-normal situations), we can infer, on the basis of this criterion, that the FRB is not being relied upon solely as the agent for the government to attain \"the four goals\".I now punt the ball back into your court. OEE,\"Do you have evidence that the federal government is not relying primarily on the private sector to achieve the four goals?\"Government stimulus checks?Have you had your head stuck in the mud all of this time?\"The retirement age was set at 55 years of age, and it didn't negatively affect full employment. Indeed, the government's policy was intended to promote full employment by forcing older workers out of the workforce when they reached the official mandatory retirement age.\"If we are going to arbitrarily define full employment as basically whatever age the federal government thinks is appropriate, then why not 22 years old? Problem solved!!!  Anyone over the age of 22 that is not working is considered retired.\"Your last point is germane. Since the central bank does not engage in credit allocation decisions in normal economic situations (financial crises being excepted as being non-normal situations)...\"Not really.  See John's statement above:\"This is absolutely wrong.  (Bold and italic, I'm shouting from the rooftops.) The moral hazard is TOO MUCH DEBT, both issued and bought....The source of the shock is irrelevant.\"When you understand that a government Treasury can sell equity in lieu of debt / bonds, then everything else falls into place including:1.  Increasing the natural rate of interest / real economic growth rate2.  Reducing trade deficits3.  Increasing employment4.  Restoring central bank independence focused on price stability.\"A country whose currency serves as the World's reserve currency will inevitably run a trade deficit.\"Nope, incorrect.  The dollar has been the world's reserve currency since the Bretton Woods agreement.  It wasn't until the Nixon shock and later Reaganomics that we developed persistent trade deficits.I have explained this to you more times than I can count. FRestly, a response to your reply:\u25cf \"Government stimulus checks?\" -- I would say that the transfer payments made in 2020 and 2021 are not evidence that the government is not relying on the private sector to achieve the four goals.\u25cf \"Have you had your head stuck in the mud all of this time?\" Your remark is intemperate, and not worthy of your abilities, nor is it conducive to a rational discussion of events and measures taken by the government and private sector in this forum. Save it for the bar room.\u25cf \"If we are going to arbitrarily define full employment as basically whatever age the federal government thinks is appropriate, then why not 22 years old? Problem solved!!! Anyone over the age of 22 that is not working is considered retired.\"  If you say so.  The example of Malaysia was presented in response to your earlier remark, and not a recommendation for the USA which has the opposite problem--i.e., a population demographic which is increasingly weighted towards the elderly and an insufficient proportion of younger working age adults.\u25cf \"Not really. See John's statement above:  \"This is absolutely wrong. (Bold  ... .\"\"  John Cochrane's statement pertains to \"moral hazard\", i.e., the negative externality imposed upon society by private sector actors who rely on limited liability to avoid shouldering the consequences of their actions when the market moves against their leveraged positions and the Federal Reserve and the federal government are forced to step in to stop runs on the financial intermediaries that result from those actors' behavior. He is speaking from the perspective of a general tax payer whose future income and wealth will be burdened by government taxes and/or inflation arising from the government's and/or the Federal Reserve's support to the markets.  His remark does not speak to credit allocation by the Federal Reserve System, per se.\u25cf \"When you understand that a government Treasury can sell equity in lieu of debt / bonds, then everything else falls into place\" This is your conception of a security that the U.S. Treasury could, theoretically speaking, utilize.  For its effectiveness, it relies on the private sector to take up the hypothetical securities, as we've discussed previously.  It is not a security that the Treasury has issued up to the present time.\u25cf \"Nope, incorrect. The dollar has been the world's reserve currency since the Bretton Woods agreement.\"  The USD was not the world's reserve currency at the time of the Bretton Woods agreement (July 1944).  The Bretton Woods arrangement became functional in 1958.  The agreement pegged the value of the USD to gold at $35/troy oz.  A currency peg to gold has straight-forward dynamics that require the country pegging to gold to maintain a positive or neutral trade balance.  If that country runs a trade deficit, then it must either close the trade deficit and run a trade surplus or it must raise its interest rates to attract gold to it, or lose its gold reserves.  The agreement collapsed because the US wasn't prepared to discipline itself to maintain the peg.  France which was running a trade surplus with the US at the time demanded gold in exchange for dollars; Nixon then broke the peg because the US had printed more dollars than there was gold in Fort Knox to back those dollars.  It took until 1971 for the system to break.  Nothing happens overnight.\u25cf \"I have explained this to you more times than I can count.\"  Scolding now? OEE,\"Government stimulus checks? -- I would say that the transfer payments made in 2020 and 2021 are not evidence that the government is not relying on the private sector to achieve the four goals.\"What in your mind would be evidence?\"...and the Federal Reserve and the federal government are forced to step in to stop runs on the financial intermediaries that result from those actors' behavior.\"No one \"forced\" Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, etc. to convert bank debt to Treasury debt - who are you trying to kid here?  Paulson could have told his investment banking friends to convert their debt liabilities to equity shares (the Chicago Plan) OR he could have begun selling equity shares out of the Treasury and using the funds to pay off banking debt.I have explained this to you more times than I can count. - Scolding now?Pretty much.  It took seemingly forever to get you to engage in a discussion of government equity, which I do appreciate when you finally came around.  So sometimes I get exasperated.\"This is your conception of a security that the U.S. Treasury could, theoretically speaking, utilize. For its effectiveness, it relies on the private sector to take up the hypothetical securities, as we've discussed previously. It is not a security that the Treasury has issued up to the present time.\"Because?  I mean really I don't get it.  Has this country been at war for so long that the fields of economics and public policy have become entirely enshrouded in the fog of war? The Chicago Plan was proposed in 1933 by Irving Fisher, et al., and answered in 1935 in the negative.  It was resurrected in 1939, and then shelved.  It was again resurrected in 2012, with modifications in a working paper published by the IMF, but never gained traction.  In 2019, Christine Lagarde dismissed it, saying that she was not convinced \"that eliminating the role of private banks in the supply of \u2018broad\u2019 money is a good idea\".  [Wikipedia: Chicago Plan] John Cochrane, in this blog space, has promoted \"narrow banking\" (essentially, The Chicago Plan of Irving Fisher, et al.) while noting that the FRB has rejected every application for 'Narrow Banks'.  Your \"Government Equity\" concept is hypothetical in nature.  It requires a taxpayer who is willing to purchase forward contracts from the IRS, i.e., pay cash money, to pre-pay a future uncertain tax liability some n years ahead of the liability's due date.  It is not the Chicago Plan.  It would not raise money in any situation like that which occurred in late 2008 and 2009.  The players then were not regulated commercial deposit taking banks, but were unregulated or self-regulated 'investment banks', and hedge funds and insurance companies.  Contrary to your assertion, the two alternatives facing Paulson and Bernanke at that instant were (1) to provide unlimited access to federal funds (Treasury or FRB) or (2) allow the U.S. financial system to work it out for themselves without federal assistance at the risk of significant damage to the U.S. financial system collectively and to the reputation of U.S. government.  Hindsight is 20:20 and you are applying that normative standard here in your remarks.What I stated viz. \"Government Equity\" (\"GE\") was (a) I'm not a buyer, and (b) you haven't had any success in convincing the Sec. of the Treasury or the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank System to buy into it and present it to Congress for approval.  I pointed out the inherent risks that GE (as first described by you in this blog space) presented to a potential purchaser and why I thought that it would not be an attractive proposition to a business owner.  I haven't troubled to follow up on your latest variation on GE, so you may consider my views to be 'out of date'.  Be that as it may be, there is no likelihood that GE will be adopted by the Treasury anytime soon, in my humble opinion.As to the Chicago Plan, forcing commercial banks to reduce their loans outstanding to the level of their book equity plus deposits--i.e., eliminating fractional banking in the U.S.--would lead to an economic depression presaged by widespread bankruptcies and considerable population dislocations.  John Cochrane's support for \"Narrow Banks\" (no fractional banking) is limited specifically to bank charters for new banks (essentially 'savings and loan' companies, or 'trust companies') that can only lend up to 100% of their reserves held in the Federal Reserve Bank System or as vault reserves (cash, bullion and species).  The point of these new 'Narrow Banks' is to access the FRB's federal funds rate or interest on excess reserves (\"IOERs\"), and not as sources of new loans although that is not necessarily precluded. 'Narrow Banks' would not be able to compete against the regulated fractional-banking system banks for loans and deposits (which come with those loans and other services).As to the question, \"What in your mind would be evidence?\", my reply is that I am not the one challenging the status quo--it is up to the challenger of the status quo to prove the validity of his thesis, or give it up. Seems to me the Fed needs better tools, if they can be engineered. You know the saying - if you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail: pandemics, wars, climate threats, natural disasters. But maybe liquidity is the best hammer/tool in the toolbox. I've often wondered if 5/5/5 is an economic sweet spot: 5% UNRATE, 5% FFF, and NAIRU = 5%.  It worked pretty well through the 1990's until a bunch of economists thought it was a good idea to fund a bunch of investment bank bailouts and never-ending wars on the cheap.https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF Powell's job was to control the money stock so as to control inflation.  But Powell continues to buy bonds, he removed Reg. D restrictions on savings' withdrawals, and he eliminated reserve requirements.  Powell hasn't reversed anything he unleased and inflation is at 40-year highs. The truth is probably closer to, if the fertilizer had been allowed to hit the fan, the economy would briefly have tanked. Pols and voters would have seen that the price of COVID panic was too high and gone back to business as usual. By now the US economy would be back on course with the reversal showing as only a brief dip in the rearview mirror. The doubtless well-meant rescue measures have only succeeded in multiplying the misery, and extending its timescale for  decades to come. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog Just as I hit publish on my last post, the Wall Street Journal publishes a much better essay\u00a0by Ted Nordhaus\u00a0on the impossibility of building infrastructure in the US, even if it is green alternative energy climate-change infrastructure. In Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert, local environmentalists and devotees of the Burning Man festival are using the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to oppose a geothermal energy plant. Further south, the Sierra Club has joined with all-terrain vehicle enthusiasts to stop development of what would be the nation\u2019s largest solar farm, which it says threatens endangered tortoises. ... proposals to develop wind energy in American coastal regions have also faced a constant barrage of NEPA and Endangered Species Act (ESA) lawsuits designed to stop them. The Nantucket wind farms are the classic example. Wind farms, yes, but not if it spoils the view of uber-wealthy greens. Sue! On whale-disturbance grounds.\u00a0  ...In California, environmentalists have used a state law designed to protect fish eggs as a pretext to close the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, the state\u2019s largest source of clean energy, while the California Environmental Quality Act has hobbled efforts to build both high-speed rail and high-voltage transmission lines that the state is counting on to meet its climate commitments. \u00a0..over the last decade, the U.S. hasn\u2019t constructed a single major new transmission line. High speed rail, billions over budget, the prize of the 2009 shovel-ready stimulus programs, has not laid a single mile of track. It will probably be ready at gold-plated cost, just as the last car and truck on I-5 is electric.\u00a0 Electrification is big news. But the electricity has to come from somewhere, over power lines that have to be built. Where I live they just banned gas hookups. For now, we burn gas to make electricity, then send it over nonexistent power lines to turn the electricity into heat, at about half the efficiency of just burning it at home. I guess the idea is that after we've burned about twice as much gas as we need for a decade, eventually it will all come from those new solar panels that work at night.\u00a0 (In related news, in New Jersey's similar plan to switch from gas to electricity which comes, for now, from gas,\u00a0 The Department of Environmental Protection, which is mulling new regulations for boiler permits, said in a rule proposal unveiled in December that electric boilers would cost between 4.2% and 4.9% more to operate than their gas counterparts. But a correction issued by the agency Tuesday said running electric boilers would cost between 4.2 and 4.9 times more than their fossil fuel equivalents. Whoops!)\u00a0 Nuclear power remains a catastrophe:\u00a0 In Washington, D.C., meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission peremptorily rejected last month the application of the first advanced nuclear reactor developer to seek a license before the commission, to cheers from leading environmental groups....\u00a0 ...Merely completing an environmental-impact statement for infrastructure projects now takes almost five years on average.\u00a0 The US is still capable of dumping trillions of dollars down ratholes, Though the Biden administration and Democrats currently propose to spend close to a trillion dollars on low-carbon infrastructure and technology, there is little reason to believe the U.S. is capable of building any of it in a timely or cost-effective way.

And a special nod to California\u00a0 Federal taxpayers should not send billions of dollars to the states every year without a reasonable expectation that the funded infrastructure will be built in a timely and cost-effective way. The Government trying to promote the construction of infrastructure using taxpayer money while government enhanced regulation (by the same \"Government\") prevents the construction of this very same infrastructure is a \"beautiful\" case of public choice theory: in reality governments don't work like their favorite narratives could make you believe they do.In any case this is far from being an exceptionality of the US. In Germany I can't wait to see how the battle between climate activist and conservationist over wind turbines unfold.Once you enter the realm of the \"political market\" any costly stupidity can happens (a risk that it is only mitigated by the fact that, most of the times, nothing happens given the \"veto power\" of so many constituencies in this political market)https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/17/germanys-plans-for-wind-power-are-dauntingly-ambitious Enjoying the coverage of these energy snafus! The root of the opposition to energy / infrastructure at large is an anti-human philosophy, that views human action or impact as being evil as such. Notice how there is ALWAYS a reason for opposition: whether the trees, the butterflies, the bats, the sturgeon - all take priority over human existence and what human existence requires.  \"For now, we burn gas to make electricity, then send it over nonexistent power lines to turn the electricity into heat, at about half the efficiency of just burning it at home.\"Heat pumps are a thing FYI. It's usually more efficient to burn gas in a turbine to make electricity to power a heat pump, than burning it in a boiler. And that was if all the electricity were gas, which it obviously wouldn't be. This comment has been removed by the author. This comment has been removed by the author. At this point in time, the \"status quo\" is ALWAYS the best option. New regulation or any regulatory change would be counterproductive. It has been like that for a long time now.From Reason interviewing Coase:Reason: Can you give us an example of what you consider to be a good regulation and then an example of what you consider to be a not-so-good regulation?Coase: This is a very interesting question because one can\u2019t give an answer to it. When I was editor of The Journal of Law and Economics, we published a whole series of studies of regulation and its effects. Almost all the studies\u2013perhaps all the studies\u2013suggested that the results of regulation had been bad, that the prices were higher, that the product was worse adapted to the needs of consumers, than it otherwise would have been. I was not willing to accept the view that all regulation was bound to produce these results. Therefore, what was my explanation for the results we had? I argued that the most probable explanation was that the government now operates on such a massive scale that it had reached the stage of what economists call negative marginal returns. Anything additional it does, it messes up.The whole interviewhttps://reason.com/1997/01/01/looking-for-results/ Just pray fusion works.

Thanks! Can't they sell this power in Canada? Isn't the economic driving force, the fact that Americans will pay more for the electricity? I suppose some bureaucrat will get a warm feeling as NY moves closer to their 70% goal, but from the standpoint of carbon emissions, this project is nonsense, because of transmission losses. Couple of potential reasons. IIRC they have a surplus. They want to expand one way or another. New York City is a metropolis that's relatively close to Qu\u00e9bec. Aside from the red tape, the national political border doesn't make it further away physically. NYC may be willing to pay more or pay it sooner than the other nearby places the power provider could export to. Someone can correct me if I'm off-base here, but would replacing NYC's current 'less-than-green' power sources with surplus from a hydropower plant still be nonsense from a carbon emissions standpoint, even with transmission losses? I live in a country with almost all rivers blocked with dams. And we have no migratory fishes anymore. It is a bad trade off, I'd take nuclear over that any day.  The legal and regulatory Gordian Knot that binds down those who would provide new and expanded infrastructure -- especially for power, water, and transportation -- will have to be dealt with in the same way that Alexander dispatched the legendary original one, except with us voters in the role of Alexander, I think. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog What rights do we need to guarantee our political freedom. Well, the right to speak freely, of course. The right peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Even in trucks.\u00a0 But without economic freedom you cannot have political freedom. The right to work, which requires the right to hire. If the government, or political pressure groups, can stop you from being hired, you cannot speak, you cannot assemble, you cannot act politically. Communist countries didn't need to put people in jail. They could just stop them from working.\u00a0 And the right to transact, freely and anonymously. If the government can monitor your transactions, freeze your assets, \"sanction\" you, or freeze your ability to transact, to buy or sell anything, it can quickly silence you, stop your political participation, undermine political movements or even aspiring individual politicians.\u00a0 This is playing out in Canada right now. I have stated the principle before, but now we have a good example before us of just what the danger is. I don't care how you feel about the truckers, but look at the power the government has used to silence their political protest. The government can use the same power to silence individuals. Or protests from the left.\u00a0 Reports that there are bank runs and outages as Canadians try to quickly take money out of banks are an interesting consequence.\u00a0 This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto. If we have arbitrary, cheap, completely anonymous transactions, tax evasion, theft (ransomware), fraud, can go haywire. If we have complete surveillance and control, political \u00a0liberty goes out the window.\u00a0 Just found your blog. Interesting reading & great to hear you. Here's how the priorities should work:1. Human rights (right to body)2. Contract rights (right to collaborate)3. Property rights4. Political rights (ability to affect policy toward others)These are implicitly commandments 6-9. You don't have effective property rights unless theft is prosecuted, contract rights unless violation is prohibited, or human rights unless murder is prosecuted. Similarly, if abuse of the political system is permitted, the political system loses its legitimacy and we effectively lose political rights too.  Excellent synopsis. Thx. Especially grounding our rights in Scripture. Rational governance is Supra-rationally grounded in the ineffable.  Hobbes, like Machiavelli before him, promoted the idea that monitoring really does matter. And, like North, institutions restrict an option set, not by virtue of the probability of being caught, but the certainty of it. The US government shut down railroads strikes in the late 1800's because rail cars were being used to transport US Mail. So there's a precedent in the US for shutting down protests that interfere with government business and general commerce. I'm not sure what the equilibrium will be with digital commerce when it comes to enforcement. With fintech, all transactions can be harvested and flagged based on who writes the algorithms and for what purpose. This makes the MC of fighting corruption potentially very low, but with unknown externalities. \"Weapons of Math Destruction\" by Cathy O'Neil does a great job of exposing how algorithms can be used to punish and restrict economic activity and opportunity. Regarding crypto - I believe the Treasury dept has been laying down some regulations for transactions on Crypto Exchanges as a means to monitor wealth creation. How it could be used to monitor potential criminal activity is another matter. Converting crypto to whatever fiat currency still requires some work, but the lineage of transactions being anonymous presents issues. Surveillance capitalism isn't just on the social media side: it'll find its way into transactions, too. Already recommender engines use transaction logs to suggest more stuff to buy. Can build a preference model of that data, along with search. \"You can run, but you cannot hide.\" John,\"This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto. If we have arbitrary, cheap, completely anonymous transactions, tax evasion, theft (ransomware), fraud, can go haywire. If we have complete surveillance and control, political  liberty goes out the window.\"It's not really that hard a question to answer.  The answer is that you must migrate away from your thinking about transactions in terms of two parties and move toward three party transactions.  That third party can be government but does not need to be.In a two party transaction it takes the mutual consent of both parties for the transaction to take place.P1 - No, P2 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes - Transaction happensIn one of four (25%) cases, the transaction takes place.Contrast that with three party transactions:P1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensIn 4 of 8 cases (50%), the transaction happens.Markets are INEFFICIENT because they rely predominantly on two party transactions.Samuelson and Fama are incorrect. No-one is going to want to participate in a system where any two parties can conspire to force a transaction on an unwilling third party, which your example implies.If all three parties have to agree, then the transaction occurs in only 1 in 8 cases (12.5%). But, that's irrelevant: the probabilities of the 8 cases are not equal; they depend on expectations of value creation. Anonymous,\"But, that's irrelevant: the probabilities of the 8 cases are not equal; they depend on expectations of value creation.\"The probabilities on the 4 cases in a two party transaction are not equal either; they also depend on expectations of value creation.The point of the exercise was to do an apples to apples comparison of two party and three party transactions.\"No-one is going to want to participate in a system where any two parties can conspire to force a transaction on an unwilling third party, which your example implies.\"Do you live in a cave or on some deserted island?See prosecutor (party #1), jury (party #2), and defendant (party #3) in any criminal proceeding.Or see taxation for that matter.  Can two parties (elected representatives and other voters) conspire to force me to pay taxes?  They most certainly can.  I will have a vote in the matter, but as with my three party example, I may get outvoted. John,\"This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto.

FRestly, check your logic.  In the two-party transaction example, in 1 of 4 combinations, 25%, a 2-way transaction occurs.  In the three-party transaction example, in 1 of 8 combinations, 12.5%, a 3-way transaction occurs.  The conclusions expressed in the penultimate and the ultimate sentences bear no relation to the examples given. OEE,Check your reading comprehension skills.In the three party transaction, I am relying on majority rule (2 votes out of 3) for the transaction to take place the same way that I am relying on majority rule in a two party transaction (2 votes out of 2).  With three party transactions, that occurs in 50% of possible voting outcomes.The point is that there is a trade off between economic efficiency and economic freedom as illustrated by the example above.Two party transactions provide the most individual freedom but are the least economically efficient.Three party transactions sacrifice some economic freedom (you may vote no on a trade, but be outvoted) but are more economically efficient.Robert Mundell (your fellow Canadian) made a similar observation regarding currency exchanges here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_problem FRestly,My remarks referred to your statement:\"It's not really that hard a question to answer. The answer is that you must migrate away from your thinking about transactions in terms of two parties and move toward three party transactions. That third party can be government but does not need to be.\"\u201c\u2026transactions in terms of two parties\u2026\u201d  are bi-lateral transactions, in the meaning of that term as it is used in the Wikipedia page cited.\u201c\u2026move toward three party transactions\u2026\u201d are tri-lateral transactions, in the meaning of that term as it is used in the Wikipedia page cited.Your examples all refer to bi-lateral arrangements (\"transactions in terms of two parties\").  If you are relying on bi-lateral arrangements to make your point in criticism of John Cochrane\u2019s remarks, then my observation serves to point out that you have, in your enumerated examples, ignored \u201cthree party transactions\u201d, i.e., A-B-C (tri-lateral) vs. A-B (bi-lateral).The Wikipedia page refers to currency trading pairs (bi-lateral) but notes that Mundell\u2019s observation does not hold for currency trading triples (tri-lateral).I trust that this explanation will serve to clear up any misapprehension. OEE,\"Your examples all refer to bi-lateral arrangements (transactions in terms of two parties)\"Again, check your reading comprehension skills.From above:P1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 = Party #1P2 = Party #2P3 = Party #3In 4 of 8 cases (50%) IN THE THREE PARTY VOTING ARRANGEMENT, the transaction happens. Using the above:For two party transactions - 25% of potential trades take placeFor three party transactions - 50% of potential trades take placeIn an n good barter economy:For two party transactions there are n*(n-1)/2 combinations of two goods that can be tradedFor instance with goods A, B, C, and D there are the following combinations:AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD : Total of 6 combinationsFor three party transactions there are n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6 combinations of three goods that can be traded.For instance with goods A, B, C, and D there are the following combinations:ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD : Total of 4 combinationsIf we allow all possible trades to be voted on, then in a barter economy with two party transactions the average quantity of lots of goods that will be traded can be calculated as follows:2 * n*(n-1)/2 * 25% = n*(n-1)/4In a four good barter economy with two party transactions an average of 4*3/4 = 3 lots of goods will be traded.If we allow all possible trades to be voted on, then in a barter economy with three party transactions the average quantity of lots of goods that will be traded can be calculated as follows:3 * n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6 * 50% = n*(n-1)*(n-2)/4In a four good barter economy with three party transactions an average of 4*3*2/4 = 6 lots of goods will be traded.It should be obvious that n*(n-1)*(n-2)/4 is always greater than n*(n-1)/4. John, blocking bridges with trucks is not speech.  Is the Canadian government trying to silence people, or are they trying to protect people's freedom to transact from disruptive behavior?Hopefully, if the executive branch abuses its power and silences protected speech, the judiciary will step in.  If the Trump era has taught me anything, it's the importance of an independent judiciary, a key protection for political liberty in a world where the government has complete surveillance and control of electronic transactions and everything else.Kenneth DudaMenlo Park, CA Canada is a different kettle of fish.  I don' think they really have an independent judiciary.  Here in teh US most judges are stooges of the Democrat-Progressives.  Earl Warren's SCOTUS showed us that judges are mere autocratic bureaucrats in black robes, effectively a second unelected legislature relying on sentimental fools to stay in power.  The current judicial \"system\" in the US reminds me of the last days of the Parlements of France under the Ancient Law of France--which got abolished during the Revolution and replaced with the Code Napoleon.  The Restored Bourbons in 1815 kept the Code Napoleon and the revised courts; the old Parlements were premanently gone.  Read \"The Black Count\" to get some feel in passing what the Ancient Law of France was like in practice--one of its Maxims was \"There are no slaves in France\".  The First Republic for a few months even tried to make slavery legal in Revolutionary France! Superb comment, John. Those of us who warned about \"soft totalitarianism\" on the campuses of the 1990's are seeing our fears realized. It is important to note the \"finer points\" of the strategy employed by Mr. Trudeau. His minister is threatening to freeze bank accounts of those connected with the trucker protest, but the minister refuses to specify how many accounts, or what criteria would be employed. Moreover, one article stated that lists would be turned over to banks, and it would be the banks' responsibility to determine who would be frozen. This allows Mr. Trudeau to evade responsibility, while terrorizing anyone who might disagree with him. Cost-conscious bank executives might decide to simply cancel the accounts of anyone on the list. Mr. Trudeau missed a golden opportunity to bring Canadians together by (a) meeting openly with the truckers, and (b) finding a compromise solution. Anyone marginally more competent than our current U.S. President could have done this easily. This comment has been removed by the author. This is the first I've heard of runs on banks, which I thought would be all over the place after the government promised to \"do more.\"  Either it's not happening much or the news of it is seriously being squelched?  (Or I'm not reading the right news sources, also a very likely possibility.) Remember, the other reason why governments license businesses and individuals (besides revenues) is this gives them control over your livelihood and the ability for you to provide for your family.  This is incredible leverage and just what they want.  Maybe so. But the alternative is anarchy, which in its purest form is severe idealism: that people can self-monitor their behavior and the natural by-product is everyone gets along and there are no violations of property or to others. Uh-huh. Maybe it's possible in a 2 person society, but even Adam and Eve had issues. Mark,See above:\"This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto. If we have arbitrary, cheap, completely anonymous transactions, tax evasion, theft (ransomware), fraud, can go haywire. If we have complete surveillance and control, political  liberty goes out the window.\"Professional licensing provides a level of accountability with the veil of anonymity lifted.  Do you really want a doctor using a pseudonym performing surgery on you or a lawyer using a phony name representing you in court? Mykel,\"Maybe it's possible in a 2 person society, but even Adam and Eve had issues.\"Adam and Eve had God around (3rd party). If I were a Canadian I would be looking to migrate, quickly. Just where to go?It certainly wouldn't hurt Oz to inherit a few freedom lovers, with a backbone. Ours could use a bit of reinforcing about now. John, I think what you mean in this sentence is \u201cprivately\u201d, not \u201canonymously\u201d :\u201cAnd the right to transact, freely and anonymously. If the government can monitor your transactions, freeze your assets, \"sanction\" you, or freeze your ability to transact, to buy or sell anything, it can quickly silence you, stop your political participation, undermine political movements or even aspiring individual politicians.\u201d Anonymity has never been a right. Privacy, or even secrecy, has a much stronger foundation.In digital tech this is a big difference. A big part of the problem with today\u2019s digital structures is anonymity.Digital privacy is an achievable goal but it does require a validation authority. Unless one believes in a world without passports, there needs to be a way to establish identity beyond a reasonable doubt. Creating that value also enables privacy because it enables individuals to encrypt their data with their digital identity.The state has a unique role in strengthening citizen freedom through private validation of identity. That will need to be recreated in the digital realm to deliver the same value in the digital as exists in the physical. This is a very good point. The best I can come up with are private payments processors, backed by treasurys or reserves, that maintain customer privacy. Government can search with a warrant, and immense legal protections. An imperfect middle, to be sure.  Maybe this will help crypto go more mainstream. I am Canadian, and while I didn\u2019t donate to the Convoy, I almost did. I have donated to other causes (generally free speech related) that the current uber-woke Canadian government might find \u2018offensive.\u2019 So I would like to move my money out of Canadian banks. Crypto is attractive for that reason\u2014but solely for that reason. I do not want to speculate in crypto, and the less I need to learn about it the better. I just want to use it as a medium term store of value that is safe from the Cdn gov\u2019t, ideally with a rate of return that is comparable to what I can earn in standard mutual funds, or a bit lower as the cost of security from government. If someone sets up that institution, there will be a lot of takers. (If it is already possible, please point me in the right direction.) \n\n\nComments are welcome.

Thanks John, great post. Best question of the day:  \"If 'markets' aren't 'valuing' green investments correctly, isn't it remotely possible that they are valuing them too much?\"But \"central planners of the economy\" do not understand their own limited knowledge horizon, and their power assures us their guessing-mistakes will hurt the evolving economy much more severely.  The Social Cost becomes gigantic from the illusion of \"planning.\"  Why not just boost the capital requirements of the coddled bankers (with access to the Fed). It's strange how people do not realize how ironic this affirmation is, as you did. How can one not sarcastically propose that the fed is better at evaluating risk than the whole of the financial sector? And if you believe this how can you be against revolving doors? We need those fed magicians working at the banks! Given the point of the Fed is to disrupt the proper functioning of financial markets, perhaps they are best positioned to foresee such risks? One of the ways the Fed adds money into the economy is by losing alpha. John,\"I should have added: there is no such thing as an orderly price adjustment. If you know prices are going down tomorrow, you sell today. One of the most classic policy fallacies is the idea that we can have a slow steady price decline.\"That's funny.  You made the opposite argument here during the Obama Administration.Remember your comments here:https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-neo-fisherian-question.html\"Keynesian deflationary spirals.

But you only need to report a positive test. So, in fact you don't have to do any tests at all... A rare endorsement of monopsony? ;) Agree on the opacity of health care costs, lack of incentives to allow at least information to be \"provided\". On the bright side, the focus on vaccines since early 2021 has been relentless. Someone has to be commended for that. If we had vax rates close to that of Denmark or Portugal, the number of deaths would be much lower. The current number is heartbreaking, as is the suffering of the families left behind. I don't know how diluted the focus on the vaccines has been by policies on masking, testing, etc. Things are not mutually exclusive, so I think the effect has been minimal and vaccines remain front and center of the public health strategy. Of course, the focus on vaccines could be even clearer, but not sure hesitancy would be lower with more aggressive efforts on that front. And at least we do not have people in positions of power at the Federal level questioning the efficacy of the vaccines. That would have been a bigger problem given how effective vaccines remain. Cheers. Seems like every nation ends up losing against Covid-19. Testing, testing, vaccinations, lockdowns, no lockdowns, masks what have you, it all ends up in the same place.If I am doing my math correctly, the latest strains of Omicron are 200 times more infectious than the original virus. And who knows, perhaps even more infectious variants are on the horizon.Covid-19 strikes me as the public health sector's Vietnamistan.Some wars you lose.

Sorry to be slow on this. I kept thinking the comments were going to another post and couldn't figure out the problem. Now fixed.  Why am I not surprised? It has always been and will remain that someone's need will be someone else's opportunity. You also make clear the point that, in the end, it is the consumer/taxpayer who foots the ultimate bill. If we want cheaper health care, someone's ox will need to be gored. Either consumers will need to accept a lower (less costly) standard of care, or health care providers, pharmaceutical companies, etc., will need to earn less. Without serious federal government action, it seems unlikely that the cost side of health care will fall anytime soon.The pandemic has also made clear that our current health care system operates on a \"just in time\" service basis. It works as long as the demand is not too high, but in the case of a broad based emergency, that model can quickly break down. Could be time to go with herd immunity. (Trump was right.) With the less deadly viruses, especially.  And if unvaccinated folk perish, it was time to cull the herd of stoopid Libertarian Republicans, in any event.   In France a PCR test is free for the citizen (you don't even need to bring a payment method) and the lab charges 40euros to the state. \n\n\nComments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

Sure, my libertarian friends, the federal government shouldn't be doing any of this and we should have universal real time tolling..... but I'm writing here about the system we have.\u00a0   Elections have consequences.  You could even go so far as to say that political parties have utility functions, and describe the utility functions based on policy choices they make.  You might even observe that politics is about divying up the pork in the 'pork-barrel'.  Indeed, you could draw on an old aphorism that dates from the Era of Trusts, to observe of today's 'progressives', \"If you can't buy [or, brow-beat and bully] a congresswoman, what good is she?\"The real failing is not on the side of the democratic party senator or representative, but it is on the side of the republican party senator or representative who falls for the con.In the parlimentary model of govenance, to be on the opposition side of the aisle is to oppose the government at each and every instant and instance.  The republican form of government seems to abhor such practices, focussing on cooperation, bi-partisanship, and other forms of compromise.  The other side of that coin is the practice of wholesale turnover of the bureaucracy whenever there is a change of party in power, in conjunction with partisan political appointees up and down the civil list.  You re-start from zero every four years.  It's no way to run a railroad.You can do little about the form of governance, but you can do much about who is given the reins of power.  The old adage, \"Vote early, vote often\", has its place in that pantheon.As to federal highway spending, the keys to the citadel have landed in the hands of those who disvalue rural communities, economic efficiency, and republican constituencies.  Grin and bear it, for the time being.  Your chance will come around, a.s. Dont worry Ill, along with plenty of voters, will vote often and democrat when were dead. Bring back earmarks. The executive branch cannot be trusted to pick good projects. Congressmen know what their constituents want. They should write into the legislation so that they don't get horsed around by bureaucratic dip wads like these. Personal automobiles are the most inefficient (particularly in terms of space) way of moving humans. Weird an economist would push for more of it when historically investment in it has been so lopsided compared to alternatives. Fix what we have, but if you're serious about moving people or goods, the the most rational electric vehicle investment for America would probably have an over head wire and run on steel tracks (trains, subways, trams). My car gets me door to door at any time I want. Public transit does not. Relative to its modal share, we spend far too much in transit Because parking for private vehicles is severely underpriced.  Private automobiles are essential for suburbs, and America's suburbs are the reason that the U.S. is not facing imminent demographic collapse, like Europe, Japan, China, etc. \"I found the original memo here. (WSJ, why do you not link to sources?)\"I've long wondered why they don't. Journalists want us to trust them but I'm a little low on trust these days. News reports that were footnoted and sourced would go a long way to enhance credibility.  The federal and state governments collect about $40 billion a year in fuel taxes and transportation excise taxes.  There are fewer than 180,000 miles of federal highways in the United States. That is more than $220k/year per mile of roadway. If half of that is channeled (diverted?) back to the states for local highways and roadways, that still leaves $110k per mile of federal highway.  Reasonable estimates of annual maintenance of multilane highways are in the $25 to $30k per mile per year. That leaves more than $75k/year per mile of existing highway to pay for major repairs or replacement.  Where did the money go?  As an economist, I hope you reconsider your desire for widening un-priced vehicle travel lanes. You're surely smart enough to know the bulk of literature refutes additional road capacity being a way to \"fix\" congestion. As you are also smart enough to know, additional road capacity induces greater SOV travel demand, increases per-capita VMT, and harms the environment \u2014 which you as economist will understand is an unpriced externality in the current road pricing framework. Yes! I'm all for real-time congestion-priced tolling everywhere. Roads are no longer public goods -- goods that you can't charge for.  The Economic literature is full of papers offering impracticable suggestions and recommendations to policy makers.  \"Congestion-priced tolling\" has been implemented on interstate highway I-405 that serves the eastern half of greater metropolitan Seattle, in the State of Washington. Policy doesn't enforce congestion pricing in all of the lanes of I-405.  The state highway 520 is also tolled, but interstate highway I-90 is not.During the 1990s, Malaysia built a 4-lane tolled highway, and charged 20 Malaysian Ringgit per one-way trip from the International Airport to Kuala Lumpur.  A beautifully designed modern roadway, it was hardly used.  Instead, the alternative route from the International Airport into Kuala Lumpur was a heavily congested two-lane secondary highway that was the inefficient but untolled alternative that ran through densely built up urban areas. The cost in productive time lost, extra wages paid for time spent behind the wheel of lorries and taxis, and exhaust emissions were a consequence of government policy following the recommendations of the learned economists such as yourself.  Those negative externalities were the result of govenment policy, and are referred to as uncompensated governmental negative externalities, you no doubt know.  Blind application of economic theorists' theories is poor economic practice.  A properly performed benefit-cost analysis would have led to levying the toll on the older highway to reduce externalities, and left the new highway untolled to encourage diversion of traffic from the older route to the newer more economically efficient route. I could not agree more. Elections have consequences.  We have seen three elections where men who have not been fully vetted by the voter has succeeded in advancing to the Presidency.  These men, each in their own way, reflect the decline of voter faith and trust in the Government to do what is right.  The three of them are examples of what happens when the voter is engaged only to appear and cast a vote. Our Congress has failed to take up the fight for Freedom and has settled into counting their pension benefits paid for by you and me.  It is a messy time for Democracy.  Here's hoping.      How do you knowv that yellow plastic crosswalks can be dangerous to bicyclists in the rain? I ride bicycles in the rain.  What is the incentive for representatives to care about the national budget? People have debt-like exposure to the government, so nobody wants governments to earn a profit. As for public needs, these are subject to the tragedy of the commons. The obvious solution here is to elect and incent representatives the same way board members are. It's even worse than you say. In Houston, they are blocking a highway project that is fully funded by state money already allocated. It appears Congress failed to write a Conference Report or Legislative History. That failure impairs or obscures the intent of the text of the law which, in turn, leaves the Biden Executive Branch to interpret the law pretty much as they see fit even if it contravenes the understanding of some of the Republican legislators who voted for it.Absurd. Why did Republicans not condition their votes on the writing of a Conference Report?https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text This comment has been removed by the author. Hi professor. I think you are wrong here. Current research on the subject is quite clear that more highways don't solve traffic problems. Your third lane one the I-5 will not be a solution. If it were true that we are no better off with more highways, then we are no worse off with less highways. Blow them up. There won't be any more traffic jams! The logical flaw: Even if traffic does not improve, more people go places. You may disparage their desire to do so, but it's important to them. Actually the research is quite flawed -- blog post coming up. Its one of those things that everyone passes around, like you should drink 8 glasses of water a day, but turns out to be very fragile  \n\n\nComments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

Instead, we saw disinflation and lower rates.The last year has been most welcome in the profession. \u201cThe risk-neutral mean is a better sufficient statistic for decisions\u201d is there a resource for a formal theory of sufficient statistics (including risk neutral means) in decision theory? Or are you using sufficient statistic loosely? Would be interesting to see this graph over a long period of rising interest rates.   This comment has been removed by the author. The 10 yr bond interest rate forecasts are available for analysis at:https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/tbondThe forecasts of the individual forecast professionals can be downloaded as an Excel file.  Mean and median statistics are also available in Excel format but, as summary statistics, these measures are less useful for purposes of analysis of forecasting accuracy, e.g., (expected minus actual)/actual.Forecasts are given by calendar quarter, enabling analysis of dynamic recalibration by individual forecaster.  The result is greater \"color\" in the data available to the data analyst.Torsten Slok's remark is hardly newsworthy. Forecasts are usually taken with a grain of salt.  It is not the mean, or the median, forecast that is useful, but the individual forecaster whose forecasting ability has demonstrated a consistent record of accuracy that is worth listening to. Find that individual or handful of individuals and pay attention to their estimates and expressed expectations.  The forecast survey data, not the statistical measures, is the critical information. This is a GREAT graph and great post.  I have grabbed this chart and shared it with friends on numerous occasions whenever we speak of inflation/rates and they go into...but the market isn't expecting...Broader question - what does a chart say about standard economic theories that depend on correct long-run expectations - should we still be making predictions based on P=E[mX] when \"E\" can be so screwed up for so long....?  Of course we can re-classify the mistake into \"the required rate of return\" but that seems so unappealing.   I think you are missing the point: long run expectations are already embedded in the price, but that price also embeds the cost of risk. You can't distill true expectations unless you have a perfect pricing model that can calculate the price of risk. As a shorthand, media and market participants refer to \"market expectations\" all the time. Knowingly or not, those are only pseudo expectations, accurate solely in a risk neutral world. Forecasters, intriguingly, seem to do the same thing.    Very interesting graph. When I was at Booth I did a paper on market sentiment/forecasters and correlation with the following periods of market movement. It was focused on the short term in commodity markets, but sentiment was generally correlated well with the previous period--recent rally, expect more of the same. The only forecasters with good records were forecasters in markets with positive serial correlation (long trends). This \"broken clock syndrome\" is interesting in the long run. And I've had my issues with the wind forecasts from NOAA as well. As a devout windsurfer, I grew frustrated with the forecasts always well above the measured windspeeds. I even did an unscientific study and contacted NOAA about the perils of crying wolf. No reply, but forecasts today are much more accurate than in the past.  https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/media/Lehrstuehle/vwl/Adam/AdamMatveevNagel_JME.pdfThis JME paper shows quite convincingly that your explanation of risk-neutral or pessimistically-tilted expectations cannot be correct.

The right answer would seem to be, if you are not vaccinated, health insurance will adjust your premiums, as they do for smokers. Why must higher premiums for unvaccinated people be illegal?\u00a0   Good points. I'm particularly I'm favor of vaccines and got all the required shoots. However, I don't really blame the average Joe if he doesn't want to take the vaccine because he doesn't trust the public health \"experts\". I mean, come on, besides all the points you talked about we still had: WHO being against masks, WHO saying that in cooperation with Chinese officers they found no evidence of human to human transmission (I even have print screens from their tweets), hundreds (HUNDREDS!) of epidemiologists signing a letter saying that BLM protests, in the most critical moment of the pandemic, were necessary and presented no significant risk of transmission. Those are all valid reasons for being angry with public health officials and thinking the CDC and the WHO need radical overhauls.  They are not reasons for refusing to take the vaccine.  The germ theory of disease is real. The disease is likely to be transmitted through the air - in which case masks and social distancing are prudent.  At this point there have been so many hundreds of millions of vaccine doses given that the safety and efficacy should be readily apparent whether or not you would trust the CDC or the WHO to tell you the time of day.  It makes no sense to say \"the CDC lied to me at the start when they downplayed the seriousness so they must be lying and exaggerating the seriousness now.\"   COVID vaccines: The COVID vaccines have killed tens of thousands of people and injured hundreds of thousands of people (https://openvaers.com/covid-data). More people have died from the COVID vaccines than from all of the other vaccines combined since 1997. And the vaccinated are not protected from getting or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and dying from COVID (see Belgium, Israel, UK, Iceland, Ireland, Singapore, Gibralter, etc., all highly vaccinated countries), so what is he point of the vaccines especially if they weaken our immune systems and make us more likely to have complications and die from COVID?https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/new-big-data-study-of-145-countries - New big data study of 145 countries show COVID vaccines makes things worse (cases and deaths). The study found that the COVID vaccines cause more COVID cases per million (+38% in US) and more deaths per million associated with COVID (+31% in US).https://popularrationalism.substack.com/p/in-the-united-states-vaccination - James Lyons-Weiler recently showed that the US state data shows that the more we vaccinate, the higher the # of COVID cases.https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19843315.covid-scotland-case-rates-lowest-unvaccinated-double-jabbed-elderly-drive-rise-hospital-admissions/ - COVID Scotland: Case rates lowest in unvaccinated as double-jabbed elderly drive rise in hospital admissions.According to Dr. Robert Malone: A statement out of Israel reports a nosocomial outbreak involving 16 healthcare workers, 23 exposed patients and two family members. The source was a fully vaccinated COVID-19 patient. The vaccination rate was 96.2% among all 248 exposed individuals (151 healthcare workers and 97 patients). Out of the 248 people, fourteen fully vaccinated patients became severely ill or died, and two unvaccinated patients developed mild diseaseMasks: The COVID-19 virus is tiny and most masks are ineffective at stopping the virus because the diameter of coronavirus \u2014 is 0.13 microns (a micron is 1,000 times smaller than a millimeter). The best N95 standard mask only filters down to 0.3 microns, therefore the masks are ineffective in stopping transmission of COVID. Wearing a mask is like putting up a chain link fence to stop mosquitos. I think most people know that masks are useless for stopping COVID and masks are harmful for socializing, learning, breathing, peer interaction, and masks are devastating for autistic and deaf children. Masks can also cause bacterial and fungal infections, etc. Even the CDC and former FDA director Scott Gottlieb said masks do not stop coronaviruses.And, according to a study by Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University (https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2031), young children showed a 22-point drop in IQ (IQ dropped from 100 to 78 - therefore children went from average intelligence (100 IQ) to retarded (78 IQ). The 22-point drop in IQ in young children is because the masks, lockdowns, and social distancing, etc., cause a lack of stimulation from peers, parents, grandparents, etc.Solution: There are over 213 million people in Nigeria but less than 3,200 COVID deaths. Could the Nigerians have a low death rate (.0001) from COVID because they take hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) daily to prevent malaria? Could therapeutics/medications (combination of ivermectin, Fluvoxamine, and Methylprednisolone along with HCQ/Quercetin, zinc, vitamin D3 and C, as well as monoclonal antibodies) be the answer to treating/curing COVID?No one needs to die from COVID if we use medications and therapeutics like the ones listed above for prevention and early treatment, and if we encourage people to keep their weight in check, exercise, and eat and sleep well. Aye, Aye! I am unhappy with the quality of most public health guidance and believe they should have been better.  On the other hand there seem to be legions of bad faith actors perfectly happy to seize on anything they can to get their own piece of the public attention.  Some of those bad faith actors are in politics and some are in the media and some are trying to establish followings on social media.  To say that immunity acquired by having had Covid gives better protection than getting the vaccine is meaningless, or worse, if you are 1,000 times more likely to die from having Covid than from getting the vaccine.  When you have been deluded it's really hard to accept reality. Good luck with that. COVID has a 99% survival rate for those under age 70, and not recognizing natural immunity and early treatment has let to disastrous outcomes and deaths.Drs Ioannidis & Axfors at Stanford - survival rate for COVID Age         Infection Survival Rate0-19        99.9973%20-29     99.986%30-39     99.969%40-49     99.918%50-59     99.73%60-69     99.41%70+         97.6% (non-inst.)70+         94.5% (all)https://brownstone.org/articles/natural-immunity-and-covid-19-twenty-nine-scientific-studies-to-share-with-employers-health-officials-and-politicians/ - 30 peer reviewed scientific studies showing the protection and longevity of natural immunityIf, per Fauci, everyone will get omicron/COVID, regardless of vaccination status, masks, social distancing, etc., then we can abolish all COVID restrictions and stop the vaccine mandates?89% of Covid-19 deaths in the UK are among the fully vaccinated, which proves this is a \u2018pandemic of the fully vaccinated\u2019 and suggests the vaccinated are more likely to die. The fully vaxed are the ones filling up hospitals in the US and in other countries.The COVID vaccines do not prevent the vaccinated from getting and/or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and/or dying from COVID? Why mandate ineffective vaccines when there are highly effective therapeutics/medications (Ivermectin, nitazoxanide, proxalutamide, Fluvoxamine, azithromycin, Methylprednisolone, spironolactone, dutasteride, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Quercetin/HCQ, and zinc) as well as Regeneron\u2019s monoclonal antibody therapy to treat COVID and prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and/or death. \"Because the CDC thinks we're morons and can't understand that, so it must suppress evidence of natural immunity to scare people into vaccination.\"The CDC can protect itself by pointing to numbers of vaccinations. Natural immunity does nothing for the CDC. It's all quite rational.What bothers me personally is only their brazenness.  Excellent blogging. The war on Covid-19 has become the public health sector's Vietnamistan. The issue aren't false beliefs like anti vax that go against 'expert' or 'elite' opinion. The FAR more worrisome issue are the patently false beliefs of the elite and 'experts' themselves, on issues such as sexual identity, race, criminology, psychometrics, etc. These drive actual policy impacting almost every aspect of governance from education, immigration, welfare, taxation, police enforcement, sentencing, etc. And they repeatedly get it wrong and double down on insanity. I'll gladly take some populistic dumb takes over that.  There is a good point here. Every lie undermines every truth. When public health authorities ration vaccines to \"redress historic inequities,\" as they did in California, then people use that information when deciding whether their current advice has scientific merit. And people don't necessarily appreciate the fine lines between bureaucracies as we do. Every bit of fantastical spin by Washington politicians and bureaucrats undermines trust in the occasional quite reasonable pronouncement by other Washington politicians or bureaucrats. After the boy cried wolf too many times, they also ignore the girl who cries wolf when the real wolf appears.  I agree.  Whether they like it or not, all \"experts\" are part of a meta-guild of \"experts\".  Their credibility is held jointly.  If they had a code of ethics, one of the rules would be \"Nothing false\".  Anyone in any field who undermines trust does so across the board.  It's not fair or logical; it's the way people respond. \"As it becomes clear that vaccines do not stop transmission\" Could you please qualify this statement to make clear that vaccines do not *fully* stop transmission, but they reduce transmission, both through preventing many infections altogether and by reducing viral load among those who do get infected despite vaccination. Oh like the US Naval vessel that was quarantined last week? Everyone on board was fully vaccinated but 236 plus crew members came down with the Wuhan. This comment has been removed by the author. \"I tried to get a booster in September and ran in to forbidden. Before it became mandatory.\"I could tell the same story, except that my brother is an experienced pulmonary physician. He coached me on the magic words to use to get around the bureaucratic barrier.Not to put too fine a point on it, but, I lied and got my booster. I don't feel bad about it. In the referenced study cited at the WSJ, do the authors control for hospitalization of previously infected people? Ex-ante, I am not surprised that previously infected people have lower chances of being hospitalized because they have proved to have good immunity to survive the first time they were exposed to the virus. Also, even if they control for previously hospitalizations, my assumption is that these people would be more careful after coming out of the hospital, so even if they get re-infected perhaps the viral load is low because they have been more careful. Am I missing something?  I agree that vaccination remains the safest public health strategy. We are ok there. We may also agree that, current lies or not, vaccination remains the most important or a key part of the strategy, so I am ok to accept the noise (lies, mishaps, miscommunication, etc). While data on reinfection rates and more transparency (now, in the past and future) should be expected, the focus on vaccination may be more effective than a plethora of measures that may muddy the waters, especially for the average folk \"doing their research\". So, while the overall approach of government agencies should feature more transparency regarding data, the public policy strategy should focus on the most effective tools, or tool in this case. \"Get vaccinated and wear a mask when indoors\" is not much of an ask frankly, and it is a clear line. Whether \"the CDC\" thinks we're morons is a bit besides the point frankly. Most of us have cognitive/information processing limitations (kids' homework, bills to pay, other health issues, etc) and a simple line that is adjusted in line with the preponderance of evidence is called for; do the vaccines remain the best tool? Yes. Any reason not to wear better masks indoor? No. Recalibrate type of mask in public communication. Boosters needed? Add that \"Get vaxxed, get boosted\". Rinse and repeat. Mistakes will be made. Has the focus on vaccines waned? No. Good then. Again, regardless of whether \"the CDC\" thinks we are morons. We should continue to review the experience, including in 2020 to learn and incorporate lessons going forward. Same with natural immunity. But only add to broader public policy strategy if there is a clear message with positive payoffs. The fact that 15 thousand people are expected to die over the next week when vaccines are widely available, indicates that there are morons out there. I wager that they are not \"doing their own research\" on the cost and benefits of natural immunity - instead they watch a certain set of TV channels and worship a few personalities (there are data on that, don't take my word for it). And nothing wrong with that, this is a free country. I hope the unvaccinated stay safe, don't get sick, and wish they would join smokers in my health insurance plans. But none of the above change the fact that public policy is largely appropriate as it continues to focus on the the best available tool to reduce hosp/mortality: vaccines. If there is confusion about masks and boosters, no need to add new guidance or recommendations focused on natural immunity. More, not less, of a KISS approach is needed here. Parsimony and common sense should not be underrated. Cheers.      Our hospitals would not have to treat anyone with COVID, whether vaxxed or not, if the medical community would emphasize early treatment with therapeutics/medications (Ivermectin, nitazoxanide, proxalutamide, Fluvoxamine, azithromycin, Methylprednisolone, spironolactone, dutasteride, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Quercetin/HCQ, and zinc) as well as Regeneron\u2019s monoclonal antibody therapy to treat COVID and prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and/or death.Why have we lost our collective minds and constitutional rights over a virus that has a 99% plus survival rate for those under age 70? Why would anyone require proof of vaccination when the vaccines do not prevent the vaccinated from getting and/or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and/or dying from COVID? https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/new-big-data-study-of-145-countries - New big data study of 145 countries show COVID vaccines makes things worse (cases and deaths). The study found that the COVID vaccines cause more COVID cases per million (+38% in US) and more deaths per million associated with COVID (+31% in US).https://twitter.com/BLNewsMedia/status/1434622637653823494 - fully vaccinated Oscar De La Hoya's comeback fight was delayed by a COVID hospitalization, meanwhile podcaster Joe Rogan, maligned for being unvaccinated, recovers in 3 days with treatments, like Ivermectin, vitamin D3, C, zinc, and monoclonal antibodies.Why mandate ineffective vaccines when there are highly effective therapeutics/medications (Ivermectin, nitazoxanide, proxalutamide, Fluvoxamine, azithromycin, Methylprednisolone, spironolactone, dutasteride, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Quercetin/HCQ, and zinc) as well as Regeneron\u2019s monoclonal antibody therapy to treat COVID and prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and/or death. The fundamental flaw in policy is that you should lie to get people to behave in the right way.When Fauci tells kids he vaccinated Santa, this is no exception to how many leaders at the CDC and NIH operate: Lie to get the behavior you want. This approach is only warranted when: 1. You actually know what's best 2. The population could never comprehend the truth. Neither is true here.This highlights why there needs to be a division between topic-expertise can policy formation. The best doctors will fail to formulate optimal policy when they don't get economics or statistics, or have incentive to balance the various needs of the population.  I agree that the CDC should be more open with its data and that many public experts have done a terrible job. However, I doubt this is responsible for much of the vaccine hesitancy we are seeing. The posts I see my family post on facebook about the vaccine are about autism or the naive belief that because vaccines don't prevent infection they don't work at all. These people wouldn't take the vaccine even if the CDC had been more transparent. I'd also argue that refusing to treat the unvaccinated is inhumane if there aren't enough resources to go around. If there's one hospital bed and two people -- one who reduced the risk of Covid and the other who chose not to -- the former should be the one to get it in my view. I'd agree that unvax premiums should be legal though :) It is the vaxxed who are ending up in the hospitals sick and dying from COVIDhttps://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/new-big-data-study-of-145-countries - New big data study of 145 countries show COVID vaccines makes things worse (cases and deaths).

Another egregious example is the Proximal Origins paper in Nature Communications in which several prominent virologists argued that \u201cwe do not believe that any type of laboratory based scenario is plausible,\u201d even though FOIAed emails reveal that several of them had privately expressed the view that a natural original was unlikely only days before writing the paper: eg Garry said \u201cI just can\u2019t figure out how this [gain of function] gets accomplished in nature.\u201d Fauci was in on those emails. The Proximal Origins paper apepars to have been written under pressure from Fauci and Collins. The 11 January letter from the Oversight Committee has details. We\u2019ll start trusting the experts when they start being trustworthy. I won\u2019t be holding my breath: apparently Fauci was on the radio just this week saying a lab leak is very unlikely. It\u2019s really just insane behaviour \u2014 they seem to be actively doing their best to destroy trust in science.https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Letter-Re.-Feb-1-Emails-011122.pdf This comment has been removed by the author. It is my understanding that vaccines reduce your odds of infection and also reduce the amount of time that you are infectious. Also, they do both of these reductions better if you get 2 doses rather than 1 one. Also, better if you get 3 doses rather than 2.The public discourse is too often in boolean statements when probabilities statements would be more accurate. This certainly undermines the trust of the public. Adjustment of health insurance premiums is the sensible response in the US, but obviously isn't possible in countries with a public health system, i.e., most of them. In principle, the same thing could be achieved via a surcharge or tax, but this would be administratively cumbersome and of doubtful effectiveness. In such circumstances, some kind of quantity rationing in health may be the only feasible response. Far from 'inhuman', that would seem to be a far kinder, and more directly consequential, policy than depriving people  of their careers, social circles, and ability to access all kinds of services.    Inflation!Why isn't anyone listening?   Why do so many Americans believe crazy things? Maybe not \"crazy,\" but beliefs that wildly get wrong factual costs and benefits, such as those of vaccines? It does not help that they have been lied to, over and over again. Why should they believe anything now? Our elites, and in particular our public health bureaucrats, though invoking the holy name of \"science,\" have been trying to massage public psychology via deliberate obfuscation for a few years now. There is little science of managing public psychology, and if there is, epidemiologists don't have it. There is some good ancient wisdom, as codified in the story of the boy who cried wolf.  We do know that when lies are exposed, when elites are shown to be disparaging and trying to manipulate average people, trust erodes.Anxieties regarding the \"management\" of the public has been around a good long time. Plato's  The Republic  is a lamentation about the end of idealism. His position that the philosophers (the elite) should run the city-state was rooted in a severe mistrust of the public. Machiavelli \"modernized\" his position and it became about how to manipulate the public as so to prevent instability/chaos.Point is, there has been a long history of distrust of the public, for it's the belief that they cannot manage their affairs properly, and thus, it needs to be chosen for them. Remember that \"The Prince\" was rewritten by Hobbes in \"The Leviathan,\" and Locke would later rewrite it for his cultural epoch during the Rationalist Enlightenment, which heavily influenced the Founding Fathers. Even Jefferson had a severe mistrust of the public.This is nothing new, but it wrestles with the problem that in the end, people just don't like being told what to do. Freedom only exists in a confined, pre-determined structure. Michel Foucault's \"Madness and Civilization\" isn't really about mental health: it's about how society has a built in immune system to remove and isolate those that do not fit into recognizable society or refuse to adhere to \"established norms.\"I suppose this goes to the idea of \"useful myths.\" The problem arises when the veil is pierced and there's a swamp of contradictory data and opinions lurking beneath.  I am fully-vaccinated and boostered based on my personal situation and risk assessment. I consider the broad resistance to all vaccines a tragedy but it should be obvious that shame, insults and coercion build resentment and make the problem of vaccine resistance worse.  Sure, if sweet reason would work that is preferable.  If appeals to the common good would work, that would be preferable.  In my case, I have a couple of young adult children who were vaccine hesitant until the British Columbia government said: \"if you want to go to a bar or restaurant then you need to vaccinated\"; at which point they got vaccinated.  But the aggressive anti-vaxxers who seize on any quibble or nuance and treat it as a complete rebuttal are not susceptible to reason so we are left with: \"get vaccinated or stay away from us\".  We are at a point where soon we will start lifting more restrictions but that is just because the number of unvaccinated has declined to the point where the hospitals and morgues will be able to handle the extra cases.   Common good \u2014- interesting. Whose common good?  You NEVER sacrifice personal liberty and freedom for the collective good \u2014- that is the mantra of communism. I will not take this vaccine and not because I\u2019m an anti-vaxxer. By the designers\u2019 own admission, it\u2019s not a vaccine. Vaccines PREVENT acquisition of said disease. This SHOT guarantees nothing, except a less severe case of a disease with over a 99% survival rate. Also, numerous scientific reports show that 4 times as many spores were present in vaccinated people. Here is the foundational problem of lying and misleading humans: in order to maintain your illusion you have to censor all opposition or vilify any expert whose data contradicts your lie  Another problem with dishonesty is that once your illusion in shown to be fiction you have two options: come clean or continue the narrative. World leaders, both medical and political,  opted for the latter. Problem: the veil has been lifted. Too many reports, from over 149 countries including the US, show the VACCINATED ARE DYING AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE UNVACCINATED. Healthy young men dying of Myocarditis, women delivering stillborn children or miscarrying, extremely fit professional athletes dying of cardiac arrests \u2014/ all after vaccination. These are not isolated nor unrelated. If we are saying science is driving the vaccine, then why aren\u2019t these side effects from a \u201csafe\u201d vaccine being widely reported and investigated?  None of the MSM has reported on this \u2014- their job is to continue the narrative and they have the majority of the population as their viewing audience. All this aside, I find your rationale both disconcerting and cruel at best, and manipulative and hateful at its worse. If you research behaviors associated with Hitler\u2019s brown shirts, you will find you share much of the bravado that made them a lethal medicine to Nazi opponents, and ultimately to the great nation of Germany.  Their goal was also the COMMON GOOD of German people. Their tactics: first, propaganda. Next, coercion. Then, intimidation. Then, violence.  Then, use of fellow Germans to isolate and betray their fellow man, and finally, death to any opposition. Forcing compliance for Common Good, however pure your paint your motives, eventually eradicates freedom and liberty for your opposition, and ultimately\u2014- you.  We ARE morons. Unfortunately, the WSJ article you cite is behind a paywall, but that's OK as I stopped reading their OpEds long ago.I suspect the CDC research they refer to is dated 1/19/22 and be reached at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm.Several thoughts struck me as I read the summary of findings on this study: 1) we knew nothing about Covid 19 and how to treat it when it first appeared. 2) our understanding of Covid 19, how it affects people and how to treat it, has constantly evolved since, especially as new variants have emerged, and 3) numerous mistakes by politicians and scientific communities along the way have only made things worse. Two years into the pandemic, its easy to claim that masks and lockdowns haven't made any difference, but that's a position impossible to defend as we simply don't know what the outcome would have been had we not taken these measures.The CDC article cited above does make clear that so-called \"natural\" immunity may, in fact, be stronger than that conferred through vaccination. However, and this cannot be underscored enough, natural immunity can only obtained through actually contracting the virus, which may lead to serious illness, hospitalization or death. Being vaccinated on the other hand, reduces the likelihood of being infected in the first place and if infected, can reduce the severity and mortality of being infected.The WSJ's article may suggest that natural immunity is better than that conveyed through vaccination, but the CDC's conclusion remains the same: \"Initial infection among unvaccinated persons increases risk for serious illness, hospitalization, long-term sequelae, and death.....Thus, vaccination remains the safest and primary strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections, associated complications, and onward transmission.\" \"However, and this cannot be underscored enough, natural immunity can only obtained through actually contracting the virus, which may lead to serious illness, hospitalization or death.\"Oh look - its our old friend selection bias.   More specifically, survivorship bias. A reoccurring issue in the mutual fund performance literature.  Thierry are six questions I have asked since the vaccine \u201cpush\u201d began:1) Vaccine development and approval is a 7-10 year project \u2014- based on all previous vaccines. How did this vaccine go from inception to injection in under a year??2) THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY\u2014 SCIENCE \u2014- has always said natural immunity is the best. Yet before they,d even isolated the COVID 19 germ or developed a VALID, ACCURATE test, these \u201cexperts\u201d were saying a vaccine was better than natural immunity. When did our immune systems stop doing their designated job of producing antibodies to disease?  3) I\u2019ve never had vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough because many \u201cboomers\u201d had these diseases. only children that hadn\u2019t had the disease received the vaccination and then 99.9% of them never got the disease and didn\u2019t need a \u201cbooster\u201d to maintain the immunity the vaccine provided. The COVID vaccine doesn\u2019t prevent the disease. How can it be called a vaccine if it doesn\u2019t prevent the disease it\u2019s targeting?4) EVERY SARS VACCINE trial ended at ferret trials (COVID is. SARS variant.). A ferret\u2019s immune system is most similar to a human\u2019s. There were two side effects as each vaccine went through these trials: death and immune system response disorder, which usually resulted in death from another infection due to a compromised immune system. Why were ferret trials skipped  and this vaccine rushed to humans?5) Once 10 deaths are tied to a vaccine it is pulled. Over 250 professional athletes have DIED from cardiovascular episodes shortly after receiving their vaccine. The information is out there. We\u2019ve lost over 100 boys under age 17 with myocarditis\u2014- 100 young men \u2014- dead \u2014- who are not even high risk. Hundreds of women have miscarried or their children were stillborn. All of them vaccinated. Why are these vaccines still being administered?  6) Whole populations, in this case, the world, have never been expected to be guinea pigs for experimental products, ie vaccines. Why is the world\u2019s population being used as \u201cferrets\u201d to test this experimental vaccine?  And a final question, why did the Emergency Covid Act excuse Big Pharma from any financial responsibility due to injury or death from their products???Food for thought:  these three Pharmaceutical Giants are expected to net trillions of dollars from their \u201cvaccines\u201d. Which begs one more question: Why would any government allow experimentation on their citizens, remove all liability from producer of said product, unless there was something for them?I\u2019ve always believed you follow the money. If you think logically about the last two years and the lies and misinformation, a conclusion is very easy to draw. YOU CANT CLAIM SCIENCE IS YOUR IMPETUS FOR DECISIONS WHEN YOU DISPARAGE SCIENCE THAT PROVES YOUR HYPOTHESIS WAS WRONG AT ITS FOUNDATION AND CONTINUE TO MISINFORM THE PUBLIC WITHOUT EXPECTATION OF SOMETHING AT THE BACKSIDE OF THE CIRCUS OF FEAR YOU SET INTO MOTION.  \"How did this vaccine go from inception to injection in under a year??\"For the same reason that the United States was able to go from virtually nothing to building 60,000 aircraft per year and large numbers of aircraft carriers after WWII started.  The United States (and the world generally) has enormous intellectual, financial and industrial resources available to apply to an urgent problem.  Brilliant! \"You NEVER sacrifice personal liberty and freedom for the collective good\" If Australians understood this point, life here would be a whole lot more bearable. nice \n\n\nComments are welcome.

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog \u00a0  Not as bad as you might think.\u00a0   If that is the case, then a long-term investor really has not suffered any decline in long-run purchasing power. If your plan was to hold stocks for a long time, and effectively live off the dividends (including all cash flows), then nothing has changed. Sure, it would be better if you had gotten off your butt and sold ahead of the decline. But effectively market timing is difficult as a consistent strategy. Maybe inflation was all \"transitory\" \"supply shocks\" and the Fed would not have to do anything.\u00a0 Likewise, should you sell now? Well, has the market priced in all the likely interest-rate rises coming either from the Fed or from markets whether the Fed likes it or not? Maybe the Fed's forecasts are right that inflation will largely die out this year. Maybe not. Place your bets.

Similarly, if the value of all houses falls, you really do not care to first order, since the value of the house you want to buy fell just as much as the value of the house you want to sell. Indeed, you save on property and capital gains taxes. \u00a0  Just rephrasing your logic (which I find intuitive), long-term investors should care about cash flow news, but not really care about discount rate news. Here's an interesting extension to your analysis (well, interesting from my perspective): how should long-term investors care about their exposures to market neutral investment strategies (like value, momentum, etc.)? It's less obvious how the returns to these strategies break down into their \"cash flow\" and \"discount rate\" components. I think a Campbell & Vuolteenaho (2004) style decomposition would be helpful in understanding the recent moves in these strategies, and help long-term investors think about their exposures to these strategies (either implicitly or explicitly).  I should have said \"it's less obvious how _recent returns_ to these strategies break down into their...\". Anyway, you get the idea.  Long term investors should care about discount rates. Even in the, very theoretical, case that future cash-flows remain the same they would be \"paying\" a diferent price for exercicing the \"flexibility\" of moving these cash-flows around that markets of liquid assets provide.Let's imaging that I am a long term investor that has perfectly matched my future liabilities with the future dividend payments from my portfolio. Then unexpected liabilites come due (afterall live is what really happens while you are making wrong forecasts). I prefer to face those unexpected liabilities in the \"December discount rate enviroment\" rather than in the \"last Monday discount rate enviroment\", to be perfectly honest. Brilliant post. Thanks for sharing.  Also,How should long term investors structure their liabilities relative to their assets?Note: We can't all be bankers, borrowing short to invest long.\"Prices being somewhat sticky, higher nominal interest rates will mean a higher real interest rate...\"Hmmm, if prices were so \"sticky\" then they should be sticky in both directions - up and down.  So why did supposedly \"sticky\" prices rise to begin with? Frank, my thoughts on why \"sticky\" prices rose. Large scale asset purchases by the FED. (9 trillion now on its balance sheet). Real interest rates were zero or negative. How does this affect CAPM or 3 factor models? Low nominal rates pushed investors searching for yield into risky assets. With a rise in rates, markets decline. As an exercise, play with interest rates in a Dividend Discount Model (DDM). It gives  an insight to this discussion.    It is not clear that the Fed will raise interest rates so quickly. The time to be frugal is before borrowing before you spend it all on poker chips. Once the game is lost, and the debt is owed, frugality eats into utility much more severely. Mechanically, because of declining marginal utility to wealth, being frugal before borrowing is less painful than afterwards, unless you invested wisely rather than consuming. The US has found that it's \"investment\" in bailouts did not earn much in terms of long-run productivity. What should it do now? Our borrowing gambler has two choices: eat into wealth in a way that was more painful than before he borrowed, or defaulting. If the political will to be frugal or investing prowess was not present before borrowing, it is unlikely to be there afterwards.Thus, our gambler will almost certainly end up defaulting. The most painless way to default is via inflation, and that is most likely how this will go down. My guess is that the US tried to avoid inflation in 1929-1930 to avoid the mistakes of Germany a few years prior. What the US didn't realize is that massive defaults on debt generates more political instability than inflation. My vote would be the same here: Default on the debt via inflation. In the long run, the only way to avoid inflation is by avoiding a budget deficit. As long as you have a deficit, it's just a matter of when. Obviously, the advice to the US would be to run the Federal government profitably, but that is politically impossible given the incentives of voters and representatives. Clueless. As the sage said: \"in the short run, the market is a voting machine, in the long run, the market is a weighing machine.\" (attributed to Benjamin Graham)Unless you are a \"professional voter\" best to stick to the weighing machine strategies.   Today's markets were fascinating from an intellectual standpoint. They went down at the start of the trading day, and continued in read only to recover and end up in green by the end of the day. Amazing. To me, this is a discount rate mechanism, which is what John (I believe) is suggesting in his post. But the come back we have seen at the end of the trading day seems to me more related to important players trying to cover their losses. Now, there are many news going on that are difficult to reconcile and that could potentially lead to cashflow story behind markets today (e.g., Ukraine-Russia war?).  This comment has been removed by the author. I remember Larry Summers making a related point: that the increase in wealth in recent years has been accompanied by declining expected returns, leaving those with such wealth in pretty much the same place as they were before. Nice post. Some thoughts. Long term buy and hold tends to outperform actively managed portfolios. As an aside, my alpha as a hedge fund trader and manager was zero. Where on the long term horizon is the investor? If they are are 25, they have 40 years to build wealth with portfolios invested 100% in market ETF's. At age 65, they will have likely moved their holdings to about 60% cash. If some investors are truly rational, they will have bought in a declining market with a strategy such as, for every 5% market decline, they buy with 1% of their cash position.     A 65 year old 60% in cash is seriously underestimating the risk that he might live to 90. People are over reacting to volatility. Since 1950 the S&P 500 has spent ~50% of the time down more than 5% from the previous all time high and has averaged being down ~10% from the previous all time high.  Anyone who is going to panic at a 10% drop has stumbled into the wrong bar.   On a 10-12 years horizon, what the Fed does or doesn't do will have little influence on the stock market performance. Returns have been front loaded and the probability of positive real total return into 2032 are very low.

So important, in fact, that I wrote a distilled version of the original keynote speech for RIAs (no, few read long papers or listen to long presentations): https://alphaarchitect.com/2021/07/08/leading-emh-economist-john-cochrane-advocates-for-advisor-fees/Sadly, the dynamics of the industry favor those with asset gathering skills rather than the ability to help smooth consumption. Most individual investors want to pay alms to their false prophets and in return be told how safe they are before they doze off to sleep. Those few willing to read and capable to understand John's blasphemy don't bother hiring advisors. Especially now that the Dimensional Fund Advisors' barn gates are open. Still, I'm glad John is trying and happy to lend a hand.   I should note, John certainly doesn't imply \"fees are justified\" and I admit as much (I had hoped) by calling my title click bait in the opening sentence. Very few advisors follow his advice and thus justify their fees. For the average individual, the following are likely to be the largest purchases over a lifetime:1.  Primary residence2.  Transporatation (personal vehicles)3.  Energy4.  Higher education5.  Medical careDo any of these fall into the \"long term asset portfolio\" for investors? If you don't confine your assets to \"financial assets\" that have some promise to pay cash flows (and I think John does), you end of investing in NFTs and Crypto (or maybe Jackson Pollock paintings...not saying you can't eventually sell anything higher in the future). Plus, these non-financial assets on your list cover a liability (a place to live, need to get somewhere, live comfortably, converse intelligently, and avoid sickness) so can live outside of your portfolio. Not that you were really serious, but as John points out, all these assets are dwarfed by your own human capital (i.e., your ability to make your own cash flow). That asset is what needs the most tending to and arguably while value stocks that do poorly in a recession offer a risk premium.  John,\"The paper grows out of the summary I used to give for MBA and PhD students.\"Do you tell those students they are wasting their (or their parents) money pursuing a higher education (MBA or PhD degree) and should instead be plowing that money into the stock / bond markets? \"Buy stocks for the dividends\".  What? Stock returns come from value appreciation, not dividends.  If you own a $100 share of stock, and then there's a $5 dividend, then you own a $95 share of stock and $5 cash. This is a common and important fallacy. Short-run stock returns do come from value appreciation (or depreciation!) But the title is \"for the long-run investor.\" Value appreciation can only go so far. The price/earnings, or price/dividend ratio can only grow so far. Eventually, when price/earnings or price/dividend ratios run out of steam, the long-run return is completely dominated by the growth in dividends (including all cash payouts to investors.)  Thanks for the response, but I disagree. I feel like you're neglecting share buybacks.  Also, there's nothing stopping a company growing for hundreds of years, making profits and reinvesting them (or share buybacks if there are not growth opportunities).And again, dividends only come from value appreciation.  A company can't give a $5 dividend unless they actually appreciated in value the $5 first.  Dividends are merely a mechanism for transferring cash from the company to shareholders and dividends are not the only such mechanism. Jacob, you are correct there is nothing stopping a company growing for hundreds of years and reinvesting all its profits and/or buying its shares back. And yes, buybacks are equivalent to dividends in terms of transferring cash to shareholders (and arguably, much more tax efficient). But John's point is that even then, after hundreds of years, there is a limit to growth and a finite number of shares to buy back. Perhap in this future world, this fantasy company has swallowed up all other companies and all but one of its shareholders. Even then, that single remaining shareholder would demand some reward for sticking around.  1) If a company grows at the same rate (or less) as the economy/whatever, then the company has not \"swallowed up all other companies\" even after arbitrary time has passed.2) There are a finite and unbounded number of shares that can exist.  Imagine that every time the share price reaches $100, there is a 2-for-1 split.  Running out of shares for share buybacks is not an issue.Perhaps you should first imagine a simpler scenario where a company provides long-term value without ever paying a dividend AND NO GROWTH.  Imagine a company that every year makes exactly $50K in profit and spends that $50K on share buybacks.  Every time the share price reaches $100, there's a 2-for-1 split.  This goes on for as long as you wish.  There you go; a very modest company providing long term value for investors without a single dividend and no growth.You can add growth to the picture.  Every year the economy grows as 2% and the company's profits grow at 1% (this goes on for quite some time until we saturate the observable universe with the most economically efficient arrangement of matter and energy).  The company reinvests some of its profits and spends the rest on share buybacks.  Shares are splits as needed.  Over time the company is a smaller proportion of the overall economy despite growing every year. sory, correction to my first reply. I did say a \"finite number of shares...\" at first. That was wrong. I should have said \"finite number of shareholders...\" Why would number of shareholders dwindle over time?  That is not necessarily so.Even if there is only one remaining shareholder, that is no obstacle to share buybacks allowing the company to deliver cash flows to that single shareholder.Your objections are very puzzling to me. I think we both agree that everything else being equal, over any discrete time period, shareholders  are indifferent if the company pays dividends, buys back stock, reinvests in more factories or stock piles cash. It's pure Modigliani-Miller. But....1) Who do you expect to eventually buy the company that is growing (or not) to become a trivial part of the economy with no promise of a payout? Not that the \"great fool theory\" isn't alive and well in NFT and  Crypto space, but stops any  interesting discussion of finance.2) I said shareholders, not shares. Eventually, the sold remaining shareholder needs to find a \"rational\" (see note 1) counterparty whether they own 1 share or a million. I do agree it helps to create real but simplified worlds (aka models) to help explain our much messier reality. In fact, I  did so a few years ago in this article on buybacks: https://alphaarchitect.com/2018/08/30/buybacks-why-they-dont-matter-why-they-do-and-why-you-should-care-yet-still-relax/ No promise of a payout? There are share buybacks.  The company is willing to offer cash for your shares.  No fool of any type is needed to turn your shares into cash flows.Jon Seed, I don't know you very well, but you seem to have a very strange quirk of treating share buybacks very differently than dividends.  Why is it that you gave dividends a free pass to all your concerns but are so skeptical of share buybacks?  Dividends and share buybacks are both mechanisms for a company to deliver cash to shareholders (aka give a \"payout\" as you are concerned about). I will agree, a firm can always buy everyone out and take the company private. A buyout is a \"payout\" my last remaining shareholder will rationally accept.  Jon, I didn't say anything about buying everyone out (completely) and going private.  I talked about normal share buybacks where <100% of outstanding shares are bought by the company, specifically about the situation of one shareholder that you seem concerned about.  Share buybacks can go on for arbitrarily long amounts of time without completely buying everyone out and going private. I know. I just think we exhausted this conversation. For the record, though, I agree in the equivalence of buyback and dividends (I linked to my article earlier) and I'm sure John is as well. I also agree then can go on for \"arbitrarily long amounts of time\". I disagree that buybacks can go on forever. I tried to use the natural end point (one last remaining shareholder) to illustrate why a firm has to eventually make a \"payout\", but obviously I failed.  We can try one last time: why do you think that the situation of one shareholder and share buybacks can't go on forever?  A sole shareholder can receive cash flows from the company via share buybacks forever (much like dividends). It seems your mom has a hunch about non ergodicity.  \n\n\nComments are welcome.

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog We need to be reminded occasionally that nothing matters but long-run growth, and long-run growth all comes from productivity, better knowledge of how to better serve human needs and desires. \u00a0Yet economic policy is almost all not about growth, but rather about redistribution, and in particular propping up old ways of doing things and the rents associated with them.\u00a0 Courtesy Marginal Revolution, the Institute for Progress is a noteworthy new effort to produce growth-oriented policy. Institutions are important, to spread the word and create a constituency for tending the golden goose.\u00a0 ..productivity growth has been in long-term decline since the 1970s. This is supposed to be the age of ambitious infrastructure investments in the battle to fight climate change, but we can\u2019t even build new solar plants without being vetoed by conservation groups. Hyperloops and supersonic airplanes promise to revolutionize transportation, but building a simple subway extension in NYC costs up to 15 times more per kilometer than it does in other cities around the world. ...The pace of scientific progress has been slowing....\u00a0 (Here and elsewhere see the original for links.) Why?\u00a0 Over the last 50 years, we\u2019ve increased the number of veto points at nearly every governmental level, failed to invest in state capacity, and raised the stakes of the debate through polarization. So it perhaps shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that the federal government that went to the moon in 1969 botched production of simple diagnostic tests during a once-in-a-century pandemic. But the potential is there. Maybe we are not running out of ideas after all, but merely on the edge of technical revolutions, like changing from rail to airplanes: \u00a0 \u00a0  ...there are genuinely exciting \u2014 potentially game-changing \u2014 discoveries on the horizon.\u00a0  New biotech innovations...may finally deliver cures to some cancers, HIV, malaria, influenza, and EBV. New AI models are unfolding the secrets of the molecular world before our eyes. Electric vehicles are poised for a massive breakout. Commercial rocket launches are becoming such a regular occurrence that they hardly merit news coverage. And record investments are pouring into enhanced geothermal systems, advanced nuclear, and long-duration energy storage, which together could provide the globe with near-limitless clean energy capable of meeting baseload demand.  What to do?\u00a0 to do the most good in the world, prioritize issues that are important, neglected, and tractable. When it comes to public policy, that means working on issues that matter a lot, that have only a few individuals or groups working on them, and that are within the realm of political feasibility. Applying this framework to the U.S. context leads to the perhaps surprising conclusion that a lot of the topics that dominate the headlines are not actually the most valuable policies to be working on. I'll forgive them the electric cars which have no lack of highly visible boosters in the government, and soon, the Fed. But what are the big questions nobody is thinking about? Just asking the question is praiseworthy. Their answers:\u00a0 Metascience \u2013 How can we change the incentives within science to produce more breakthrough research? The U.S. federal government is the single largest source of science funding in the world. Despite how much we\u2019re spending, we know surprisingly little about how the structures, incentives, and organizational models within science impact the results we get. But there are signs that something has gone wrong. Principal investigators report spending 44% of their time doing grant-related paperwork and maintenance (as opposed to active research). The average age of a principal investigator working at the National Institutes of Health rose from 39 years old in 1980 to 51 years old in 2008.

The utter failure of NASA's heavy-lift relative to Space-X seems like useful caution. They suggest \"pull mechanisms,\" like prizes. But the deeper question is, why do agencies not use pull mechanisms.\u00a0  The share of US GDP for farming is 0.9 percent and all agriculture is ~5 percent. Iowa with the highest share is ~10 percent and more GDP comes from Iowa's research labs than ag. I do an occasional survey with students, colleagues, friends and family and every single one says the share of CA ag gdp is ~ 50 percent and that of Indiana is 60 percent etc. (2.5 & 5 percents respectively). There is no red or blue bias here! All are way off! So during the next primaries, instead of pandering to farmers in Iowa (only 900K independent farmers left in the US and Archer Daniels Midlands type ag companies run 70 percent of farms now), maybe our pols should says how valuable an H1B visa is and how incredibly lucky the US is that it can corner the market of innovative and productive people into its geographic sphere. And just ask any student applying for MIT if they would take up a job or raise a family in Beijing. China or even the US can never replicate the US of the late 20-early 21st century. But the US can maintain the market for innovation and productivity by continuing to do what is does right now i.e. attract global talent. Sclerosis. Does not look good. Of course the source of the problem is in interest groups and the bureaucracy. Or us! The Reagan revolution has been all but forgotten. Even something as fundamental as the Thatcher revolution in Britain soon petered out.A peaceful revolution has the best chance of starting and winning here.  'Total factor productivity' is not a meaningful metric.  If F(K,L) is the production function for the economy, total factor productivity is F(K,L)/(K)/(L) = A(K,L). Total factor productivity growth is dA(K,L)/A(K,L)dt = d(ln(A(K,L))/dt = d(ln(F(K,L)-ln(K)-ln(L))/dt.  Suppose F(K,L) = a K^b L^c, then dA(K,L)/A(K,L)dt =  da(t)/a(t)dt + (b-1)dK(t)/K(t)dt + (c-1)dL(t)/L(t)dt = g(t), in the most general case.  And,  K = K1 + K2 + ... + Kn + ..., and, L = L1 + L2 + ... + Ln + ... if K and L are linear combinations of Ki and Li, i = 1, 2, ... , n, ... . But, if capital Ki and Li are not separable, in this sense, then F(K,L) = F1(K1,L1) + F2(K2,L2) + ... etc., and for a society that produces intermediate and primary products in addition to final products, and uses inputs from overseas (imports factor inputs) in addition to domestic inputs, the interrelationships between capital and labor become difficult to untangle.  The automobile manufacturing industry is a case in point.  It is said that inputs of intermediate products that make up the final product will cross the Canada-US border several times before becoming integrated in the final product in the US. Disentangling the inputs into such intermediate products is difficult, and the \"total factor productivity\" for such factor inputs is consequently difficult to define.  The economist doesn't try to do so--she makes an estimate (a best guess, in most instances) and plugs a number into her spreadsheet model that then crunches the data and presto-magico out pops a number referred to as \"TFP\".  The production environment has become considerably more complex than ever it was in the 1970s.  In addition, much of the production is subcontracted overseas while the so-called \"high value-added\" work is performed domestically (without producing physical product, e.g., \"widgets\").  Most of the semiconductor chips are designed in \"fab-less\" design centers while the chips themselves are produced overseas in \"fabs\" (Taiwan Semi, etc.)  The drive is towards zero labor factor inputs onshore, and the transfer of capital intensive production to offshore centers where labor inputs are less expensive.  GDP is an imperfect measure in those cases.  GNP may capture more of total national output, but imperfectly as well.The control engineers would say, with some justification, \"If you can't measure it, you can't control it.\"  But, if you're going to measure it, you may as well understand what it is you are measuring because it could be the wrong measure, a.s.Suppose one could accurately measure \"TFP\", precisely.  Would that be a sufficient condition, or simply a necessary condition (perhaps one of many necessary conditions).  Suppose this new \"think tank\" staff thought it was a sufficient condition, when it was only a necessary condition, and then went ahead and published its findings and drew up a list of recommended societal changes (actions) based on those (incorrect) findings. What damage or mischief might come of out of that?  Enthusiasm is one thing (necessary, perhaps, but never sufficient), and \"Web 3.0\" is generating enthusiasm in some quarters, as an example, yet I can't help but think that there are too many \"big-picture thinkers\" these days, (too many chiefs) relative to worker bees. OEE,\"The control engineers would say, with some justification, If you can't measure it, you can't control it.  But, if you're going to measure it, you may as well understand what it is you are measuring because it could be the wrong measure, a.s.\"Absolutely.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity\"The word total suggests all inputs have been measured. Official statisticians tend to use the term multifactor productivity (MFP) instead of TFP because some inputs such as energy are usually not included.\"\"External costs including attributes of the workforce, public infrastructure such as highways and environmental sustainability costs such as mineral depletion and pollution are not traditionally included.\"\"On the basis of dimensional analysis, TFP has been criticized as lacking meaningful units of measurement.  The units of the quantities in the Cobb\u2013Douglas equation are:A: (widgets * year\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2013 1)/(caphr\u03b1 * manhr\u03b2), a balancing quantity, which is TFP\"In this construction the units of A would not have a simple economic interpretation, and the concept of TFP appear to be a modeling artifact.\"A \"better\" measure of productivity would simply be Real GDP / Total Credit Market Debt Outstanding.  The units are widgets per nominal dollar of debt and both Real GDP and total debt outstanding are measurable quantities.Further, regarding your control engineer notation, a government (in particular a Treasury) CAN regulate the amount of debt that it issues irregardless of the wishes of the Legislature. See John's opening statements above:\"We need to be reminded occasionally that nothing matters but long-run growth, and long-run growth all comes from productivity, better knowledge of how to better serve human needs and desires.\"Not exactly.Productivity is a ratio (similar to efficiency in mechanical / electrical systems).With either TFP or Real GDP / TCMDO, maximizing productivity does not in and of itself maximize real growth, in the same way that maximizing the mechanical / electrical efficiency of a system does not necessarily maximize the total output of that system.Productivity is important because improvements in productivity are non-rivalrous - meaning I don't need to compete with my neighbor for scarce real resources to improve the amount of output that I am generating using what is already available to me.See Non-Rivalrous goods:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)\"A good is considered non-rivalrous or non-rival if, for any level of production, the cost of providing it to a marginal (additional) individual is zero.  Economist Paul Samuelson made the distinction between private and public goods in 1954 by introducing the concept of nonrival consumption. Economist Richard Musgrave followed on and added rivalry and excludability as criteria for defining consumption goods in 1959 and 1969.\"Country A has an endowment of 1000 tons of iron ore uses that ore to produce 1000 motorized vehicles (1 car per ton).Country B has an endowment of 5000 tons of iron ore and uses that ore to produce 3000 equivalent motorized vehicles (0.6 cars per ton).Even though country B has produced more cars (more real output), country A has a more productive society (more output for a given level of input).Wars are started when countries focus on maximizing output (using goods obtained in conquest) rather than maximizing productivity. \"Productivity\" = output per unit of factor inputs.  If Y equals the output of a Cobb-Douglas production function, F(K,L; A, a, b) = A.K^a.L^b, A>0, a >0, b >0, then, total factor productivity is given by F/(K^a.L^b) = A.  Thus, \"total factor productivity\" equals the constant of proportionality, A.  This is a tautology, i.e., \"a statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form\" (Oxford Dictionary).\"Productivity growth\" is then (dA(t)/dt)/A(t) and this can be written in terms of factor inputs K and L. Hence, dA(t)/A(t) = dY(t)/Y(t) - a.dK(t)/K(t) - b.dL(t)/L(t), using the chain-rule of differentiation.  Productivity growth is non-dimensional.  Suppose the labor supply is growing at the rate of dL(t)/L(t) = n(t).  Further, suppose economic growth is given by g(t) = dY(t)/Y(t).  Then,       productivity growth is given by          dA(t)/A(t) = g(t) - b.n(t) - a.dK(t)/K(t).  Suppose dK(t) = -m.K(t).dt + Y(t).dt - C(t).dt, where C(t) is total consumption, all quantities expressed in units of the output commondity for consistency. Then,       productivity growth is  given by         dA(t)/A(t) = g(t) -b.n(t) - a.m + Y(t)/K(t) - C(t)/K(t). Let, y(t) = Y(t)/L(t), c(t) = Y(t)/L(t), and k(t) = K(t)/L(t).  Total factor productivity growth can be expressed as follows,        dA(t)/A(t) = g(t) -b.n(t) -a.m +[y(t) - c(t)].k(t)       (1)In words, {TFP growth} = {economic growth rate, g} minus [{share of labor, b} x {labor growth rate, n}] minus [{share of capital, a} x {capital depreciation rate, m}] + [{net capital investment per unit of labor, y - c} x {capital:labor ration, k}].Any estimation of TFP growth must include the specification of the production function assumed in constructing the regression model.Note, in the Cobb-Douglas production function specification, that TFP has units of the output commodity divided by the product of {units of capital}^a and {units of labor}^b, in order to be consistent with the assumed form of the production function.  The Wikipedia author's criticism is nonsensical.This simple model (incorrectly stated in my original comment posted above) belies the actual complexity of a modern open economy (exports and imports omitted), as noted in that comment.Because the definition of total factor productivity is a tautology, it is not uniquely defined, but depends on the mathematical model of the assumed production function. Labor productivity, per se, is only valid for a specific level of capital employed.  It is a universal metric but its usefulness is limited.  Likewise with capital productivity.The marginal product of capital is (r + m) on the optimal growth trajectory; likewise, the marginal product of labor is w on the optimal growth trajectory. Off the optimal growth trajectory, marginal products are lower (by definition)Determining which of Society A and Society B is \"more productive\" is more complicated than illustrated in your example.  Consider: A BMW Isetta uses less steel per vehicle than does a Suburban, but the Suburban can carry more cargo and passengers per trip-mile than an Isetta can. Which is the \"more productive\" depends on the nature of the product (passenger trip-miles per unit time per vehicle, for example).  It may be \"more productive\" for Society A and Society B to export their iron ore resources to Society C which has scale economies in the production of \"cars\", and import such mixes of \"cars\" as best suits their individual social welfare utility functions.  Simple statistics are rarely, if ever, conclusive in determining the winner of \"more productive\" comparisons. \"Determining which of Society A and Society B is more productive is more complicated than illustrated in your example. Consider: A BMW Isetta uses less steel per vehicle than does a Suburban, but the Suburban can carry more cargo and passengers per trip-mile than an Isetta can.\"I presume that in calculations of Real GDP (widgets), the Suburban counts as more widgets than does an Isetta via hedonic adjustment?See my orginal postulation - \"Country B has an endowment of 5000 tons of iron ore and uses that ore to produce 3000 EQUIVALENT motorized vehicles (0.6 cars per ton).\"My example was written to illustrate the point out that maximizing real economic growth (Real GDP) and maximizing productivity (ratio of Real GDP and inputs) are not the same thing.If Russia does invade the Ukraine and re-absorb it, Russian national Real GDP will likely rise (more workers, more resources, more output).  Net Russian productivity may not rise with it. If your example \"was written to illustrate the point out that maximizing real economic growth (Real GDP) and maximizing productivity (ratio of Real GDP and inputs) are not the same thing\", it didn't achieve that end.  To wit,Economic growth is dY(t)/Y(t)/dt.  Productivity is Y(t)/[K(t)^a L(t)^b]= A(t).  The former is the time rate of change of economic activity per unit of economic activity.  The latter is the ratio of economic activity to the factor inputs utilized to generate that activity (e.g., your example) at a specific instant in time.  The time rate of change of productivity, (i.e., productivity growth) dA(t)/A(t)/dt, is the quantity that is of interest to economists.  Suppose that in period t = 0, productivity is A(0) and output is Y(0) = F(K(0),L(0)) = A(0).[K(0)^a.L(0)^b], where, a + b = 1 (i.e., constant economies of scale).  Now, suppose that you have a brilliant idea on a means to improve productivity in period t = 1, and suppose you are correct and your idea is put to practice resulting in improved productivity, i.e., A(1) > A(0).  Suppose that capital, K, and labor, L, in period t =1 is unchanged from period t =0, i.e., K(1) = K(0), and L(1) = L(0).  What happens to output in period t = 1?  Output should increase, i.e., Y(1) > Y(0) in the ratio A(1)/A(0), ceteris paribus.  In this example, productivity growth, ln(A(1)) - ln(A(0)), to a first approximation, leads to output growth, ln(Y(1)) - ln(Y(0)), in equal measure, ceteris paribus.Suppose that your goal is not to increase output, but to reduce factor inputs.  How would you achieve that purpose?  Ans. -- reduce K, and L is proportion to the increase in A.  Note that the sum of the exponents is equal to 1, in the assumption at the beginning of this comment.  One such evolution, that achieves your goal, is given by Y(1) = Y(0), A(1) > A(0), K(1) < K(0), and L(1) < L(0) such that K(1)/K(0) = [A(0)/A(1)]^(1/a) and L(1)/L(0) = [A(0)/A(1)]^(1/b).  You might pursue that goal if your output with the productivity improvement exceeds the demand for your output in the goods or services marketplace in period t = 1, for example. Typically, though, the economists prefer to view productivity growth as a driver for societal welfare improvement, especially when net popuation growth is positive, whether by natural increase or a combination of natural increase and increase in net immigration. We need to be reminded that what matters most is equanimity, understanding at the experiential level the transient nature of existence \u2013 particles arising and passing away with great rapidity, nothing to cling to, no \u201cI, me, mine,\u201d giving us the ability to face every moment with a peaceful mind. My other comment not withstanding, I generally agree with your article.  About 30 years ago I surveyed a wide range of econometric studies on the optimal level of government for GDP growth: almost all studies found 22% optimal, none was far from that.  My experience as a government economic policy adviser in the UK and Australia suggests that governments are increasingly intrusive, and public servants increasingly obstructive.  The best governments here - under Hawke (ALP) and Howard (Liberal)- had ministers with wide experience of life, an openness to ideas and a genuine interest in public welfare.  Now we have mainly careerists.  The situation in many/most Australian universities is also dire, with woke left-wing ideas dominant. Michael,\"The best governments here - under Hawke (ALP) and Howard (Liberal)- had ministers with wide experience of life, an openness to ideas and a genuine interest in public welfare.\"Is our education system designed to provide that \"wide experience of life\" or has it become a toxic mix of specialization and career advancement through affiliation (political party, race, sexual orientation, or other)? Current Wealth comes being FIRST in line for the WAVE of CASH being printed! Democrats are currently showering THEIR STATES with Trillions.It is sad seeing the veritable financial Rape of the next generation. Every Child Born Today has $100,000 of Federal DEBT. We are Rapidly copying the centrally planned and centrally controlled economy of the USSR.Want to get rich be the son or daughter of Biden and Pelosi et al...where they MAKE millions for the simple action of being the child of an Important Democrat who can arrange meetings.Wall Street barely functions to create real jobs...just gamble on High Speed Financial Speculation of Speculation with a FED that offers Unlimited Backing of Speculation for the \"right groups\"! Or do a renewable tax credit FLIP deal...so a Fortune 500 company can pay ZERO income Tax on multi-billion dollar profits! John,\"Political Economy. How can we reform the US regulatory and administrative state to remove all those veto points, roadblocks, and stifling red tape?\"To reduce the veto points you simply shift to an autocracy (king / queen) instead of the representative Democracy that we live under today.That way when the king / queen decides to try, convict, and imprison you for no good reason, there won't be anyone to veto his / her decision.

We have the most educated laborforce in history, and the availability of labor worldwide; we are not utilizing a resource that is right before us.We are more of a service sector economy now so maybe we need to reorganize our business structures -- maybe try going back to hierarchical organizations with an international/national reach -- and also expand the tech capabilities in the service sectors. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=LbN7This measure of productivity is a farce.If government pays people not to work then hours worked fall and productivity \"improves\" through fewer hours worked.  Inflation rises because income increases while real output stagnates.I mean hell, if increasing output PER hour is the secret sauce to improving national productivity, then just pay people to sit at home doing nothing and import everything.Hours worked falls to zero and productivity shoots off to infinity. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

The Fed has scandalously blocked narrow-banking enterprises and payments providers that could help serve many Americans\u2019 financial needs.\u00a0 Before turning to healing the planet and righting injustice, the Fed should be held to account for how badly it is doing on the basic task of protecting the financial system.  \u00a0 Why is price stability the Fed's main mandate? Certainly it's an important but so is managing unemployment.  If the Fed wants to get into social engineering, I propose the Fed outlaw banking in those states that do not outlaw property zoning.The cost of housing in America is ruinous, and it stems in large part from property zoning and scarce supply. I beg to differ. Housing costs have skyrocketed because of the cost of building a house (replacement costs)When the cost of a permit to replace a wall heater is greater than the cost of the heater, this rather basic event indicates how building regulations and codes are out of control and consequently raise the price of building a new house.There's plenty of land so zoning is not an issue. The cost of developing the land due to government regulations is the problem Sure, many regs make a mess, but in some cities, such as L.A., 70% of land is zoned single-family detached. What the West Coast needs is forests of 60-story condo towers, right where people want to live. You can build 60-story condo tower outside Palmdale. There is plenty of land.  Mr. Cole, you vastly overestimate the attractiveness of living in one of a \"forest\" of 60-story condo towers.  Not everyone is single without children and looking for a cave to hide in. It's not just the zoning - in many cities with highest home price appreciation water and sewer capacity is very limited.  This capacity is very expensive and cannot be added in small increments - and many of those cities are in such dire financial straits it would be very challenging economically and politically to sell bonds to pay for services for new development. The Fed is not, should not, and cannot be responsible for local zoning laws or failure to upgrade local infrastructure. California has ample tax income to fund any and all necessary infrastructure; it simply chooses not to fund it. As for Fed policy, debt reduces flexibility. Massive debt eliminates flexibility. As John states, humans and human institutions, including the Fed, are not clairvoyant. So building fragile structures is a failed strategy. Will we ever learn? No, probably not. In the USA, political expediency reigns supreme. Weimar, here we come.   \"... the Fed should be held to account for how badly it is doing on the basic task of protecting the financial system.\"  While I am sympathetic to the general thrust of this essay, I have to conclude with the observation that the Scotch verdict \"Not proved\" applies in this case. The Federal Reserve itself says there are 4 major areas of responsibility, none of which is to influence climate change or social policies. The first is: \"Conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of full employment and stable prices.\"I am archiving their current FAQ for posterity because in the future, their stated mission likely will include climate change and social policies.  Great column. One question: the left wants more regulation, but the answer is more capital. Touche. What does the right want? sadly the richest don't get tired of wealth accumulation unlike times past where people like Carnegie, Rockefeller, etc actually built business...then set about helping others. Henry Ford paid his employees to make sure they could afford his car.Today's wall street...the recipient of MORE THAN $9 trillion of FED Lagress...is unlimitedly glutenous with a raw hatred of most of America and actually little interest in business and its success! Government today isn't to help people and businesses...it is to enrich select cronies and itself using unlimited power and DEBT! Sadly I believe the next downturn with be a once in 100 year Event! -->\"Henry Ford paid his employees to make sure they could afford his car.\"Sorry to say, but that's an apocryphal story. Ford had 100% daily labor turnover at the pay rate originally offered. He had to raise pay for the extremely boring assembly line work. Ford paid his employees to stop quitting. The end result was they could afford to buy his car.The last three downturns were 100 year events (as measured relying on Gaussian statistics)--no reason the next downturn won't be. Cheers. The difficulty for the Fed going forward in an environment of higher inflation, higher interest rates, and probably higher growth rates, is the balancing act it will have to do between tapping the breaks on our domestic economy if inflation rates climb versus the financial funding accommodation the international markets will need to keep functioning.  Don\u2019t forget that before the pandemic hit, in the Autumn of 2019, our Fed had to intervene when the financial intermediaries (banks) could not meet the run for cash/cash equivalents.  With actors pulling at both ends of the monetary policy rope for tightening and loosening, the Fed will have a delicate tap dance satisfying its impetuous players. Currently inflation is the illness. Interest rates the castor oil. Any delay taking the medicine prolongs the illness. Worry about other things when circumstances improve. The Fed getting into areas where they have no business scares the bejeebers out of me. Perhaps they are moving into these areas because they can't cover their main task (price stability) and want to feel good about themselves? Pitiful.Plain manila Taylor rules put current interest rate targets over 8 percent. Not surprised we have inflation when interest rates are purposefully held so much lower than required.Pete Bias Anonymous / Pete Bias,8% interest rates x $28.43 trillion in federal debt = $2.27 trillion in interest payments on that debt.  Federal receipts:https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W006RC1Q027SBEA3rd Qtr - 2021 - $2.51 trillion\"Plain manila Taylor rules put current interest rate targets over 8 percent.\"Taylor could never be bothered to include the quantity of federal debt or how debt reduction should be achieved in his \"rule\".

In 2020, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The Fed established broad-based lending programs to prevent businesses that were otherwise sound from failing due to the shutdowns.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Writing in the New York Times in May 2020,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ms. Raskin wanted the Fed to exclude fossil-fuel companies from these facilities. \u201cThe Fed is ignoring clear warning signs about the economic repercussions of the impending climate crisis by taking action that will lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions at a time when even in the short term, fossil fuels are a terrible investment,\u201d she wrote. ...</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe Fed\u2019s unique independence affords it a powerful role,\u201d Ms. Raskin added. \u201cThe decisions the Fed makes on our behalf should build toward a stronger economy with more jobs in innovative industries\u2014not prop up and enrich dying ones.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><span></span></p><a name=\"more\"></a>Writing for <a href=\"https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2020-06/Financial%20Regulators%20FULL%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ceres</a>, &nbsp;<p></p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe must rebuild with an economy where the values of sustainability are explicitly embedded in market valuation,\u201d she wrote. This will require \u201cour financial regulatory bodies to do all they can\u2014which turns out to be a lot\u2014to bring about the adoption of practices and policies that will <i>allocate capital and align portfolios </i>toward sustainable investments that do not depend on carbon and fossil fuels.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>My emphasis. The report also&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>suggests the Fed use the \u201ccommunity reinvestment process to bolster the resilience of low-income communities to climate change.\u201d&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is wonderful. For the last year that I have been following the issue, it has all been clouded in what I regard as deceitful misinformation -- Oh, we're not trying to regulate <i>climate policy</i>. That's beyond our mandate. We just look around at risks to the financial system and lo and behold we find that climate poses an important risk to the financial system. So we're just doing our job as dispassionate financial regulators. The idea of climate risk to the financial system is, in my view (and my reading of the scientific literature) so farcical that I called this out as a subterfuge. But there the argument lay.&nbsp;</p><p>No more. Thank you Ms. Raskin for stating the truth so clearly. Now we're ready to put that nonsense smokescreen aside and have an honest debate. Should the Fed get involved in allocating capital in order to pursue climate policies? Especially to go beyond what Congress, Administration, and EPA are willing to do, for fear of wrathful voters?&nbsp;</p><p>Ms. Raskin is superbly qualified and experienced. If you don't like these policy preferences, that makes her more dangerous as she has the knowledge and skill to implement them. &nbsp;That's great too -- the discussion can't get derailed over qualifications.&nbsp;</p><p>********</p><p>A few journalists approached me to ask about Professor Cook's qualifications. Since they had an obvious agenda, I did not comment. But it is a line of argument you will hear.&nbsp;</p><p>My answer is simple: It depends what the job is. Just spend some time on <a href=\"https://lisadcook.net\" target=\"_blank\">her website</a>. Read her <a href=\"https://lisadcook.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Revised-CV-PDF-Edits-0521.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CV</a>. Cook is an academic, so her main qualification is her writing, not business or other experience which some other Fed board members bring.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, in her extensive writing for academic journals and think tank essays listed under \"publications,\" you will find essentially nothing related to monetary policy, monetary effects on employment, interest rates, inflation, financial regulation or other traditional Fed topics. (Maybe her <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations\" target=\"_blank\">most cited paper</a> \u201cTrade Credit and Bank Finance: Financing Small Firms in Russia,\u201d Journal of Business Venturing, 1999 counts, but on the conventional basis it's a slim basis to sit at the Fed.)0</p><p>But, to keep a blog post short, just read a selected few of the most recent publications:&nbsp;</p><p></p><blockquote><p>\u2022 \u201cCan addressing inequality unleash economic growth?\u201d (with Nela Richardson and Jim Tankersley) Business Economics 56, 5966, (2021).</p><p>\u2022 \u201cAddressing gender and racial disparities in the U.S. labor market to boost wages and power innovation,\u201d Washington Center for Equitable Growth, January 14, 2021.</p><p>\u2022 \u201cPolicies to broaden participation in the innovation process,\u201d Brookings Institution, The Hamilton Project, August 14, 2020.</p><p>\u2022 \u201cGetting money urgently to low-wage U.S. workers,\u201d Washington Center for Equitable Growth, March 30, 2020.</p><p>\u2022 \u201cThe implications of U.S. gender and racial disparities in income and wealth inequality at each stage of the innovation process,\u201d (with Jan Gerson) Washington Center for Equitable Growth Policy Brief, July 2019.</p><p>\u2022 \u201cRural Segregation and Racial Violence: Historical Effects of Spatial Racism,\u201d with Trevon Logan and John Parman, American Journal of Economics and Sociology Volume 1, Numbers 3 and 4, (2018).</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>\u2022 \u201cRacial Segregation and Southern Lynching\u201d, with Trevon Logan and John Parman, Social Science History, vol 42 (4), pages 635-675, (2018).</p></blockquote><p>It goes on like this. Her <a href=\"https://lisadcook.net/bio-cv/\" target=\"_blank\">bio</a> lists a bewildering number of institutional affiliations:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>She is currently Director of the American Economic Association Summer Program and was President of the National Economic Association from 2015 to 2016. In 2019, she was awarded the Impactful Mentor Award (for mentoring graduate students) by the American Economic Association Mentoring Pipeline Program and was elected to the Executive Committee of the American Economic Association. During the 2011-2012 academic year, she was on leave at the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama and has had visiting appointments at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the University of Michigan, and the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. She serves on the Advisory Boards of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (Academic Advisory Council), the National Science Foundation (Social and Behavioral Sciences), the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and the Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation of the Smithsonian Institution. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>(My only complaint: Her <a href=\"https://lisadcook.net\" target=\"_blank\">bio </a>lists her has having been \"a National Fellow at Stanford University.\" No, she was a National Fellow at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. Which signed the checks. Her CV lists it correctly. I'm only sensitive because people accuse Hoover of being right-wing, and here is contrary proof.)&nbsp;</p><p>She is currently a member of <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/leadership/officers\" target=\"_blank\">American Economic Association Executive Committee</a>&nbsp;(She does more than she even can keep up with on her CV and bio!), and serves on the<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/csmgep/members/lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\"> Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession of the American Economic Association</a>, which is conducting an expansive <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/best-practices\" target=\"_blank\">\"diversity\" initiative</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I answer the question, Lisa Cook is superbly qualified, by written word, experience, and connections -- if the job is to bring the Administration and progressive supporters' racial policies to the Fed. That might mean requiring DEI or ESG practices at banks, or to companies that banks lend to, directing credit to some areas or by race, and strengthening the DEI initiatives and race based hiring and promotion practices within the Fed.&nbsp;</p><p>Should the Fed be doing that? Again, thanks Mr. President, we can now have a straightforward discussion.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

In 2020, \u00a0\u00a0 The Fed established broad-based lending programs to prevent businesses that were otherwise sound from failing due to the shutdowns.\u00a0 Writing in the New York Times in May 2020,\u00a0 Ms. Raskin wanted the Fed to exclude fossil-fuel companies from these facilities. \u201cThe Fed is ignoring clear warning signs about the economic repercussions of the impending climate crisis by taking action that will lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions at a time when even in the short term, fossil fuels are a terrible investment,\u201d she wrote. ... \u201cThe Fed\u2019s unique independence affords it a powerful role,\u201d Ms. Raskin added. \u201cThe decisions the Fed makes on our behalf should build toward a stronger economy with more jobs in innovative industries\u2014not prop up and enrich dying ones.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cWe must rebuild with an economy where the values of sustainability are explicitly embedded in market valuation,\u201d she wrote. This will require \u201cour financial regulatory bodies to do all they can\u2014which turns out to be a lot\u2014to bring about the adoption of practices and policies that will allocate capital and align portfolios toward sustainable investments that do not depend on carbon and fossil fuels.\u201d My emphasis. The report also\u00a0 suggests the Fed use the \u201ccommunity reinvestment process to bolster the resilience of low-income communities to climate change.\u201d\u00a0 This is wonderful. For the last year that I have been following the issue, it has all been clouded in what I regard as deceitful misinformation -- Oh, we're not trying to regulate climate policy. That's beyond our mandate. We just look around at risks to the financial system and lo and behold we find that climate poses an important risk to the financial system. So we're just doing our job as dispassionate financial regulators. The idea of climate risk to the financial system is, in my view (and my reading of the scientific literature) so farcical that I called this out as a subterfuge. But there the argument lay.\u00a0 No more. Thank you Ms. Raskin for stating the truth so clearly. Now we're ready to put that nonsense smokescreen aside and have an honest debate. Should the Fed get involved in allocating capital in order to pursue climate policies? Especially to go beyond what Congress, Administration, and EPA are willing to do, for fear of wrathful voters?\u00a0 Ms. Raskin is superbly qualified and experienced. If you don't like these policy preferences, that makes her more dangerous as she has the knowledge and skill to implement them. \u00a0That's great too -- the discussion can't get derailed over qualifications.\u00a0 ******** A few journalists approached me to ask about Professor Cook's qualifications. Since they had an obvious agenda, I did not comment. But it is a line of argument you will hear.\u00a0 My answer is simple: It depends what the job is. Just spend some time on her website. Read her CV. Cook is an academic, so her main qualification is her writing, not business or other experience which some other Fed board members bring.\u00a0 Indeed, in her extensive writing for academic journals and think tank essays listed under \"publications,\" you will find essentially nothing related to monetary policy, monetary effects on employment, interest rates, inflation, financial regulation or other traditional Fed topics. (Maybe her most cited paper \u201cTrade Credit and Bank Finance: Financing Small Firms in Russia,\u201d Journal of Business Venturing, 1999 counts, but on the conventional basis it's a slim basis to sit at the Fed.)0 But, to keep a blog post short, just read a selected few of the most recent publications:\u00a0  \u2022 \u201cCan addressing inequality unleash economic growth?\u201d (with Nela Richardson and Jim Tankersley) Business Economics 56, 5966, (2021). \u2022 \u201cAddressing gender and racial disparities in the U.S. labor market to boost wages and power innovation,\u201d Washington Center for Equitable Growth, January 14, 2021. \u2022 \u201cPolicies to broaden participation in the innovation process,\u201d Brookings Institution, The Hamilton Project, August 14, 2020. \u2022 \u201cGetting money urgently to low-wage U.S. workers,\u201d Washington Center for Equitable Growth, March 30, 2020. \u2022 \u201cThe implications of U.S. gender and racial disparities in income and wealth inequality at each stage of the innovation process,\u201d (with Jan Gerson) Washington Center for Equitable Growth Policy Brief, July 2019. \u2022 \u201cRural Segregation and Racial Violence: Historical Effects of Spatial Racism,\u201d with Trevon Logan and John Parman, American Journal of Economics and Sociology Volume 1, Numbers 3 and 4, (2018).  \u2022 \u201cRacial Segregation and Southern Lynching\u201d, with Trevon Logan and John Parman, Social Science History, vol 42 (4), pages 635-675, (2018). It goes on like this. Her bio lists a bewildering number of institutional affiliations:\u00a0 She is currently Director of the American Economic Association Summer Program and was President of the National Economic Association from 2015 to 2016. In 2019, she was awarded the Impactful Mentor Award (for mentoring graduate students) by the American Economic Association Mentoring Pipeline Program and was elected to the Executive Committee of the American Economic Association. During the 2011-2012 academic year, she was on leave at the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama and has had visiting appointments at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the University of Michigan, and the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. She serves on the Advisory Boards of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (Academic Advisory Council), the National Science Foundation (Social and Behavioral Sciences), the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and the Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation of the Smithsonian Institution. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.\u00a0 (My only complaint: Her bio lists her has having been \"a National Fellow at Stanford University.\" No, she was a National Fellow at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. Which signed the checks. Her CV lists it correctly. I'm only sensitive because people accuse Hoover of being right-wing, and here is contrary proof.)\u00a0 She is currently a member of American Economic Association Executive Committee\u00a0(She does more than she even can keep up with on her CV and bio!), and serves on the Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession of the American Economic Association, which is conducting an expansive \"diversity\" initiative.\u00a0 So, I answer the question, Lisa Cook is superbly qualified, by written word, experience, and connections -- if the job is to bring the Administration and progressive supporters' racial policies to the Fed. That might mean requiring DEI or ESG practices at banks, or to companies that banks lend to, directing credit to some areas or by race, and strengthening the DEI initiatives and race based hiring and promotion practices within the Fed.\u00a0 Should the Fed be doing that? Again, thanks Mr. President, we can now have a straightforward discussion.\u00a0    Thanks for your excellent summary. These people are not our best and brightest. Thanks for your excellent summary. These people are not our best and brightest. I give John credit for tight walking through a nasty minefield. Because any disagreement, even in the mildest form, could be misconstrued. Perhaps that's the point.I will be less artful. One can and should question the motivations behind these specific choices without it impugning women, women of color, or their qualifications in the field of economics. I'll go ahead and say it more cleanly. This smells of virtue signaling in the worst way. As a former FRBNY officer, some thoughts:1. Classically, the horizon for climate change would normally allow the repricing of contracts to reflect the risk (absent some very tail probability like the collapse of the ice shelf and the reversal of the Gulf Stream.2. Climate change is a classic externality, one that is global in scope.  The collective governments have agreed to address by committing to carbon reduction goals.3. In the best of all worlds, this would be done transparently through legislation.4. We all know that we do not live in such a world.5. By nominating Raskin, I don't think you can say it is \"beyond what the Administration is willing to do.\"6. I would prefer to directly raise the cost of carbon (either through exchanges or taxes), but this may be a 'next best' solution.7.  Do not let the best be the enemy of the good.8. Prepare for the 2nd order consequences of this action. I think the natural retort would be:This feels like a overreach of the feds stated powers. The whole reason the Fed avoids checks and balances of traditional government is because it has a limited and transparent scope of power. The FED is also supposed to be apolitical, but it sure doesn't feel that way. Politics and economics go together like peanut butter and jelly, but often don't have the same taste every time. There's no escaping or separating these two critical functions of society. To me this isn't about the Fed picking winners or losers per se. It's inevitable there's toe smashing in the attempt to have the illusion of stability, with as little variation as possible. Utopia, yes? This comment has been removed by the author. Your critique of Dr. Cook needs some work. First you say her record is too thin - and then you say she's doing too much and that you're bewildered by how much she's doing. So, which is it? You cherry picked her research to avoid mentioning all she's done that is clearly in line with the Fed's mandate. Do you think Milton Friedman made a mistake by backing her research? Or, did that fact not fit with your fairy tale. I can't find anything she's written about mandating DEI and ESG at banks. Your implication that her work \"might mean\" she supports those things is utterly silly. As for this notion you led with that some journalists called you and asked for your views on Dr. Cook - well, why not name them? What an odd and truly weird hack job. May your feet never touch the ground, John.  John obviously struck a nerve...  I have a lot of complaints about the Fed; usually its been too tight.The Fed has a thousand economists, but there is never a clear discussion of whether a larger balance sheet is inflationary, or actually anti-inflationary in that it increases investor confidence in the federal government ability to meet debts.I might even wonder if it is better to create money through money-financed fiscal programs, rather than through greater government borrowing or more commercial bank lending.And yet even I think these three choices for the Federal Reserve board are absolutely crummy, for the reasons suggested in this excellent blog. Hell, it's the commanding heights! Been there, done that.May the Lord have mercy on our souls. What is Spacial Racism ?  Is it discrimination against Martians ?  The Fed doesn't do well what it should be doing.  Can we  hope that it will do at least as well what it shouldn't be doing?  Hi Dr. Cochrane - I hope all is well.  I had your Investments course at the GSB in '97 (or '98?).  It was a great class.  I wanted to ask about the comment, above, \"The idea of climate risk to the financial system is, in my view...farcical\".  I know it's certainly the case that climate change can affect companies and industries so I wanted to ask, what are the criteria for something to have a material, adverse risk to the stability of the whole system.  Is it the potential for some x% change in liquidity or prices across the U.S. market (that quickly \"infects\" world markets), or the world market in general, that persists for a certain time?  How quickly does it have to happen?  As an example, would it have to be something like the crisis in 2008 but that was precipitated by a climate disaster?  It would be helpful to get a sense for what the magnitudes would have to be for people to agree it was due to \"climate change\" (whether that's a mega-disaster or series of disasters or some quantifiable trend).Thanks, Matt   Click on the energy or environment links. I went on and on over the last few months on the topic of climate financial risks. On its own, this is too brusque a sentence, you are right, but there is a lot behind it.  Thanks - I'll check it out. (This was my first foray to the Grumpy Economist blog!) \"The idea of climate risk to the financial system is, in my view (and my reading of the scientific literature) so farcical that I called this out as a subterfuge.\" You are a theoretical economist, I wouldn't expect you to understand the scientific literature of climate change well enough to derive its risk to financial system (which also requires empirical grounding, something you seem to lack).  I do have one addition here. The FT, as no doubt others, notes the critical lack of banks in minority communities. The Chicago Fed has fsimilar finding in its study of Detroit. Without banking services and loans, local business in minority communities find it difficult to scale their businesses and build wealth. At the time I read this the Chicago Fed asked for local community representatives to serve on an advisory board. I immediately thought of the North Lawndale community which is in partnership with Old St Pat's RC church. Speaking with Rodney Brown, a top official in North Lawndale's comprehensive community organization, they even have a Chamber of Commerce and a banking committee, I learn that North Lawndale just got its first bank in 20 years! Wintrust located in the neighborhood this past April. For these  reasons, as well as others, Lisa Cook brings an important perspective to the Fed - that of ample financial services in minority communities to support local businesses, hence growth and wealth building. \"...thinktank essays listed under publications\" lol. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

(Mechanically, the Treasury issued $3 trillion of new debt, which the Fed quickly bought in return for $3 trillion of new reserves. The Treasury sent out checks, transferring the reserves to people\u2019s banks. See Table 1.) &nbsp;The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so, and sent more checks. Overall federal debt rose nearly 30 percent. Is it at all a surprise that a year later inflation breaks out? &nbsp;It is hard to ask for a clearer demonstration of fiscal inflation, an immense fiscal helicopter drop, exhibit A for the fiscal theory of the price level (Cochrane 2022a, 2022b). &nbsp;</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgdmCeNx46KottVgXGPrYA9B5SnObNXp8knXHaZTW6wDW7Lo0h9yuwRTFvFJ3KspEKRNRIWoXI777jnUICWU10h47lWefPtfn9Oh-Mta-Esxuoh_Bl-YndGLbPZZC17Kz4Uu_0XIdlnEIvAJ3LFRiG9s8cinkibXvqWPrL2wK9LFFnvWMPDtc8tflg=s1744\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgdmCeNx46KottVgXGPrYA9B5SnObNXp8knXHaZTW6wDW7Lo0h9yuwRTFvFJ3KspEKRNRIWoXI777jnUICWU10h47lWefPtfn9Oh-Mta-Esxuoh_Bl-YndGLbPZZC17Kz4Uu_0XIdlnEIvAJ3LFRiG9s8cinkibXvqWPrL2wK9LFFnvWMPDtc8tflg=w640-h285\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><p><b>What Dropped from the Helicopter?&nbsp;</b></p><p>From December 2019 to September 2021, the M2 money stock also increased by $5.6 trillion. &nbsp;This looks like a monetary, not a fiscal intervention, Milton Friedman\u2019s (1969) classic tale that if you want inflation, drop money from helicopters. But is it monetary or fiscal policy? Ask yourself: Suppose the expansion of M2 had been entirely financed by purchasing Treasury securities. Imagine Treasury debt had declined $5 trillion while M2 and reserves rose $5 trillion. Imagine that there had been no deficit at all, or even a surplus during this period. The monetary theory of inflation, MV=PY, states that we would see the same inflation. Really? <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Similarly, ask yourself: Suppose that the Federal Reserve had refused to go along. Suppose that the Treasury had sent people Treasury bills directly, accounts at Treasury.gov, along with directions how to sell them if people wished to do so. Better, suppose that the Treasury had created new mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and sent people mutual fund shares. (I write mutual fund as money market funds are counted in M2.) The monetary theory of inflation says again that this would have had no effect. These would be a debt issue, causing no inflation, not a monetary expansion. Really?&nbsp;<span></span></p><a name=\"more\"></a><p></p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Clearly, overall debt matters, not the split of government debt between interest-paying reserves or monetary base and Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve itself is nothing more than an immense money-market fund, offering shares that are pegged at $1 each, pay interest, and are backed by a portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. (Plus, an army of regulators and a huge staff of economists who are supposed to help forecast inflation.)&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Milton Friedman\u2019s (1969) helicopter drop is a powerful parable. But a helicopter drop is a fiscal policy, not a monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve may not legally drop money from helicopters; it may not write checks to voters. The Fed may even less vacuum up money; it may not tax people. Helicopter drops and money vacuums are fiscal operations. The Fed may only lend money, or buy and sell assets. To accomplish a helicopter drop in the United States, the Treasury must issue debt, the Fed must buy it with newly printed money, and then the Treasury must drop that money from helicopters, writing it down as a transfer payment. And that is pretty much exactly what happened.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Ask yourself: If, as Friedman\u2019s helicopter is dropping $1,000 on each household, the Fed sends burglars who remove $1,000 of Treasury securities from the same households, would we still see inflation? That\u2019s monetary policy. If Friedman\u2019s helicopter were followed by the Treasury secretary with a bullhorn, shouting \u201cEnjoy your $1,000 in helicopter money. Taxes are going up $1,000 tomorrow,\u201d would we still see inflation?&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Friedman\u2019s helicopters are not a monetary change, a substitution of money for debt, an increase in the liquidity of a given set of household assets. They are a \u201cwealth effect\u201d of government debt. Dropping debt from helicopters is a brilliant psychological device for convincing people that the government debt raining down on them will not be repaid by future taxes or spending restraint. It will be left outstanding, so they had better spend it now.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, we just witnessed a \u201chelicopter drop.\u201d But a helicopter drop is fiscal policy.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Why did fiscal inflation not happen sooner? The government has been borrowing money like the proverbial drunken sailor, for decades. The Fed has been buying Treasury securities and turning the debt into reserves for a decade. Why now?</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Inflation comes when government debt increases, relative to people\u2019s expectations of what the government will repay. If the Treasury borrows, but everyone understands it will later raise tax revenues or cut spending to repay the debt, that debt does not cause inflation. It is a good investment, and people are happy to hold on to it. If the Fed prints up a lot of money, buys Treasury debt, and the Treasury hands out the money, as happened, but everyone understands the Treasury will pay back the debt with future surpluses, the extra money causes no inflation. The Fed can always soak up the money by selling its Treasury securities, and the Treasury repays those securities with surpluses (i.e., taxes less spending).&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>The 2020\u20132021 borrowing and money episode was distinctive because, evidently, it came without a corresponding increase in expectations that the government would, someday, raise surpluses by $5 trillion in present value to repay the debt. &nbsp;Looking in to people\u2019s heads is hard, but why? We can at least find some plausible speculations.&nbsp;</p><p>One may look to politicians\u2019 statements. Even in the Obama-era \u201cstimulus\u201d spending, the administration emphasized promises of eventual debt reduction. One may chuckle and sneer at promises to repay debts decades after an administration leaves office, but at least they went through the motions to make that promise! Nobody went through any motions about long-run fiscal planning, long-run deficit reduction, and entitlement and tax reform, in 2020\u20132021. &nbsp;It was the era of modern monetary theory (MMT), of costless \u201cfiscal expansion\u201d made possible, or so it was claimed, by the manna-from-heaven that interest rates would stay low forever.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>The manner of fiscal expansion matters too. When the Treasury borrows in the usual manner, it borrows from established long-term investors, who view Treasury debt as debt that will be repaid and not defaulted or inflated. They view it as a savings or investment vehicle, not as cash to be spent. They save, or invest, based on long and so-far mostly successful experience. This time, following canary-in-the-coal mine disruptions in Treasury markets during March 2020, the Federal Reserve immediately bought new Treasury debt with newly created money, before it even touched these investor\u2019s portfolios. The effect of the operation was to print new money and send people checks, so the debt issue is now held as bank deposits flowing into reserves, rather than as Treasury securities. People holding this new money are likely to spend it rather than regard it as a long-term investment. &nbsp;In our simplest economic models, it does not matter who holds the debt. But in just a little more nuanced view, who holds the debt matters.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>In our simplest economic models, interest-paying reserves and Treasuries are equivalent securities. But people likely do see a difference between reserves and short-run Treasuries. Treasuries may well carry a reputation that they will be repaid, while people assume reserves will not be repaid by larger surpluses. Then issuing lots of reserves rather than Treasuries is inflationary, but not because the reserves are ``money,\u2019\u2019 but rather because they convey a different set of fiscal expectations, just as dropping money or debt from helicopters sends a different signal about repayment than issuing debt at a Treasury auction.</p><p>Most of the previous operations financed government spending or government worker salaries, counting on higher incomes to slowly filter through the economy. This one sent checks directly to people. &nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Finally, this fiscal stimulus was enormous, and carried out on a deep misdiagnosis of the state of the economy. Even in simplistic hydraulic Keynesian terms, $5 trillion times any multiplier is much larger than any plausible GDP gap. And the Covid recession was not due to a demand deficiency in the first place. A pandemic is, to the economy, like a huge snowstorm. Sending people money will not get them to go out to closed bars, restaurants, airlines, and businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cStimulus,\u201d \u201caccommodation,\u201d \u201ceasing\u201d was the point. This method finally worked, where previous stimulus efforts failed. One can see several suggestive differences, which amount to important economic lessons.</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>What about \u201csupply shocks?\u201d What about a shift of demand from services to durables? Much analysis misses the difference between relative prices and inflation, in which all prices and wages rise together. A supply shock makes one good more expensive than others. Only demand makes all goods rise together. There wouldn\u2019t be \u201csupply chain\u201d problems if people were not trying to buy things like mad! A shift in demand from services to durables can make durable prices go up. But it would make services prices go down. And let us not even go down the ridiculous path of blaming inflation on a sudden contagious outbreak of \u201cgreed\u201d and \u201ccollusion\u201d by businesses from oil companies to turkey farmers, needing the administration to send the FTC out to investigate.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>It is telling that inflation was a complete surprise to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve\u2019s job is supposed to be to monitor the supply capacity of the economy and to make sure demand does not outstrip it. &nbsp;The Fed failed twice. First, the economy did not need demand-side stimulus. Insurance was wise, and forestalling a financial crisis was necessary. But sending money to every citizen to stoke demand was not. Second, the Fed being surprised by supply shocks is as excusable as the Army losing a battle because its leaders are surprised that the enemy might attack. &nbsp;As we see by the outcome, the Fed\u2019s understanding of supply, largely based on statistical analysis of labor markets, is rudimentary.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp; WilI Inflation Continue?&nbsp;</b></p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>If the government borrows or prints $5 trillion, with no change in its plan to repay debt, on top of $17 trillion outstanding debt, then the price level will rise a cumulative 30 percent, so that the $22 trillion of debt is worth in real terms what the $17 trillion was before. In essence, absent a credible increase in future surpluses, the deficit is financed by defaulting on $5 trillion of outstanding debt, via inflation. By this calculation, the 6 percent or so cumulative inflation we have seen so far leaves a way to go. &nbsp;But people may think some of the debt will be repaid. If they think half will eventually be repaid, then the price level need only rise 15 percent overall.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>But then it stops. A one-time unbacked debt increase leads to a one-time price-level increase, not continuing inflation. Whether inflation continues or not depends on future &nbsp;monetary policy, future fiscal policy, and whether people change their minds about overall debt repayment. &nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Fiscal policy may not be done with us yet. If unbacked fiscal expansions continue\u2014that is, borrowing when people do not expect additional repayment\u2014then additional bouts of fiscal inflation will occur. Untold trillions of spending, including new entitlements, with no realistic hope of raising tax revenues commensurately to cover them are certainly high on the Biden administration\u2019s agenda. (Higher tax rates do not necessarily mean higher revenues, if economic growth falters; and even so the proposed taxes do not cover the proposed spending increases even with static scoring.) The mentality that borrowed money need never be repaid, because the MMT fairy or r&lt;g magic makes debt free, remains strong in Washington. &nbsp;But the failure of the so-called \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan may augur well for budget seriousness and a limit to ill-constructed social policies with strong supply disincentives.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>The most troublesome question remains: Do people, having decided that at least some of our government\u2019s new debt will not be repaid, so they should spend it now and inflate it away, now think that the government is less likely to repay its existing debts, or less likely to repay future borrowing? If so, even more inflation can break out, seemingly (as always) out of nowhere.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Fiscal Constraints on Monetary Policy&nbsp;</b></p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Fiscal and monetary policies are always intertwined in causing or curing inflation. Even in a pure fiscal theory of the price level, monetary policy (setting interest rates) can control the path of expected future inflation. Thus, whether inflation continues or not also depends on how monetary policy reacts to this fiscal shock and its consequences.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Whether the Fed will do something about it is an obvious concern. The Fed\u2019s habits and new operating procedures, formed before 2019 in a Maginot Line against perpetual below-target inflation, look remarkably like the Fed of about 1971: Let inflation blow hot to march down the Phillips curve to greater employment, wait for inflation to exceed target for a while before doing anything about it, talk about \u201ctransitory\u201d and \u201csupply\u201d shocks to excuse each error. The Fed understands \u201cexpectations\u201d now, unlike in 1971, but seems to view them as a third force amenable to management by \u201cforward guidance\u201d speeches rather than formed by a hardy and skeptical experience with the Fed\u2019s concrete actions. The Fed likes to say it has \u201cthe tools\u201d to contain inflation, but never dares to say just what those tools are. &nbsp;In recent U.S. historical experience, the Fed\u2019s tool is to replay 1980: 20 percent interest rates, a bruising recession hurting the disadvantaged especially, and the medicine applied for as long as it takes. Will our Fed really do that? Will our Congress let our Fed do that? Can you deter an enemy without revealing what\u2019s in your arsenal and whether you will use it?</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>If the Fed needs to fight inflation, fiscal constraints on monetary policy will play a large and unexpected role. In 1980, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 25 percent. Today it is 100 percent, and rising swiftly. Fiscal constraints on monetary policy are four times larger today, and counting.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span> For a rise in interest rates to lower inflation, fiscal policy must tighten as well. Without that fiscal cooperation, monetary policy cannot lower inflation. There are two important channels of this interconnection.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>First, the rise in interest rates raises interest costs on the debt. The government must &nbsp;pay those higher interest costs, by raising tax revenues and cutting spending, or by credibly promising to do so in the future. At 100 percent debt to GDP, 5 percentage points higher interest rates mean an additional deficit of 5 percent of GDP or $1 trillion, for every year that high interest rates continue.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>This consideration is especially relevant if the underlying cause of the inflation is fiscal policy. If we are having inflation because people don\u2019t believe that the government can pay off the deficits it is running to send people checks, and it will not reform the looming larger entitlement promises, then people will not believe that the government can pay off an additional $1 trillion deficit to pay interest costs on the debt. &nbsp;In a fiscally driven inflation, it can happen that the central bank raises rates to fight inflation, which raises the deficit via interest costs, and thereby only makes inflation worse. This has, for example, been an analysis of several episodes in Brazil.</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Second, if monetary policy lowers inflation, then bondholders earn a real windfall. Fiscal policy must tighten to pay this windfall. &nbsp;People who bought 10-year Treasury bonds in September of 1981 got a 15.84 percent yield, as markets expected inflation to continue. From September 1981 to September 1991, the CPI grew at a 3.9 percent average rate. By this back of the envelope calculation, those bondholders got an amazing 12 percent annual real return. That return came completely and entirely courtesy of U.S. taxpayers. &nbsp;The 1986 tax reform and deregulation, which allowed the United States to grow strongly for 20 years, eventually did produce fiscal surpluses that nearly repaid U.S. federal debt. At 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio, each 5 percentage point reduction in the price level requires another 5 percent of GDP fiscal surplus.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Ask yourself, if inflation gets built into bond yields, and the Fed tries to lower inflation, will our Congress really raise tax revenues or cut spending in order to finance an unexpected (by definition) and undeserved (it will surely be argued) windfall profit to wealthy investors, foreign central bankers, and fat-cats on Wall Street? &nbsp;If it does not do so, the monetary attempt at disinflation fails.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>We state too casually that that the United States will always repay its debts, and prioritize that repayment over all else. We should not take such probity for granted. For example, in the 2021 debt ceiling discussion, it stated as fact by all concerned, from the Treasury to Congress to the White House, that hitting the debt ceiling must trigger a formal default. That is untrue. The United States could easily prioritize its tax revenues to repaying interest and principal on outstanding debt, by cutting other spending instead. Painful, yes. Impossible, no. That the U.S. contingency plan for a binding debt ceiling is formal default tells you that the spirit of Alexander Hamilton, preaching the sanctity of debt repayment to build reputation so we can borrow in the future, is truly dead. And with inflation, we are not even talking about formal default. The question is, will the United States undertake a sharp fiscal austerity to support monetary policy in the fight against inflation, by paying higher interest costs on the debt and by repaying bondholders in more valuable money? &nbsp;Or will the government just repay as promised, but in dollars that are worth more than expected? If the government does the latter, monetary policy fails.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>There is a third troublesome requirement for higher nominal interest rates to produce lower inflation. One needs an economic model in which this is true, that model needs to be correct, and its preconditions need to be met. &nbsp;It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, because in the long run, when real interest rates settle down, higher nominal interest rates must come with higher, not lower inflation. So you need an understanding of how and when things work the other direction in the short run.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>In standard new-Keynesian models, used by all central banks, for example, higher interest rates only produce lower inflation if the higher interest rate is unexpected\u2014that is, a \u201cshock\u201d to the economy\u2014and if there is a sharp contemporaneous fiscal contraction, for the above reasons. &nbsp; A widely expected rise in nominal interest rates raises inflation. &nbsp;A rise in interest rates without the corresponding ``austerity\u2019\u2019 raises inflation. &nbsp;Both preconditions are questionable today.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>More complex ingredients, such as long-term debt or financial frictions, can allow a higher nominal rate to temporarily lower inflation. But reliance on more complex ingredients and frictions is also dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Future</b></p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>The future is not hopeless. Inflation control simply requires our government, including the central bank, to understand classic lessons of history. Forestalling inflation is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Stabilizing inflation once it gets out of control is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Expectations are \u201canchored\u201d if people believe such policy is in place, and politicians and Fed officials are ready to act if needed.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>I add \u201cmicro-economic,\u201d as it is perhaps the most frequently overlooked adjective. Fiscal surpluses do not result from sharply higher tax rates, especially of a tax system so riven with economic distortions as ours. Fiscal surpluses can come from spending restraint, but that too is difficult. The best road to fiscal surpluses is strong economic growth, which increases the tax base and lowers the need for social spending. &nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>In the conundrum between taxes and spending, there is a way out: raise long-term economic growth. And there is only one way to do that: to increase the supply-side capacity of the economy. That is, however, just as politically controversial as the first two options. Most of the job is to get out of the way. Most economic regulation is designed to transfer incomes, to protect various interests, or to push on the scales of bilateral negotiation, to undo the harsh siren of economic incentives, in a way that stifles economic growth. Many interests hate pro-growth legislation and regulation just as much as they hate taxes and spending cuts. The r&lt;g crowd has a point, but increasing g is the answer.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Much of the \u201csupply shocks\u201d of 2021 come down to the \u201cgreat resignation\u201d\u2014that is, &nbsp;the puzzling decline in labor force participation despite a labor shortage. The work disincentives of social programs\u2014paying people not to work, bluntly\u2014are laid bare.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>All successful inflation stabilizations have combined monetary, fiscal, and micro-economic reforms. I emphasize reforms. In most cases the tax system is reformed to provide more revenue with less distortion. The structure of spending programs is reformed to help people in need more efficiently without work disincentives. Regulations are reformed, though they hurt the profits of incumbents, to increase entry, competition and innovation. &nbsp;The policy regime is changed, durably. Reversible decisions and pie-crust promises do not do much to change the present value of surpluses, to raise the government\u2019s ability to pledge a long stream of surpluses to support debt.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>1980 did not succeed in the United States from monetary toughness only. &nbsp;1980 included supply-side deregulation, and was quickly followed by the 1982 and 1986 tax reforms. The economy took off, so by the late 1990s economists were seriously writing papers about what to do when the federal debt had all been repaid. Many monetary stabilizations have been tried without fiscal and microeconomic reform. They typically fail after a year or two. The history of Latin America is littered with them (Kehoe and Nicolini 2021). &nbsp;The high interest rates of the early 1980s likely represented a fear that the United States would suffer the same fate. The 1970s were not just a failure of monetary policy. The deficits of the great society and Vietnam War contributed, while the supply \u201cshocks\u201d and productivity slowdown did their part.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>These points are especially important if the 2021 inflation turns in to a sustained 2020s inflation, as the 1971 inflation turned in to a sustained 1970s inflation. For this time, the roots of inflation will most likely be fiscal, a broad change of view that our government really will not eventually reform and repay its debt. The only fundamental answer to that question will be, to reform and set in place a durable structure that will repay debt. Monetary machination will be pointless.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>A small bout of inflation may be useful to our body politic. Inflation is where dreams of costless fiscal expansion, flooding the country with borrowed money to address every perceived problem, hit a hard brick wall of reality. &nbsp;A small bout of inflation and debt problems may reteach our politicians, officials, and commentariat the classic lessons that &nbsp;there are fiscal limits, fiscal and monetary policy are intertwined, and that a country with solid long-term institutions can borrow, but a country without them is in trouble, and one must allow the golden goose to thrive if one wants to tax her eggs. A small bout of inflation may reteach the same classes that supply matters, incentives matter, and sand in the gears matter. &nbsp;The 1980s reforms only happened because the 1970s were so painful. &nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>In the meantime, however, there is one technical thing the Fed and Treasury can do to forestall a larger crisis: borrow long. &nbsp;Interest costs feed into the budget as debt rolls over. U.S. debt is shockingly short maturity, rolled over on average about every two years. If the United States borrows long-term, then higher interest rates do not raise interest costs on existing debt at all. Shifting to long-term debt would remove one of the main fiscal constraints on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has not helped this fiscal constraint, by transforming a fifth of the federal debt to overnight, floating-rate debt. The 30-year Treasury rate is, as I write 2 percent, about negative 1 percent in real terms. Okay, the 1-year rate is 0.13 percent. As long as this lasts, the government seems to pay lower interest costs. &nbsp;But a 1.87 percent insurance premium to wipe out the danger of a sovereign debt crisis and to buy huge fiscal space to fight inflation seems like a pretty cheap insurance policy. The window of opportunity will not last long, however, as interest rates are already creeping up.&nbsp;</p><p><b>References</b></p><p>Cochrane, J. H.

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog This is an essay, prepared for the CATO 39th annual monetary policy conference. \u00a0It will appear in a CATO book edited by Jim Dorn. This is a longer and more academic piece underlying \"The ghost of Christmas inflation.\"\u00a0Video of the conference presentation.\u00a0This essay in pdf form.\u00a0 FISCAL INFLATION\u00a0 John H. Cochrane  From its inflection point in February 2021 to November 2021, the CPI rose 6 percent (278.88/263.161), an 8 percent annualized rate. \u00a0Why?\u00a0 Starting in March 2020, in response to the disruptions of Covid-19, the U.S. government created about $3 trillion of new bank reserves, equivalent to cash, and sent checks to people and businesses. (Mechanically, the Treasury issued $3 trillion of new debt, which the Fed quickly bought in return for $3 trillion of new reserves. The Treasury sent out checks, transferring the reserves to people\u2019s banks. See Table 1.) \u00a0The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so, and sent more checks. Overall federal debt rose nearly 30 percent. Is it at all a surprise that a year later inflation breaks out? \u00a0It is hard to ask for a clearer demonstration of fiscal inflation, an immense fiscal helicopter drop, exhibit A for the fiscal theory of the price level (Cochrane 2022a, 2022b). \u00a0 What Dropped from the Helicopter?\u00a0 From December 2019 to September 2021, the M2 money stock also increased by $5.6 trillion. \u00a0This looks like a monetary, not a fiscal intervention, Milton Friedman\u2019s (1969) classic tale that if you want inflation, drop money from helicopters. But is it monetary or fiscal policy? Ask yourself: Suppose the expansion of M2 had been entirely financed by purchasing Treasury securities. Imagine Treasury debt had declined $5 trillion while M2 and reserves rose $5 trillion. Imagine that there had been no deficit at all, or even a surplus during this period. The monetary theory of inflation, MV=PY, states that we would see the same inflation. Really?  Similarly, ask yourself: Suppose that the Federal Reserve had refused to go along. Suppose that the Treasury had sent people Treasury bills directly, accounts at Treasury.gov, along with directions how to sell them if people wished to do so. Better, suppose that the Treasury had created new mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and sent people mutual fund shares. (I write mutual fund as money market funds are counted in M2.) The monetary theory of inflation says again that this would have had no effect. These would be a debt issue, causing no inflation, not a monetary expansion. Really?\u00a0   Clearly, overall debt matters, not the split of government debt between interest-paying reserves or monetary base and Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve itself is nothing more than an immense money-market fund, offering shares that are pegged at $1 each, pay interest, and are backed by a portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. (Plus, an army of regulators and a huge staff of economists who are supposed to help forecast inflation.)\u00a0  Milton Friedman\u2019s (1969) helicopter drop is a powerful parable. But a helicopter drop is a fiscal policy, not a monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve may not legally drop money from helicopters; it may not write checks to voters. The Fed may even less vacuum up money; it may not tax people. Helicopter drops and money vacuums are fiscal operations. The Fed may only lend money, or buy and sell assets. To accomplish a helicopter drop in the United States, the Treasury must issue debt, the Fed must buy it with newly printed money, and then the Treasury must drop that money from helicopters, writing it down as a transfer payment. And that is pretty much exactly what happened.\u00a0  Ask yourself: If, as Friedman\u2019s helicopter is dropping $1,000 on each household, the Fed sends burglars who remove $1,000 of Treasury securities from the same households, would we still see inflation? That\u2019s monetary policy. If Friedman\u2019s helicopter were followed by the Treasury secretary with a bullhorn, shouting \u201cEnjoy your $1,000 in helicopter money. Taxes are going up $1,000 tomorrow,\u201d would we still see inflation?\u00a0  Friedman\u2019s helicopters are not a monetary change, a substitution of money for debt, an increase in the liquidity of a given set of household assets. They are a \u201cwealth effect\u201d of government debt. Dropping debt from helicopters is a brilliant psychological device for convincing people that the government debt raining down on them will not be repaid by future taxes or spending restraint. It will be left outstanding, so they had better spend it now.\u00a0 Indeed, we just witnessed a \u201chelicopter drop.\u201d But a helicopter drop is fiscal policy.\u00a0  Why did fiscal inflation not happen sooner? The government has been borrowing money like the proverbial drunken sailor, for decades. The Fed has been buying Treasury securities and turning the debt into reserves for a decade. Why now?  Inflation comes when government debt increases, relative to people\u2019s expectations of what the government will repay. If the Treasury borrows, but everyone understands it will later raise tax revenues or cut spending to repay the debt, that debt does not cause inflation. It is a good investment, and people are happy to hold on to it. If the Fed prints up a lot of money, buys Treasury debt, and the Treasury hands out the money, as happened, but everyone understands the Treasury will pay back the debt with future surpluses, the extra money causes no inflation. The Fed can always soak up the money by selling its Treasury securities, and the Treasury repays those securities with surpluses (i.e., taxes less spending).\u00a0  The 2020\u20132021 borrowing and money episode was distinctive because, evidently, it came without a corresponding increase in expectations that the government would, someday, raise surpluses by $5 trillion in present value to repay the debt. \u00a0Looking in to people\u2019s heads is hard, but why? We can at least find some plausible speculations.\u00a0 One may look to politicians\u2019 statements. Even in the Obama-era \u201cstimulus\u201d spending, the administration emphasized promises of eventual debt reduction. One may chuckle and sneer at promises to repay debts decades after an administration leaves office, but at least they went through the motions to make that promise! Nobody went through any motions about long-run fiscal planning, long-run deficit reduction, and entitlement and tax reform, in 2020\u20132021. \u00a0It was the era of modern monetary theory (MMT), of costless \u201cfiscal expansion\u201d made possible, or so it was claimed, by the manna-from-heaven that interest rates would stay low forever.\u00a0  The manner of fiscal expansion matters too. When the Treasury borrows in the usual manner, it borrows from established long-term investors, who view Treasury debt as debt that will be repaid and not defaulted or inflated. They view it as a savings or investment vehicle, not as cash to be spent. They save, or invest, based on long and so-far mostly successful experience. This time, following canary-in-the-coal mine disruptions in Treasury markets during March 2020, the Federal Reserve immediately bought new Treasury debt with newly created money, before it even touched these investor\u2019s portfolios. The effect of the operation was to print new money and send people checks, so the debt issue is now held as bank deposits flowing into reserves, rather than as Treasury securities. People holding this new money are likely to spend it rather than regard it as a long-term investment. \u00a0In our simplest economic models, it does not matter who holds the debt. But in just a little more nuanced view, who holds the debt matters.\u00a0  In our simplest economic models, interest-paying reserves and Treasuries are equivalent securities. But people likely do see a difference between reserves and short-run Treasuries. Treasuries may well carry a reputation that they will be repaid, while people assume reserves will not be repaid by larger surpluses. Then issuing lots of reserves rather than Treasuries is inflationary, but not because the reserves are ``money,\u2019\u2019 but rather because they convey a different set of fiscal expectations, just as dropping money or debt from helicopters sends a different signal about repayment than issuing debt at a Treasury auction. Most of the previous operations financed government spending or government worker salaries, counting on higher incomes to slowly filter through the economy. This one sent checks directly to people. \u00a0  Finally, this fiscal stimulus was enormous, and carried out on a deep misdiagnosis of the state of the economy. Even in simplistic hydraulic Keynesian terms, $5 trillion times any multiplier is much larger than any plausible GDP gap. And the Covid recession was not due to a demand deficiency in the first place. A pandemic is, to the economy, like a huge snowstorm. Sending people money will not get them to go out to closed bars, restaurants, airlines, and businesses.\u00a0 \u201cStimulus,\u201d \u201caccommodation,\u201d \u201ceasing\u201d was the point. This method finally worked, where previous stimulus efforts failed. One can see several suggestive differences, which amount to important economic lessons.  What about \u201csupply shocks?\u201d What about a shift of demand from services to durables? Much analysis misses the difference between relative prices and inflation, in which all prices and wages rise together. A supply shock makes one good more expensive than others. Only demand makes all goods rise together. There wouldn\u2019t be \u201csupply chain\u201d problems if people were not trying to buy things like mad! A shift in demand from services to durables can make durable prices go up. But it would make services prices go down. And let us not even go down the ridiculous path of blaming inflation on a sudden contagious outbreak of \u201cgreed\u201d and \u201ccollusion\u201d by businesses from oil companies to turkey farmers, needing the administration to send the FTC out to investigate.\u00a0  It is telling that inflation was a complete surprise to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve\u2019s job is supposed to be to monitor the supply capacity of the economy and to make sure demand does not outstrip it. \u00a0The Fed failed twice. First, the economy did not need demand-side stimulus. Insurance was wise, and forestalling a financial crisis was necessary. But sending money to every citizen to stoke demand was not. Second, the Fed being surprised by supply shocks is as excusable as the Army losing a battle because its leaders are surprised that the enemy might attack. \u00a0As we see by the outcome, the Fed\u2019s understanding of supply, largely based on statistical analysis of labor markets, is rudimentary.\u00a0 \u00a0 WilI Inflation Continue?\u00a0  If the government borrows or prints $5 trillion, with no change in its plan to repay debt, on top of $17 trillion outstanding debt, then the price level will rise a cumulative 30 percent, so that the $22 trillion of debt is worth in real terms what the $17 trillion was before. In essence, absent a credible increase in future surpluses, the deficit is financed by defaulting on $5 trillion of outstanding debt, via inflation. By this calculation, the 6 percent or so cumulative inflation we have seen so far leaves a way to go. \u00a0But people may think some of the debt will be repaid. If they think half will eventually be repaid, then the price level need only rise 15 percent overall.\u00a0  But then it stops. A one-time unbacked debt increase leads to a one-time price-level increase, not continuing inflation. Whether inflation continues or not depends on future \u00a0monetary policy, future fiscal policy, and whether people change their minds about overall debt repayment. \u00a0  Fiscal policy may not be done with us yet. If unbacked fiscal expansions continue\u2014that is, borrowing when people do not expect additional repayment\u2014then additional bouts of fiscal inflation will occur. Untold trillions of spending, including new entitlements, with no realistic hope of raising tax revenues commensurately to cover them are certainly high on the Biden administration\u2019s agenda. (Higher tax rates do not necessarily mean higher revenues, if economic growth falters; and even so the proposed taxes do not cover the proposed spending increases even with static scoring.) The mentality that borrowed money need never be repaid, because the MMT fairy or r<g magic makes debt free, remains strong in Washington. \u00a0But the failure of the so-called \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan may augur well for budget seriousness and a limit to ill-constructed social policies with strong supply disincentives.\u00a0  The most troublesome question remains: Do people, having decided that at least some of our government\u2019s new debt will not be repaid, so they should spend it now and inflate it away, now think that the government is less likely to repay its existing debts, or less likely to repay future borrowing? If so, even more inflation can break out, seemingly (as always) out of nowhere.\u00a0 Fiscal Constraints on Monetary Policy\u00a0  Fiscal and monetary policies are always intertwined in causing or curing inflation. Even in a pure fiscal theory of the price level, monetary policy (setting interest rates) can control the path of expected future inflation. Thus, whether inflation continues or not also depends on how monetary policy reacts to this fiscal shock and its consequences.\u00a0  Whether the Fed will do something about it is an obvious concern. The Fed\u2019s habits and new operating procedures, formed before 2019 in a Maginot Line against perpetual below-target inflation, look remarkably like the Fed of about 1971: Let inflation blow hot to march down the Phillips curve to greater employment, wait for inflation to exceed target for a while before doing anything about it, talk about \u201ctransitory\u201d and \u201csupply\u201d shocks to excuse each error. The Fed understands \u201cexpectations\u201d now, unlike in 1971, but seems to view them as a third force amenable to management by \u201cforward guidance\u201d speeches rather than formed by a hardy and skeptical experience with the Fed\u2019s concrete actions. The Fed likes to say it has \u201cthe tools\u201d to contain inflation, but never dares to say just what those tools are. \u00a0In recent U.S. historical experience, the Fed\u2019s tool is to replay 1980: 20 percent interest rates, a bruising recession hurting the disadvantaged especially, and the medicine applied for as long as it takes. Will our Fed really do that? Will our Congress let our Fed do that? Can you deter an enemy without revealing what\u2019s in your arsenal and whether you will use it?  If the Fed needs to fight inflation, fiscal constraints on monetary policy will play a large and unexpected role. In 1980, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 25 percent. Today it is 100 percent, and rising swiftly. Fiscal constraints on monetary policy are four times larger today, and counting.\u00a0   For a rise in interest rates to lower inflation, fiscal policy must tighten as well. Without that fiscal cooperation, monetary policy cannot lower inflation. There are two important channels of this interconnection.\u00a0  First, the rise in interest rates raises interest costs on the debt. The government must \u00a0pay those higher interest costs, by raising tax revenues and cutting spending, or by credibly promising to do so in the future. At 100 percent debt to GDP, 5 percentage points higher interest rates mean an additional deficit of 5 percent of GDP or $1 trillion, for every year that high interest rates continue.\u00a0  This consideration is especially relevant if the underlying cause of the inflation is fiscal policy. If we are having inflation because people don\u2019t believe that the government can pay off the deficits it is running to send people checks, and it will not reform the looming larger entitlement promises, then people will not believe that the government can pay off an additional $1 trillion deficit to pay interest costs on the debt. \u00a0In a fiscally driven inflation, it can happen that the central bank raises rates to fight inflation, which raises the deficit via interest costs, and thereby only makes inflation worse. This has, for example, been an analysis of several episodes in Brazil.  Second, if monetary policy lowers inflation, then bondholders earn a real windfall. Fiscal policy must tighten to pay this windfall. \u00a0People who bought 10-year Treasury bonds in September of 1981 got a 15.84 percent yield, as markets expected inflation to continue. From September 1981 to September 1991, the CPI grew at a 3.9 percent average rate. By this back of the envelope calculation, those bondholders got an amazing 12 percent annual real return. That return came completely and entirely courtesy of U.S. taxpayers. \u00a0The 1986 tax reform and deregulation, which allowed the United States to grow strongly for 20 years, eventually did produce fiscal surpluses that nearly repaid U.S. federal debt. At 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio, each 5 percentage point reduction in the price level requires another 5 percent of GDP fiscal surplus.\u00a0  Ask yourself, if inflation gets built into bond yields, and the Fed tries to lower inflation, will our Congress really raise tax revenues or cut spending in order to finance an unexpected (by definition) and undeserved (it will surely be argued) windfall profit to wealthy investors, foreign central bankers, and fat-cats on Wall Street? \u00a0If it does not do so, the monetary attempt at disinflation fails.\u00a0  We state too casually that that the United States will always repay its debts, and prioritize that repayment over all else. We should not take such probity for granted. For example, in the 2021 debt ceiling discussion, it stated as fact by all concerned, from the Treasury to Congress to the White House, that hitting the debt ceiling must trigger a formal default. That is untrue. The United States could easily prioritize its tax revenues to repaying interest and principal on outstanding debt, by cutting other spending instead. Painful, yes. Impossible, no. That the U.S. contingency plan for a binding debt ceiling is formal default tells you that the spirit of Alexander Hamilton, preaching the sanctity of debt repayment to build reputation so we can borrow in the future, is truly dead. And with inflation, we are not even talking about formal default. The question is, will the United States undertake a sharp fiscal austerity to support monetary policy in the fight against inflation, by paying higher interest costs on the debt and by repaying bondholders in more valuable money? \u00a0Or will the government just repay as promised, but in dollars that are worth more than expected? If the government does the latter, monetary policy fails.\u00a0  There is a third troublesome requirement for higher nominal interest rates to produce lower inflation. One needs an economic model in which this is true, that model needs to be correct, and its preconditions need to be met. \u00a0It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, because in the long run, when real interest rates settle down, higher nominal interest rates must come with higher, not lower inflation. So you need an understanding of how and when things work the other direction in the short run.\u00a0  In standard new-Keynesian models, used by all central banks, for example, higher interest rates only produce lower inflation if the higher interest rate is unexpected\u2014that is, a \u201cshock\u201d to the economy\u2014and if there is a sharp contemporaneous fiscal contraction, for the above reasons. \u00a0 A widely expected rise in nominal interest rates raises inflation. \u00a0A rise in interest rates without the corresponding ``austerity\u2019\u2019 raises inflation. \u00a0Both preconditions are questionable today. More complex ingredients, such as long-term debt or financial frictions, can allow a higher nominal rate to temporarily lower inflation. But reliance on more complex ingredients and frictions is also dangerous.\u00a0 The Future  The future is not hopeless. Inflation control simply requires our government, including the central bank, to understand classic lessons of history. Forestalling inflation is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Stabilizing inflation once it gets out of control is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Expectations are \u201canchored\u201d if people believe such policy is in place, and politicians and Fed officials are ready to act if needed.\u00a0  I add \u201cmicro-economic,\u201d as it is perhaps the most frequently overlooked adjective. Fiscal surpluses do not result from sharply higher tax rates, especially of a tax system so riven with economic distortions as ours. Fiscal surpluses can come from spending restraint, but that too is difficult. The best road to fiscal surpluses is strong economic growth, which increases the tax base and lowers the need for social spending. \u00a0  In the conundrum between taxes and spending, there is a way out: raise long-term economic growth. And there is only one way to do that: to increase the supply-side capacity of the economy. That is, however, just as politically controversial as the first two options. Most of the job is to get out of the way. Most economic regulation is designed to transfer incomes, to protect various interests, or to push on the scales of bilateral negotiation, to undo the harsh siren of economic incentives, in a way that stifles economic growth. Many interests hate pro-growth legislation and regulation just as much as they hate taxes and spending cuts. The r<g crowd has a point, but increasing g is the answer.\u00a0  Much of the \u201csupply shocks\u201d of 2021 come down to the \u201cgreat resignation\u201d\u2014that is, \u00a0the puzzling decline in labor force participation despite a labor shortage. The work disincentives of social programs\u2014paying people not to work, bluntly\u2014are laid bare.\u00a0  All successful inflation stabilizations have combined monetary, fiscal, and micro-economic reforms. I emphasize reforms. In most cases the tax system is reformed to provide more revenue with less distortion. The structure of spending programs is reformed to help people in need more efficiently without work disincentives. Regulations are reformed, though they hurt the profits of incumbents, to increase entry, competition and innovation. \u00a0The policy regime is changed, durably. Reversible decisions and pie-crust promises do not do much to change the present value of surpluses, to raise the government\u2019s ability to pledge a long stream of surpluses to support debt.\u00a0  1980 did not succeed in the United States from monetary toughness only. \u00a01980 included supply-side deregulation, and was quickly followed by the 1982 and 1986 tax reforms. The economy took off, so by the late 1990s economists were seriously writing papers about what to do when the federal debt had all been repaid. Many monetary stabilizations have been tried without fiscal and microeconomic reform. They typically fail after a year or two. The history of Latin America is littered with them (Kehoe and Nicolini 2021). \u00a0The high interest rates of the early 1980s likely represented a fear that the United States would suffer the same fate. The 1970s were not just a failure of monetary policy. The deficits of the great society and Vietnam War contributed, while the supply \u201cshocks\u201d and productivity slowdown did their part.\u00a0  These points are especially important if the 2021 inflation turns in to a sustained 2020s inflation, as the 1971 inflation turned in to a sustained 1970s inflation. For this time, the roots of inflation will most likely be fiscal, a broad change of view that our government really will not eventually reform and repay its debt. The only fundamental answer to that question will be, to reform and set in place a durable structure that will repay debt. Monetary machination will be pointless.\u00a0  A small bout of inflation may be useful to our body politic. Inflation is where dreams of costless fiscal expansion, flooding the country with borrowed money to address every perceived problem, hit a hard brick wall of reality. \u00a0A small bout of inflation and debt problems may reteach our politicians, officials, and commentariat the classic lessons that \u00a0there are fiscal limits, fiscal and monetary policy are intertwined, and that a country with solid long-term institutions can borrow, but a country without them is in trouble, and one must allow the golden goose to thrive if one wants to tax her eggs. A small bout of inflation may reteach the same classes that supply matters, incentives matter, and sand in the gears matter. \u00a0The 1980s reforms only happened because the 1970s were so painful. \u00a0  In the meantime, however, there is one technical thing the Fed and Treasury can do to forestall a larger crisis: borrow long. \u00a0Interest costs feed into the budget as debt rolls over. U.S. debt is shockingly short maturity, rolled over on average about every two years. If the United States borrows long-term, then higher interest rates do not raise interest costs on existing debt at all. Shifting to long-term debt would remove one of the main fiscal constraints on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has not helped this fiscal constraint, by transforming a fifth of the federal debt to overnight, floating-rate debt. The 30-year Treasury rate is, as I write 2 percent, about negative 1 percent in real terms. Okay, the 1-year rate is 0.13 percent. As long as this lasts, the government seems to pay lower interest costs. \u00a0But a 1.87 percent insurance premium to wipe out the danger of a sovereign debt crisis and to buy huge fiscal space to fight inflation seems like a pretty cheap insurance policy. The window of opportunity will not last long, however, as interest rates are already creeping up.\u00a0 References Cochrane, J. H.

Increase the duration of the debt is the answer.  I thought Greenspan was wrong when he went focused on lowering duration and concentrating on 10 year notes rather than 30 yr bonds.  Issue 30, 50, and 100 year bonds.  America might be the only country that could get that done at low interest rates.   Greenspan wasn't Treasury Secretary at that time.You can lay the responsibility for that choice at the feet of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy Larry Summers. No, issue perpetuities! And fixed-for-floating swaps!  \"Clearly, overall debt matters, not the split of government debt between interest-paying reserves or monetary base and Treasury securities.\"Apparently not since perpetuities would count toward the overall debt level.\"To accomplish a helicopter drop in the United States, the Treasury must issue debt, the Fed must buy it with newly printed money, and then the Treasury must drop that money from helicopters, writing it down as a transfer payment. And that is pretty much exactly what happened.\"And how do perpetuities or 100 year bonds prevent the Fed from buying them with newly printed money?   Perhaps Treasury should sell something (for instance equity) that the Fed can't legally purchase?\"One may look to politicians\u2019 statements. Even in the Obama-era stimulus spending, the administration emphasized promises of eventual debt reduction.\"No it didn't.  The Obama administration's \"stimulus\" was primarily a debt swap (private banking debt for public Treasury debt).  You can see it in TCMDO here:Change units to year over year percentage growth.  Total debt (public and private) grew at 10.5% y/y in fourth quarter of 2007 and then stayed between 2% and 4% for all of Obama's administration (2008-2016). This comment has been removed by the author. That's what the government is already doing: issuing perpetuities. Since, as you said in your post, nobody is expecting the government paying back the debt ever, it is issuing perpetuities.True, the perpetuities the government is issuing now include a \"feature\": they have \"liquidity windows\" on which the government will attempt, on a best effort basis, to find other investors that provide the liquidity the bonds you hold today. Since the risk is all on the hands of the present investors (they have no collateral to claim and no assets will be seized if the government fails to find new suckers in those liquidity windows) this feature is, mostly, irrelevant and does not make a big difference with actual perpetuities. El Emperador,True perpetuities have no roll over or redemption date.The petpetuities that the central bank is issuing are the FRN's that they use to purchase the Treasury bonds. I think that if the US tries to place perpetuities right now it would fail. No one will take that duration risk in a new thin market (well maybe Goldman would stuff it into their customer's portfolios). It may be seen as  a sign that an adult is in charge at Treasury, or seen as a sign that the Government is finally seeing the problems above and preparing for a crisis.   \"JC - The 1980s reforms only happened because the 1970s were so painful.\"The other \"reform\" that happened in the 1990's was that Bob Rubin and Larry Summers while at the Treasury decided to shorten the term structure of the Federal debt to help reduce interest expenditures and bring federal expenditures (including interest payments) in line with federal receipts.\"JC - In the meantime, however, there is one technical thing the Fed and Treasury can do to forestall a larger crisis: borrow long.\"So the plan is for the Treasury to borrow long until the necessary \"reforms\" are enacted by a future Congress and Treasury and one of those \"reforms\" is for a future Treasury to reduce the term structure of the federal debt? \"The 1986 tax reform and deregulation, which allowed the United States to grow strongly for 20 years, eventually did produce fiscal surpluses that nearly repaid U.S. federal debt.\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986\"The act lowered federal income tax rates, decreasing the number of tax brackets and reducing the top tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent.\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1993\"The act increased the top federal income tax rate from 31% to 39.6%, increased the corporate income tax rate, raised fuel taxes, and raised various other taxes.\"If by eventually, you mean that the top marginal tax rate was \"eventually\" raised from 28% up to 39.6%, after being lowered from 50% to 28%, then yes the 1986 tax reform \"led\" to eventual surpluses. Much of the \u201csupply shocks\u201d of 2021 come down to the \u201cgreat resignation\u201d\u2014that is,  the puzzling decline in labor force participation despite a labor shortage. The work disincentives of social programs\u2014paying people not to work, bluntly\u2014are laid bare.Well...The CIVRATE has dropped for a few reasons;1. The pandemic accelerated retirement for a large chunk of baby boomers. 2. Women leaving the workforce to take care of children because schools and daycares being unavailable. Women still have the highest demand for temporal flexibility. 3. Fear of returning to work for fear of getting infected. Not an unreasonable fear. Guilting and shaming people back to work is rarely useful.4. A game of chicken between employers and employees. The demand for temporal flexibility is increasing amongst both genders. Non-pecuniary benefits are becoming more important. Who will flinch first? The fiscal helicopter drops weren't just for saving consumption. It was used to pay rent and also to pay down debt. As the blizzard is largely over, yes, those with cash in hand need an asbestos wallet so it doesn't burn a hole in their pockets. But the labor shortages are creating cost push inflation on top of demand pull. But let's not lay the blame for the dysfunctional labor market at the feet of the fiscal side for plugging a huge hole due to lockdowns.  \"From December 2019 to September 2021, the M2 money stock also increased by $5.6 trillion.  This looks like a monetary, not a fiscal intervention, Milton Friedman\u2019s (1969) classic tale that if you want inflation, drop money from helicopters. But is it monetary or fiscal policy? Ask yourself: Suppose the expansion of M2 had been entirely financed by purchasing Treasury securities. Imagine Treasury debt had declined $5 trillion while M2 and reserves rose $5 trillion. Imagine that there had been no deficit at all, or even a surplus during this period. The monetary theory of inflation, MV=PY, states that we would see the same inflation. Really?  Similarly, ask yourself: Suppose that the Federal Reserve had refused to go along. Suppose that the Treasury had sent people Treasury bills directly, accounts at Treasury.gov, along with directions how to sell them if people wished to do so. Better, suppose that the Treasury had created new mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and sent people mutual fund shares. (I write mutual fund as money market funds are counted in M2.) The monetary theory of inflation says again that this would have had no effect. These would be a debt issue, causing no inflation, not a monetary expansion. Really?\"I feel like this is a really important paragraph of the article. All else equal, I would prefer more in depth discussion on how the fiscal theory and monetary theory differ. The \"Really?\"s in it make me a bit suspicious that I am not getting the full story. I worry that someone who believes the monetary theory might argue that this does not represent their views.  The truth is that borrowing activities in general have inflationary effects. In the past when most borrowings are in the form of bank loans, monetary aggregates are a good proxy of borrowing activities (since loans create deposits which go into M2). Nowadays that bonds player a much greater role, bond issuances (including by the government which is fiscal policy) are also inflationary, even when they just involve transfer of money between non-bank sectors (and hence do not affect M2). For example, if I have $100 deposit at a bank. I borrow $100 from the bank, and use it to buy a sandwich from a shop, who deposits the $100 at the same bank. So sandwich price goes up, and M2 goes up by $100.Now if I buy $100 of bills issued by the government, who pays $100 to the sandwich shop, and the shop then deposits the money at the same bank. So sandwich price goes up while total deposits (M2) say the same. \"dollars that are worth more than expected\" -> \"dollars that are worth less than expected\"? For once that's not a typo. In 1980, 10 year rates rose to 15%, as people expected inflation to stay that high. When inflation fell to 3%, the bondholders got paid back in dollars worth more than they had expected. I could have phrased that more clearly.  You had me at... \"Ask yourself: If, as Friedman\u2019s helicopter is dropping $1,000 on each household, the Fed sends burglars who remove $1,000 of Treasury securities from the same household\". Pure gold (no pun intended). as I have kids I find this immensely depressing! I see people thinking this is the Best of Times...like Wall Street bankers, bitcoiners, Billionaires, Democrats....This is WORST OF TIMES! Anyone thinking person knows this will end REALLY REALLY BAD MMT stand for Modern Monetary Theory?  I thought it stood for Magical Monetary Theory.  My mistake, I guess. Or Nagical Money Tree. It's a structural shift away from Monetary policy to the Fiscal side. Problem is that assuming taxes will take out excess supply and then redistribute all over again? I have doubts about that mechanism but maybe I got it wrong. There will still be tax avoidance and evasion. At least with NY's OMO office, supply can be adjusted with mechanisms that generally \"work.\" The one upside to at least trying out MMT is that if it doesn't work, the stake can be put in the vampire relatively easily. The effectiveness lag of Fiscal is immediate compared to that of the Fed. But the Fed wins on the implementation side.  Raising taxes or reducing spending strikes me as being two sides of the same coin. Either way, somebody's ox is going to get gored. More importantly, politicians are loath to take anything away from their voters that might affect their reelection chances. While many voices will decry inflation, in all likelihood, politicians will do what they have always done - nothing - pass the buck (literally) and hope that we can somehow inflate our way out of this problem. And, if the GOP is successful in retaking Congress and the White House, it seems unlikely that will do anything more than keep spending. As a New Year's sentiment let me say how much I have enjoyed these blogs by John Cochrane over the years.As a layman, I find myself swayed but not convinced by the last arguments I read by any prominent macroeconomist.I wish you guys would come up with a common perspective. John reminds me of a gentlemen I met in the grocery store.Each day he would ask the cashier in the produce section if they have fresh pomegranates.  The cashier would kindly respond to the gentleman that they have bottled pomegranate juice (POM Wonderful or some other variety) but do not carry fresh pomegranates.One day the same gentleman asks the same question again.  To my surprise the cashier points to a section of the produce department and indicates that yes they now carry fresh pomegranates.  The gentleman walks back to that section, looks over the selection of pomegranates and then walks away.My curiousity peaked, I walk over to the gentleman and ask him why he didn't purchase any.  He replies that he doesn't care for pomegranates at all. Let's do a test. (1) Inflation was rising in 1965-66, and the Fed tightened.  Meanwhile, the budget deficit got larger from LBJ guns-and-butter budget.  Inflation fell.    Sounds like Fed tightening mattered, not the deficit.LBJ literally slammed Fed Chair Martin against the wall at his ranch.  Talk about fiscal dominance!  Martin eased, and inflation rose. (2)  Reagan cut taxes and increased defense spending, and the deficit surged.   Meanwhile, Volcker tightened to the max, and we had a recession and inflation plunged.   Fed tightening mattered.   The deficit did not. (3) We had a gigantic deficit in 2009 with no promise to pay it off.  That is how we got TEA Party protests.   But inflation turned in deflation.   A negative shock to aggregate demand could be the explanation.  Fiscal theory doesn't cut it.  FTPL seems to depend on expectations of future austerity.   But we have no way to measure such expectations.  It becomes a non-testable conjecture. The confusion of monetary and fiscal policies seem to happen when the overnight rate is zero, which blurs the distinction between money and Tbills.   I am being pedantic, but here goes.You talk about a five percent increase in interest rates.Are you really thinking about a five percentage point rise in interest rates? Those two sentences are not the same thing.   You are correct, and I should write percentage points. That's accuracy not pedantry!  Your support for accuracy is commendable.  Thanks The economy runs on energy not the various intermediate goods.  Debt is a IOU on future energy. It would appear that continued growth in future energy is questionable.  Some seem to be saying that the off book government debt will also be a problem.  The Fed is using Ducktape to hold things together in the face of energy depletion.  Growth proponents need an appendix to detail where the required resources will come from.   Two other notes re perpetuities: if the Treasury were to issue perpetuities it would have to come up with an iron-clad guarantee that it would not borrow more than say x % of total debt (50%?) in short term instruments ever again, else what would be the point (aside for paradoxically enabling even more reckless borrowing). TY will also  have to swap in or retire existing short term debt subject to this rule as well to get to this operating point. A proposal would have to have teeth too, though, as everyone would know that when the next Build Back Better is proposed and congress starts looking in the couch cushions for coins to pretend to cover spending, they will borrow again at the front of the curve to shave a couple of basis points on the projected interest.As to credibility- Yellen would have been the ideal candidate to show a TY sec with spine managing the term structure of the GOVT debt, but I must admit I am very disappointed in Yellen so far: seems she not only drinks the Kool-Aid, she is now pouring it.Second, can you issue perpetuities when interest rates are so incredibly low? Say they are issued at 2.5% coupon, it is definitely in the realm of possibility to have yields go to 5%, in which case there will be a massive capital loss for holders. And who will scoop up the perpetuities -- as it is govt debt, most likely it will be  sucked in as a 'safe asset' in insurance companies and retirement portfolios. Basel will probably encourage it, too. Does anyone have a link that explains this in more detail? I vaguely remember this from my economics courses, but I couldn't find anything after more than an hour of Googling. Thanks!In standard new-Keynesian models, used by all central banks, for example, higher interest rates only produce lower inflation if the higher interest rate is unexpected\u2014that is, a \u201cshock\u201d to the economy . . .A widely expected rise in nominal interest rates raises inflation.\"  An earlier blog post explains this, https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2021/09/inflation-in-shadow-of-debt.html This comment has been removed by the author. Thank you! However, I believe that post explains why the interest rate increase must be accompanied by fiscal tightening. I'm trying to understand why the interest rate increase must be unexpected rather than widely expected. Does anyone have a link? Thank you very much! An expected interest rate increase is already priced in to bonds. And an expected fiscal tightening can't unexpectedly devalue bonds.  \"If the government borrows or prints $5 trillion, with no change in its plan to repay debt, on top of $17 trillion outstanding debt, then the price level will rise a cumulative 30 percent, so that the $22 trillion of debt is worth in real terms what the $17 trillion was before. In essence, absent a credible increase in future surpluses, the deficit is financed by defaulting on $5 trillion of outstanding debt, via inflation.\"It seems that recent reality has had the trillions going directly into the price levels.The share price levels of the FAANG market capitalization increases.Apple is now a $3 trillion company, and there are a few other $ trillion companies.The gov't spends $5 trillion, paying off donors and \"doing good\", and the 5 largest companies all increase their market cap by $1 trillion.  This looks like what has been happening for the last decade, with the new Biden choices to reduce energy supply (higher prices! feeding thru all prices) and enforce vax mandates to fire millions of workers and to supply helicopter money to help folks have more to spend. If the Treasury started trading out its short term debt for long term debt, wouldn\u2019t that immediately spook markets and signal that the Treasury doesn\u2019t think it can repay its debts?  I\u2019m just wondering whether the chosen maturity of Treasury debt has effects on market expectations and beliefs. This comment has been removed by the author.

        "description": "<p>Two pieces stood out from some weekend internet meandering.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/01/dan-wangs-2021-letter.html\" target=\"_blank\">Marginal Revolution</a>&nbsp;points to an excellent <a href=\"https://danwang.co/2021-letter/\" target=\"_blank\">long letter from Dan Wang</a>&nbsp;on China.</p><p>A trenchant part of Dan's essay is, curiously, a few reflections on America. Not bad for living in Shanghai:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The US, for starters, should get better at reform. The federal government has found itself unable to build simple infrastructure or coordinate an effective pandemic response. Somehow the US has evolved to become a political system in which people can dream up a hundred reasons not to do things like \u201cbuild housing in growing areas\u201d or \u201cadmit people with skills into the country.\u201d If the US wants to win a decades-long challenge against a peer competitor, it needs to be able to improve state capacity. ...</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Since the US government is incapable of structural reform, companies now employ algorithm geniuses to help people navigate the healthcare system. This sort of seventh-best solution is typical of a vetocracy. I don\u2019t see that the US government is trying hard to reform institutions; its response is usually to make things more complex (like its healthcare legislation) or throw money at the problem. The proposed bill to increase domestic competitiveness against China, for example, doesn\u2019t substantially fix the science funding agencies that are more concerned with style guides than science; and the infrastructure bill doesn\u2019t seem to address root causes that make American infrastructure the most costly in the world. Congress is sending more money through bad channels.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Stop and savor.&nbsp;<span></span></p><a name=\"more\"></a><p></p><p>In the \"strategic competition\" with China,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>.. the US has demonstrated a superb capacity for self-harm... Entrepreneurial firms in China previously had no time for domestic technologies, preferring instead to buy the best, which is usually American. Then the US government designated them to various blacklists, giving them for the first time ever a business case for building up the domestic ecosystem. The result is that the US has turbo-charged Chinese competition by aligning the country\u2019s most dynamic firms more firmly with Beijing\u2019s self-sufficiency agenda. And in December, I wrote a piece for the Atlantic on US prosecutions of scientists. The state has subjected scientists to the tender mercies of the US criminal justice system, usually for charges related to relatively unimportant issues implicating research integrity. ..</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One redeeming fact for the US is that there has been significant domestic pushback to some of the government\u2019s actions\u2014especially the prosecutions of scientists\u2014such that it\u2019s within the realm of imagination that the US government will substantially modify bad policies. This sort of correction after public criticism is more difficult in China, where critics might end up jailed. The US though should take more seriously the task of cultivating both strong entrepreneurs and a strong state.</p></blockquote><div>A strong state, a strong civil society, and a strong scientific / technocratic establishment are &nbsp;ones that allow and responds to criticism that deviates from The Narrative. Here and in China.&nbsp;</div><p>Back to China, the point of the letter. Regional differences and the power of local governments are quite interesting. I can't effectively summarize observations on Beijing vs. Shanghai vs. Hong Kong vs.&nbsp;Shenzhen, so do read the original.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Beijing\u2019s control tendency isn\u2019t the only story in this country. That spirit is resented by Shanghai and Shenzhen, which mediates it with their commercial tendencies. Pushback from local governments can occasionally mitigate Beijing\u2019s worst ideas. Shanghai and Shenzhen are also sometimes able to help improve the institutional capacity in Beijing.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>On the recent regulatory crackdown:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When Beijing punished Ant Financial and DiDi, all of us were nervous that these companies were pawns in a game of elite politics whose rules aren\u2019t revealed to anyone who isn\u2019t a player. At this point, however, the punishment of these two firms looks rather small compared to everything that happened afterwards: the decapitation of online tutoring, new restrictions on video games, anti-monopoly actions against internet platforms, and passage of statutes governing data and privacy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>No small number of commentators have pointed out that any individual regulation passes muster on technocratic grounds.

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog Two pieces stood out from some weekend internet meandering.\u00a0 Marginal Revolution\u00a0points to an excellent long letter from Dan Wang\u00a0on China. A trenchant part of Dan's essay is, curiously, a few reflections on America. Not bad for living in Shanghai:\u00a0 The US, for starters, should get better at reform. The federal government has found itself unable to build simple infrastructure or coordinate an effective pandemic response. Somehow the US has evolved to become a political system in which people can dream up a hundred reasons not to do things like \u201cbuild housing in growing areas\u201d or \u201cadmit people with skills into the country.\u201d If the US wants to win a decades-long challenge against a peer competitor, it needs to be able to improve state capacity. ... Since the US government is incapable of structural reform, companies now employ algorithm geniuses to help people navigate the healthcare system. This sort of seventh-best solution is typical of a vetocracy. I don\u2019t see that the US government is trying hard to reform institutions; its response is usually to make things more complex (like its healthcare legislation) or throw money at the problem. The proposed bill to increase domestic competitiveness against China, for example, doesn\u2019t substantially fix the science funding agencies that are more concerned with style guides than science; and the infrastructure bill doesn\u2019t seem to address root causes that make American infrastructure the most costly in the world. Congress is sending more money through bad channels. \u00a0Stop and savor.\u00a0  In the \"strategic competition\" with China,\u00a0 .. the US has demonstrated a superb capacity for self-harm... Entrepreneurial firms in China previously had no time for domestic technologies, preferring instead to buy the best, which is usually American. Then the US government designated them to various blacklists, giving them for the first time ever a business case for building up the domestic ecosystem. The result is that the US has turbo-charged Chinese competition by aligning the country\u2019s most dynamic firms more firmly with Beijing\u2019s self-sufficiency agenda. And in December, I wrote a piece for the Atlantic on US prosecutions of scientists. The state has subjected scientists to the tender mercies of the US criminal justice system, usually for charges related to relatively unimportant issues implicating research integrity. .. One redeeming fact for the US is that there has been significant domestic pushback to some of the government\u2019s actions\u2014especially the prosecutions of scientists\u2014such that it\u2019s within the realm of imagination that the US government will substantially modify bad policies. This sort of correction after public criticism is more difficult in China, where critics might end up jailed. The US though should take more seriously the task of cultivating both strong entrepreneurs and a strong state. Back to China, the point of the letter. Regional differences and the power of local governments are quite interesting. I can't effectively summarize observations on Beijing vs. Shanghai vs. Hong Kong vs.\u00a0Shenzhen, so do read the original.\u00a0 Beijing\u2019s control tendency isn\u2019t the only story in this country. That spirit is resented by Shanghai and Shenzhen, which mediates it with their commercial tendencies. Pushback from local governments can occasionally mitigate Beijing\u2019s worst ideas. Shanghai and Shenzhen are also sometimes able to help improve the institutional capacity in Beijing.\u00a0 On the recent regulatory crackdown:\u00a0 When Beijing punished Ant Financial and DiDi, all of us were nervous that these companies were pawns in a game of elite politics whose rules aren\u2019t revealed to anyone who isn\u2019t a player. At this point, however, the punishment of these two firms looks rather small compared to everything that happened afterwards: the decapitation of online tutoring, new restrictions on video games, anti-monopoly actions against internet platforms, and passage of statutes governing data and privacy. No small number of commentators have pointed out that any individual regulation passes muster on technocratic grounds. The US and Europe after all are debating rules with similar shapes\u2014although they would never implement them with China\u2019s speed and severity. I agree both with the commentators who see a sound technocratic foundation for these rules as well as with commentators like Naughton who note that they add up to an unprecedented new program of political control on firms. Beijing expects companies to comply not only with formal regulations but also to a broader ideological agenda. We will see how much US regulation of internet companies also forces conformity with an ideological agenda.\u00a0 Hong Kong is no longer Milton Friedman's free market paradise:\u00a0 ... Hong Kong was also the most bureaucratic city I\u2019ve ever lived in. Its business landscape has remained static for decades: the preserve of property developers that has created no noteworthy companies in the last three decades. That is a heritage of British colonial rule, in which administrators controlled economic elites by allocating land\u2014the city\u2019s most scarce resource\u2014to the more docile. Hong Kong bureaucrats enforce the pettiest rules, I felt, out of a sense of pride. On the mainland, enforcers deal often enough with senseless rules that they are sometimes able to look the other way. Thus a stagnant spirit hangs over the city. ...Beijing locals have adapted to the proliferation of rules not with complete obedience, but discernment of which can be safely ignored.\u00a0 Chinese exports, brands, and quality:\u00a0 Chinese firms have not created many global brands, but I have confidence that will change. Entrepreneurs are still full of big dreams, having failed to receive the memo that globalization is dead. Those who sense foreign hostility towards China would keep their identity quiet, with the hope that the product quality will speak for itself.

A little reader skepticism would be a good habit in all cases.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As for the second essay pointed out by Bari Weiss (Walter Kim's essay):I am sorry to say, but that is nothing new. Whatever you may think of him, Mark Levin has a book called \"Unfreedom of the Press\", published way before Kim's essay. In general, I agree with the thrust of this post.There is also the matter of $6 trillion spent in counterproductive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.No one plans a military invasion of the U.S. Yet Washington outlays $1.4 trillion annually in defense costs (DoD, VA, DHS, black budget, pro-rated interest on the national debt). That is about $4200 for every man, woman, child and trans in the country, or almost $17,000 for a family of four.$17,000! And next year, and the year after that and into perpetuity will be even more.Reform?  Alas, no, no, no. This is a lament, a garbage lament.\"Since the US government is incapable of structural reform ... \"Christ almighty, that's how it was designed. Do a reform and get a civil war, one on each issue.And, yes, the media here are different. There is more than one.None of us need agree. It's variety, competition, and free choice that matter. And we still have it. The essay was interesting, but how much of it is credible and how much falls into the incredible category?  \"A strong state, a strong civil society, and a strong scientific / technocratic establishment are  ones that allow and responds to criticism that deviates from The Narrative. Here and in China.\"--this is a fallacy.  You won't find the \"allow...deviates from the 'The Narrative'\"; but, you'll have plenty of \"responds to criticism that deviates from 'The Narrative'\", as in disappearing the deviates.  \"A strong scientific/technocratic establishment\" is a oligarchy of technocrats that set the norms and mores for those they admit to the establishment (guild-like).  The admonition today is \"Follow the Science!\"  It gets worse with the passage of time.  Phrases such as \"Climate Crisis\", \"Climate Change Emergency!\", etc., are intended to buffalo the unwary, the ignorant and the gulible.  It's succeeding.Dan Wong's essay describes some of the nature of that technocratic/scientific, strong state, etc., apparatus.  He doesn't touch on the more controversial aspects of that social order which have been described in the western press.  It's a totalist state, and as was demonstrated by the example made of Jack Ma, it has a long arm and it is willing to take arbitrary measures to rein in activities that do not conform to the established norms and mores of the state leadership.In the USA, we see a concerted effort guided by a handful of senators to overturn established order in the regulatory agencies governing the US financial sector.  It's a mini version of the totalist state control that pervades the PRC.  It's succeeding because no one, as yet, has mounted a concentrated response to counter it.Be careful what you wish for--you may get more of it than you bargained. Wang's arguments are just terrible. It is obvious why it appeared in the Atlantic. \"....oft-times after failing \u201cfact-checks\u201d by the friendly people at Good Thoughtkeeping.\"Perfect! \n\n\nComments are welcome.

From its inflection point in February 2021 to last month, the US consumer price index has grown 6% \u2013 an 8% annualized rate.&nbsp;</p><p>The underlying cause is no mystery. Starting in March 2020, the US government created about $3 trillion of new bank reserves (an equivalent to cash) and sent checks to people and businesses. The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so and sent even more checks. The total stimulus comes to about 25% of GDP, and to around 30% of the original federal debt. While much of the money went to help people and businesses severely hurt by the pandemic, much of it was also sent regardless of need, intended as stimulus (or \u201caccommodation\u201d) to stoke demand. The goal was to induce people to spend, and that is what they are now doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Milton Friedman once said that if you want inflation, you can just drop money from helicopters. That is basically what the US government has done. But this US inflation is ultimately fiscal, not monetary. People do not have an excess of money relative to bonds; rather, people have extra savings and extra apparent wealth to spend. Had the government borrowed the entire $5 trillion to write the same checks, we likely would have the same inflation.&nbsp;</p><p><span></span></p><a name=\"more\"></a>Other purported factors \u2013 including \u201csupply shocks,\u201d \u201cbottlenecks,\u201d \u201cdemand shifts,\u201d and corporate \u201cgreed\u201d \u2013 are not relevant to the overall price level. The ports would not be clogged if people were not trying to buy lots of goods. If people wanted more TVs and fewer restaurant meals, the price of TVs would go up and the price of restaurant meals would go down. Greed did not suddenly break out last year.&nbsp;<p></p><p>By contrast, inflation, when all prices and wages rise together, comes from the balance of overall supply and demand. The economy\u2019s capacity to produce goods and services turns out to be lower than expected. Here, the labor shortage \u2013 the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d \u2013 is a key underlying fact.

        "text": "John Cochrane's blog This is part of an ongoing series of essays on inflation. \u00a0This one is at Project Syndicate. The next post is somewhat longer and more academic with the same themes.\u00a0 The Ghost of Christmas Inflation Inflation continues to surge. From its inflection point in February 2021 to last month, the US consumer price index has grown 6% \u2013 an 8% annualized rate.\u00a0 The underlying cause is no mystery. Starting in March 2020, the US government created about $3 trillion of new bank reserves (an equivalent to cash) and sent checks to people and businesses. The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so and sent even more checks. The total stimulus comes to about 25% of GDP, and to around 30% of the original federal debt. While much of the money went to help people and businesses severely hurt by the pandemic, much of it was also sent regardless of need, intended as stimulus (or \u201caccommodation\u201d) to stoke demand. The goal was to induce people to spend, and that is what they are now doing.\u00a0 Milton Friedman once said that if you want inflation, you can just drop money from helicopters. That is basically what the US government has done. But this US inflation is ultimately fiscal, not monetary. People do not have an excess of money relative to bonds; rather, people have extra savings and extra apparent wealth to spend. Had the government borrowed the entire $5 trillion to write the same checks, we likely would have the same inflation.\u00a0   By contrast, inflation, when all prices and wages rise together, comes from the balance of overall supply and demand. The economy\u2019s capacity to produce goods and services turns out to be lower than expected. Here, the labor shortage \u2013 the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d \u2013 is a key underlying fact. Employers can\u2019t find people to work because many people remain on the sidelines, not even looking for jobs.\u00a0 The US Federal Reserve was completely surprised by the surge of inflation, and through most of the year insisted it would be \u201ctransitory,\u201d and go away on its own. That turned out to be a major institutional failure. Is it not the Fed\u2019s main job to understand the economy\u2019s supply capacity and fill \u2013 but not overfill \u2013 the cup of demand?\u00a0 One might expect that among the thousands of economists the Fed employs, there is a group working on figuring out ports\u2019 capacity, the effects of microchip shortages, how many people have retired or are not returning to work, and so forth. One would be disappointed. Central banks have sketchy ideas of supply, mostly centered on statistical trends in labor markets.\u00a0 Why did this fiscal stimulus produce inflation when previous stimulus efforts from 2008 to 2020 fizzled? There are several obvious possibilities. First, this stimulus was much bigger. Former US Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers correctly prophesied inflation in March [Update: February] 2021 by simply looking at the immense size of the spending packages, relative to any reasonable estimate of the GDP shortfall.\u00a0 Second, officials misunderstood the COVID recession.

Given supply constraints from regulations, labor laws, and disincentives created by social programs, potential solutions here should be obvious.\u00a0 ***** A somewhat longer piece on the same themes is on its way, with documentation of the numbers and more explanation. The points here are also covered in more detail in the \"covid inflation\" chapter of Fiscal Theory of the Price Level. \u00a0  What is your explanation for low interest rates on government securities?  If people are not convinced that the government will run surpluses in the future to repay debts, why are they holding the bonds? The Federal Reserve is the catalyst behind the ultra-low rates by monetizing the debt issued by treasuries. A good person to follow on this is @robinbrooksiif on twitter, the fed's holding of gov debt since GFC has skyrocketed while foreign ownership has plummeted. So it's not that \"people\" are willing to hold negative bearing gov bonds, it's the FED has stepped in at all costs to ensure the debt gets held, pushing down rates in the process. The bond market is predicting a recession  Treasury yields price the Fed reaction function - nothing more. I don't think it is entirely relevant whether fiscal policy or monetary policy is the more powerful driver.  We have received double-barreled stimulus on both fronts.In normal times it is the job of the central bank to do the fine tuning.  If fiscal stimulus is excessive, the Fed can be restrictive.  But, these are not normal times.  But, it does feel like the central bankers are asleep.Given the number of times I have tried to buy something in the last 18 months and found that it is simply not available anywhere at any price, I am surprised we have not seen more inflation already. \"If people believe that less of the debt expansion will be repaid, then the price level will continue to rise, as much as 30%.\" As much as 30% if you think there won't be other X-trillion-dollar packages... These deficits might be changing peoples' perception of future deficits too.I'm afraid what you are doing over there in the US will soon arrive around here  \"Had the government borrowed the entire $5 trillion to write the same checks, we likely would have the same inflation.\"As MIT '84, this troubles me. It's the new theory, I know. And it isn't willingness to hold money vs. bonds that's driving things. But is it maybe debt that will be repaid vs. debt that will not? The Chinese aren't buying debt now. Nor are Americans. Just the Fed, the buyer of last resort.  This is a deep comment, which I've been thinking about for a while. The next essays will have more of this. If reserves are debt people do not think will be repaid and treasury debt is debt people think will be repaid, that makes a big difference.  This comment has been removed by the author. Do you have any falsifiable inflation predictions? Are we in for a 30% price level increase? More? Less?Personally, I've been more convinced so far by the tilt toward goods from services explaining a great deal of the inflation we've seen. As such, I suppose I'd be on team transitory with a baseline expectation that inflation will normalize to the acceptable sub 4% range over the next year. What are your expectations? Fundamentally, inflation breaks out when people do not think the government will repay all its debts by eventually running fiscal surpluses.--John CochraneI dunno. Suppose I sell hot dogs from stand, $1 each. Things are in balance, I sell out by the end of the day, and my cart holds only 100 hot dogs.  Then, demand starts to creep up. I start to sell out before the end of the day. So, I take advantage and raise prices, and get back into balance.Vice-versa, if I can afford to accept a lower price.   When do I ponder Federal Reserve policy or government deficits? Don't I set prices daily based on demand? Also, if the Fed buys up a large amount of Treasuries...then are people assured the federal government can meet debt payments? After all, the interest payments on the Fed-owned Treasuries flow back into the Treasury. Japan?  But why did demand for your hot dogs go up? Maybe people want fewer hamburgers? OK, but then the price of hamburgers goes down. How can people possibly spend more money on everything, to drive up the price of everything? Only if people are trying to get rid of money, and government debt in general. Aggregate demand is not demand, inflation is not a relative price change.  Both Hot Dogs and Hamburgers \u201coriginate\u201d with the same livestock,, more or less.Reasonable to assume that the Hamburger Guys are low on supply too, and, of course raising prices\u2026My fear, being realized more and more every day, is that ~10% inflation is already baked-in across the board. This comment has been removed by the author. The price of everything can be driven up if the supply of everything is driven down. Imagine an isolated economy where some natural disaster destroys 10% of  all business facilities of every kind:  supply would go down and prices would go up.  In this case facilities weren't destroyed: but lockdowns, reduced production and widespread supply chain disruptions and the price of widely used commodities like oil rose and widely drove up the price of other things. Fiscal stimulus led some people to have more funds to spend to allow prices in general to rise rather than merely leading some prices to fall while others rose.The blog post said: \"If people wanted more TVs and fewer restaurant meals, the price of TVs would go up and the price of restaurant meals would go down.\"Except its more complicated than that: since covid led to people staying home more and buying goods for home use (I hadn't checked on whether TVs were included) and fewer meals out. However: even if competition would normally tend then to drive down restaurant meal prices, other factors like cost to comply with covid restrictions, reduced occupancy allowed, and worker shortages or workers demanding essentially a hazard pay premium for such jobs worked against that and applied to all the industry participants.The pandemic decimated small businesses: oddly I hadn't seen good data on that since relief programs did temporarily keep some afloat and there are supposedly a rise in some new businesses but I hadn't checked data (many I suspect are just individuals  who went freelance when unemployed,  either to actually get income or to collect the new unemployment for freelancers). Decimating small businesses led to less competition for some niches and more ability temporarily for oligopolies to increase prices in some niches or resist decreases in others. Oddly people talk about the high profits in some public companies: but thats a misleading picture since smaller companies are a different story. It is true that some  large companies benefited from the decimation of smaller ones, and of course some profited from the pandemic increasing demand for some things.  However also: companies with hope for the future often reinvest revenue into expansion rather than taking a profit. Sometimes profit taking means they  are \"saving for a rainy day\" rather than investing in expansion or fixing supply chain issues, etc. Small companies are likely doing the same. The production capacity needs to shift to deal with the shift in demand to restrain price increases: and that requires capital being spent, often borrowed capital.Yet last I checked (AIER had a post about it) bank lending hasn't recovered, or last I checked investment is still not up to where it should be even though the shift in demand and the decimated businesses should require capital to rebuild and fix the supply chain mess.  Again by analogy: picture it like a natural disaster physically destroyed 10% of business facilities and they needed to be rebuilt: capital would be needed. Of course instead: the government wants to take resources and focus on its programs rather than letting the private sector rebuild itself. Risk averse investors from overseas will turn to treasuries and keep those interest rates low, while not enough capital flows in to where its needed to rebuild which is more risky with an unpredictable pandemic going on and the economic situation uncertain. Investors that do take risks tend to be partly distracted with the \"everything bubbles\", stock prices detached from fundamentals, crypto, etc. \"Given supply constraints from regulations, labor laws, and disincentives created by social programs, potential solutions here should be obvious.\"I'm no Marxist, but I do believe in equitable compensation and treatment of labor.So, I'm curious: which ones do we get rid of?My old classes in Labor History point to a reality that when firms and labor play nice, there are productivity gains to be earned and shared, for it reduces churn, helps morale, and builds trust. Is it really a one time helicopter drop if the government is running primary deficits financed by the FED? Its not as if the US has been comitted to 0 debt growth this whole time and the share of the debt being paid by borrowed funds appears to be shrinking.  Excellent analysis as usual. Would be helpful if the writer were to address the failure of TIPS and longs bonds to price this in.  This comment has been removed by the author. \"If fiscal inflation does erupt, containing it will be difficult . . . with the debt-to-GDP ratio above 100%\"Agreed! Since 1800, 51 out of 52 countries with gross government debt greater than 130% have defaulted, either through restructuring, devaluation, high inflation or outright default. The US crossed that threshold in 2020 and thus seems highly likely to default through sustained high inflation.See pages 3 and 6 of this letter: https://tinyurl.com/bdftm3xn Consider a more intricate alternative theory.  Covid shocks induce a switch of demand from services to goods. The price of goods rises, but the price of services may not decline as easily as suggested. A goods producer facing slack demand will see inventories build up and need to reduce prices to get rid of excess inventory. But a service producer facing slack demand does not see a corresponding inventory build up.  An Uber driver who finds no passengers does not find the next day that his ride inventory has built up. Disney and American Airlines do not accumulate an inventory of unsold tickets. Further, the main cost of most services is labor, and as noted by Dr. Cochrane, labor is becoming more expensive and difficult to find due to government policy. If price is near marginal cost, service providers may even increase prices to compensate for higher labor costs and make due with far lower demand.  Growth in money supply is not required, but the theory predicts we see inflation in the goods sector, lower real GDP in the services sector, overall nominal GDP is unchanged, overall real GDP is lower, and higher overall inflation.    I find this to be a compelling argument. Would be interested to hear the author's rebuttal. Downwardly sticky prices in service industries. Possible, but it means those prices decline eventually, and inflation does not just go away, inflation reverses and we get back to the old price level. That does not seem to be in the cards. BTW, I get 1000 words and used 998, so I can't treat every possible complication.  Sorry, but I think the logic here is flawed. \"But a service producer facing slack demand does not see a corresponding inventory build up.\"Actually service providers will find their are \"building up\" time sitting idle. A consultant will find less billable hours, an uber driver sitting in the car idle, etc. Prices may or may not be sticky, but the reason they are or are not is independent of whether it's a physical good or a service.\"Uber driver who finds no passengers does not find the next day that his ride inventory has built up. Disney and American Airlines do not accumulate an inventory of unsold tickets.\"Again, this might be an argument for how a supply chain is affected (bull whip effect, etc.) but the behavioral/economic implication is no different.  The marginal cost of additional hours or the same seat on a flight remaining empty day after day increases with time.IMHO, good economic modelling recognizes that individuals only value services, not goods themselves (they value the services derived from the physical goods), and we should think in terms of marginal benefits and marginal costs.  There's no fundamental economic analysis difference between the service industry and the goods industry.  Once you recognize the \"goods\" themselves are fundamentally again just inputs to a technology providing the services individuals are actually deriving utility from then it's exactly the same in every regard. The empty seat on a place is the good unsold and so is the hamburger cooked but not sold. Both are inputs to a final service, unsold.  The burger has a higher depreciation rate of course (and other \"goods\" might have lower depreciation rates), but otherwise the same. Travel services clearly saw downward price adjustments in the face of less demand. I don't think inventory levels is the driver of firm behavior - I think demand is. \n\n\nComments are welcome.

Days after bolstering the offensive line with the free-agent signings of guard Connor Williams and tackle Terron Armstead, Miami added another offensive weapon to its receiving corps in Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill. The Dolphins sent a massive haul of draft picks to the Chiefs while also extending his contract to make him the highest-paid receiver in the league. Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Dolphins are sending their first-, second- and fourth-round 2022 draft picks \u2014 plus their fourth- and-sixth-round 2023 draft picks \u2014 for Hill. Moreover, they're reportedly giving him a four-year extension that will make him the highest-paid receiver in the league, just days after Davante Adams earned that moniker in a trade to the Raiders.

Here's how much the 28-year-old stands to make with the Dolphins: Schefter \u2014 citing Hill's agent, Drew Rosenhaus \u2014 reports the Dolphins are extending Hill another four years on top of his guaranteed $18.34 million due in 2022. They're paying him $120 million over the duration of the extension, which includes a guarantee of $72.2 million. Per Spotrac.com, Hill's contract guarantees $53.4 million guaranteed at signing, plus another $19.6 million guaranteed as of March 2023. The new contract will keep Hill in Miami through the end of the 2026 season, at which point he will be 32 years old. Dolphins are giving their new WR Tyreek Hill a 4-year, $120 million extension, including $72.2 million guaranteed, per \u2066@DrewJRosenhaus\u2069. pic.twitter.com/rkSWmAOOMt The duration of Hill's extension also makes him the highest-paid receiver in the history of the league, both in terms of annual salary ($30 million) and guaranteed value ($72.2 million). Adams previously held those records ($28.5 million and $67.5 million, respectively). That said, Adams' overall contract value with the Raiders ($141.3 million) is still the highest of any non-quarterback in the history of the league.

The Chiefs reportedly offered Hill such a deal, per Ian Rapoport, though talks stalled to the point that Hill sought a trade. Hill immediately settled on two destinations: New York, or Miami, before settling with the Dolphins. There, he will join a skill position group that includes receivers Jaylen Waddle and (for now) Davante Parker, tight end Mike Gesicki and running backs Raheem Mostert and Chase Edmunds. Hill is now the highest-paid receiver in the league in terms of annual value:"

Both Hill and Waddle have game-breaking speed, so it will be difficult for opposing defenses to consistently contain both. Sure, the team's weapons may be a bit small \u2014 both receivers stand at 5-10 \u2014 but they can separate from defensive backs. That's what matters most.

That was good for the fourth-lowest among qualified NFL passers, ahead of just Andy Dalton, Ben Roethlisberger and Jared Goff. If Tagovailoa continues to throw the ball underneath, Hill will at least be able to rack up some yards after the catch to keep the chains moving for the Dolphins. That will make him a nice fit for the style of offense with which Miami is most comfortable. Mike McDaniel will also be free to get the ball in Hill's hands in a variety of ways, much like he did with Deebo Samuel last season for the 49ers. With Hill's fit looking strong, why is this grade only getting a B-? For one, Tagovailoa hasn't shown a consistent ability \u2014 or willingness \u2014 to throw deep passes. That could limit Hill's deep-threat ability which happens to be one of his greatest strengths. Additionally, surrendering five draft picks, including two top-50 picks in a very deep draft, is less than ideal. After all, Miami still has holes to fill before it can be a contender in the loaded AFC. Also, the Dolphins had to not only give up five draft picks to get Hill, but they also had to make him the NFL's highest-paid receiver. He is now set to make $120 million over four years with $72.2 million guaranteed, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Hill is worth that type of contract, at least for now. But between that agreement and the draft picks that Miami surrendered to land him, the Dolphins are paying\u00a0a lot\u00a0for Hill. Will it pan out? It sure could. But does this make them a contender in the AFC? Probably not, barring a massive step forward from Tagovailoa. I don't know if I'd have done what the Dolphins just did ... but the idea of Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle is TERRIFYING. Terron Armstead should help them move their young linemen into the right places.\n\nAnd at the very least, they should KNOW on Tua Tagovailoa a year from now. MORE:\u00a0Why the Colts are the winners of the Matt Ryan trade Let's be clear: The Chiefs got A HAUL\u00a0for Hill. They will be able to add plenty of depth and talent to their roster via the draft capital they received from the Dolphins. They well could find a replacement for Hill with either the first- or second-round draft pick they received in the trade. However, there's still no denying that the Chiefs are worse off without Hill. He accounted for 25 percent of their receiving yards last season and led the team with 111 catches. No other wide receiver had more than 59 (Mecole Hardman). Replacing that production, and the years of chemistry built with QB Patrick Mahomes, would be difficult enough without other losses in the receiving corps. Byron Pringle and Demarcus Robinson signed with the Bears and Raiders respectively this offseason, so only Hardman remains among the Chiefs' top four receivers from 2021, in terms of snaps played. The Chiefs brought in JuJu Smith-Schuster as a free agent, but he was expected to be the No. 2 receiver for the team. Instead, he is now the No. 1 option, a spot at which he has struggled in recent years. So, needless to say, Kansas City's receiving corps is thin and it needs to add a true No. 1 playmaker to help take pressure off Smith-Schuster and Travis Kelce. Mahomes will have the ability to elevate the play of some of his receivers, but make no mistake: The Chiefs got worse by trading Hill. Maybe he won't live up to the contract that the Dolphins paid him, but losing him creates a big hole on the Chiefs' offense. That could hinder their chances of reaching the Super Bowl, given the loaded nature of both the AFC and their division, the AFC West."

        "text": "Cheetahs are now native to South Beach. On Wednesday, the Chiefs and Dolphins came together on the NFL's latest blockbuster deal, with Kansas City shipping wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Dolphins for a huge package of picks. On top of the trade, Hill is reportedly signing a brand-new contract that makes him one of the highest paid players in football and the highest-paid receiver on average annual value in his new deal. ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the Dolphins and the Jets were both the finalists in the Hill sweepstakes hours before the trade went down. At the end of the day, it was Hill's choice to make, meaning he ultimately decided to take his talents to South Beach. Here's how the deal broke down: On March 23, the Chiefs and Dolphins agreed to a deal that would send Hill and his talents to Miami for a massive package of picks, and a new contract. It's unclear what the Jets' package for Hill was, but reports suggested that New York offered a similar package which equaled the value of the picks offered by Miami. NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reports that the Jets' offer included both of their 2022 second-round picks, at No. 35 and No. 38. Chiefs are trading six-time Pro-Bowl WR Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins for five draft picks: a 2022 1st-round pick (No. 29), a 2nd-round pick (No. 50) and a 4th-round pick, as well as 4th- and 6th-round picks in the 2023 draft, sources tell ESPN. Jets trade offer to the Chiefs for Tyreek Hill - that Kansas City would have accepted if the WR opted for NY - did not include a first-round pick, but rather multiple picks that were commensurate to the Dolphins\u2019 offer based on the draft value chart that teams use, per sources. In addition to the picks, Hill received a massive contract extension, which is what led to the trade away from Kansas City to begin with. The Dolphins are inking Hill to a four-year, $120 million extension, with $72.2 million in guarantees, per reports. That new contract, coupled with the lack of income tax in Florida (and sunshine), may have ultimately pushed Hill's decision. The likely deciding factor for Hill accepting a trade to Miami is twofold: Hill spends his offseasons there, as well as the massive contract extension he received \u2014 the no income tax thing in Florida certainly helps."

        "text": "\"With the first pick in the 2022 NHL Draft ...\" We're just a few months away from hearing those exciting words from NHL commissioner Gary Bettman.\u00a0 Believe it or not, we're slowly approaching the end of the NHL season, with teams playing the final quarter of their schedule. For a good portion of the league, the Stanley Cup is still the goal, but for the bottom-dwellers in the league, the next marquee event on the schedule is the NHL Draft.\u00a0 With the CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game going on tonight, it's a prime opportunity for scouts to get a deeper look as the best of the Canadian junior hockey players go head-to-head.\u00a0There is a high likelihood that most of the names participating will be called in July at the NHL Draft, marking the beginning of the next step in their hockey career.\u00a0 Here is everything you need to know ahead of the 2022 NHL Draft.\u00a0 MORE:\u00a0When is the 2022 NHL Draft lottery? Date, time, TV channel, odds for the No. 1 pick drawing The draft spans the course of two days. On Thursday, July 7, the first round will take place, with representatives from all teams selecting with the first 32 picks in Montreal.\u00a0 On Friday, July 8, the remaining picks in Rounds 2-7 will be selected.\u00a0 The Bell Centre, the home of the Montreal Canadiens, will be the location of the 2022 NHL Draft.\u00a0 This is the first time since 2009 that Montreal will host the draft. In total, it is the 27th time the city has been the home of the annual event. Montreal was supposed to host the draft in 2020, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic the event was held virtually for health and safety reasons.\u00a0 MORE:\u00a0CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game 2022: Date, time, TV channel to watch top junior players While the channel for Day 2 of the NHL Draft is not known yet, the first round of the draft will be on national TV on that Thursday.\u00a0 For American viewers, it will be aired on either ESPN or ESPN2, and you can stream it with ESPN+. For the Canadian audience, it will be on Sportsnet, as well as TVA Sports in French.\u00a0 This year's class is expected to be a weaker one. But that doesn't mean there isn't loads of talent to be taken in the first round.\u00a0 Shane Wright has been the consensus No. 1 pick for a couple of seasons. The talented forward from the OHL's Kingston Frontenacs has recorded 143 points in 110 games so far as a member of the team.\u00a0 However, after Wright, there is no clear-cut answer at No. 2 and beyond. There are a number of skilled players coming out of Slovakia, such as Juraj Slafkovsky and Simon Nemec, as well as Finland with Brad Lambert and Joakim Kemell. And, of course, the U.S. and Canada will have a plethora of representatives taken, with Logan Cooley, Matthew Savoie and Conor Geekie projected to be top-10 picks.\u00a0 Here is a look at the top-10 ranked players each from North American and Europe, according to NHL's Central Scouting.\u00a0 \u00a0 Who gets the No. 1 has yet to be determined. The regular season has to conclude before the draft lottery takes place.\u00a0 Teams that finish at the bottom of the rankings have a good shot. In fact, any team that, in reverse order of the standings, is No. 1-No. 11 has a chance at winning the top draft pick.\u00a0 Currently, the Kraken, Canadiens and Coyotes are the three teams in prime position to finish with the best odds of getting the top pick. The trio have been bottom-dwellers for the entirety of the 2021-22 season and there is a good chance that one of those three will be selecting Shane Wright come July.\u00a0 The draft was first created for the 1963 NHL season. This will be the 60th draft in the history of the NHL.\u00a0 The Canadiens have made the most No. 1 picks with five. The Ducks, Canucks, Wild, Hurricanes, Predators, Sharks, Flames and Kraken have never received the first pick in the draft.\u00a0 Here is a look at which teams got the No. 1 picks from the last 10 drafts and who they selected.\u00a0"

        "description": "The 10 biggest footballing superstars set to miss out on the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.",
        "text": "The World Cup is an international showcase of the best footballers on the planet with Qatar 2022 tipped as a unique challenge for all involved. The spectacle of a winter tournament has generated huge attention, with the demands it places on European domestic seasons causing controversy, after FIFA stuck to their guns of bringing the competition to the Middle East. However, despite the focus on the nations and stars on display in Qatar, there will be some huge names missing out, after failing to secure a place with their national sides. Eric Cantona, George Weah, Ryan Giggs, George Best and Alfredo Di Stefano are amongst the names to have infamously never played in a World Cup, and 2022 will add more names to an inglorious list. Haaland's goal scoring exploits have made him one of most sought-after players in Europe, with a scramble for his signature set to burst into life this summer. However, despite scoring five goals in qualifying, Norway were edged out in UEFA Group G, as Turkey claimed second place behind the Netherlands. Aubameyang hit the headlines in 2022 after joining Barcelona on a free transfer following his high-profile exit from Arsenal. However, despite netting two crucial goals in qualifying, Gabon were squeezed out by Mo Salah's Egypt in the race for a CAF play-off spot. AC Milan midfielder Kessie looks set for a crucial few months at the San Siro, as his contract with Stefano Pioli's side expires at the end of the season. However, regardless of his next club move, he will not be at the World Cup after Ivory Coast suffered a final group game defeat to Cameroon, with the Indomitable Lions progressing in their place. Odegaard has established himself as a key player in Mikel Arteta's Arsenal side after making a permanent switch to North London at the start of 2021/22. But despite assuming the role of Norway captain in 2021, he was unable to inspire St\u00e5le Solbakken's side, and the former Real Madrid star will be watching the World Cup at home, alongside Haaland. Veteran striker Dzeko is enjoying a seemingly never-ending Indian summer in Serie A as his aims to fill the Romleu Lukaku void at Inter Milan this season. Bosnia's World Cup qualification chances were hampered by a tough group stage draw alongside France and Ukraine, and their skipper, record goal scorer and top appearance maker, could call time on his international career before Euro 2024. Crystal Palace winger Zaha is another Ivorian who will not be at the World Cup in 2022, as Patrice Beaumelle's side miss out on another tournament, after qualifying for three successive World Cups between 2006 and 2014. Newcastle United winger Almiron misses out on World Cup duty in 2022 with Paraguay's qualification fate already decided in CONEMBOL. Despite the South American section still having two qualifiers to play in 2022, Almiron and Paraguay will only be battling for pride against Ecuador and Peru next month. With Salah and Sadio Mane set for a Liverpool themed World Cup play off in March, in a replay of the AFCON final, fellow Reds star Keita has already seen his World Cup dream ended with Guinea failing to win a game in the second round of qualifiers. Despite being a regular goal scorer in the MLS, Almiron's former Atalanta United teammate Martinez was unable to inspire Venezuela, with just one goal in CONEMBOL qualifying, as Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman's side currently sit bottom of the standings. Haller joins Zaha and Kessie in missing out for Ivory Coast in 2022, despite his two goals in their 2-1 win over Cameroon in September, but his impressive form with Ajax could mean a strong run in the Champions League in 2022."

NBA LEAGUE PASS: Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial) Fittingly, as the NBA celebrates its 75th anniversary, some of the league\u2019s most iconic figures have had their hand in the ongoing history of prolific performances, with each showcase taking a life of its own: We\u2019ve become accustomed to seeing\u00a0Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and LeBron James getting 50 over the last 10-plus years. When Jayson Tatum or Karl-Anthony Towns do it, it gives us a glimpse of what we'll see for the next 10-plus years.

MORE:\u00a0LeBron James, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo entrenched in historic race for scoring title In any other month, these performances would have dominated most basketball discussions, but because of March Madness, NBA history being made in real-time has understandably been a subtext, but it\u2019s certainly worth a closer look. While no two 50-point games are alike, there are a few common threads that tie these performances in March together. And no, it's not simply \"poor defense.\" While Kyrie's efficiency was video-game-like, it's worth noting that each of the 50-point scorers shoot at least 50 percent from the field, with six performances coming at or above 61.3 percent shooting from the field. To take it a step further, Durant's 37 attempts were the most among the 50-point scorers in March. By The Numbers: Kevin Durant goes off for 53 points in Nets win over Knicks A combination of good shot selection and players getting into\u00a0that\u00a0zone is the best explanation for such efficiency from the field. That, and taking care of business at the charity stripe, where each player sank at least seven freebies. Bey's 7 of 10 shooting from the line was the worst among all performers. You don't need analytics to know that 3 is greater than 2, and each of these performances proved that one way or another. Bey's 51-point outburst was largely a product of his shooting 10 of 14 from the field, while Durant's 37 attempts for 53 points can be traced to his shooting 4 of 13 from deep. Related: Durant going 15 of 24 from inside the arc reinforces the fact that he is the league's most lethal midrange scorer. \ud83d\udd25 53 PTS | 6 REB | 9 AST | 2 STL \ud83d\udd25@KDTrey5 was OTHER-WORLDLY in Brooklyn, dropping a season-high 53 points including 13 in the 4th-quarter to secure the win! #NetsWorld pic.twitter.com/bSAktwdxtu While Bey and Durant were on opposite ends of the spectrum, James knocked down six triples in each of his 50-point performances, Towns drained seven in his 60-point game and Tatum sank eight 3s en route to scoring 54 against the Nets. As for Irving, it was nine 3s that led to 50 in Charlotte and eight 3s that resulted in 50 in Orlando. Speaking of Orlando\u2026 Is it something about the rims at Orlando's Amway Center? The Magic, who undoubtedly have a bright future with their young core, end up on the wrong side of history as they allowed the career performances of Irving and Bey in consecutive home games. Four of the 17 games of 50 points or more in the 2021-22 NBA season have come against Orlando, two of which came on the team's home floor.\u00a0 While it seems like a few of these games have gone under the radar, it somehow also feels like fans are on the edge of their seats, waiting for the next 50-point performance to come. Christian Wood seemingly had an out-of-body experience and drained eight 3s, but it only resulted in 39 points. Trae Young again embraced the villain role at Madison Square Garden but fell five points shy of the third 50-point game of his career. MORE:\u00a0Trae Young says \"it wasn't even that loud\" after 45-point performance at MSG Could it be someone like Devin Booker, who once scored 70 points in the month of March? One of the league's other scoring leaders in Giannis Antetokounmpo or Joel Embiid? Or could we see one of the six names that have already made their mark in March 2022 do it once again? Whether or not it comes at the end of this remains to be seen, but the beauty of the league is that there are a number of worthy candidates to get the job done, some of whom you might not expect."

        "description": "Where could Tyreek Hill end up if the Chiefs trade him? There are a few good landing spots, including the two reported finalists for his services.",
        "text": "Tyreek Hill has long been the top weapon for Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. However, the 28-year-old receiver's time in Kansas City may be coming to an end. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported on Wednesday that the Chiefs have given Hill permission to seek a trade. The decision stems from their inability to agree on a long-term extension with Hill. Another blockbuster coming? Despite an offer from the #Chiefs that would make superstar Tyreek Hill one of the highest-paid receivers, extension talks have stalled and Kansas City has now given Hill\u2019s agent permission to seek a trade, sources tell me and @TomPelissero. If the two sides are, in fact, unable to agree on a long-term extension, it makes sense that the Chiefs would trade Hill. He is in the final year of his contract and Kansas City can get a \"massive haul\" including a first-round pick for his services, per Rapoport. Hill has posted at least 1,183 receiving yards in four of the last five seasons with the Chiefs. He has made the Pro Bowl in all six of his NFL seasons and is a three-time AP All-Pro first-teamer as a receiver and return man. Hill is still in his prime and is one of the fastest players in the NFL. If he is moved, there will be plenty of suitors for his services, even if it means giving up high-end draft capital and signing him to a long-term extension. The Raiders just did the same thing with Davante Adams, after all. So, where could Hill end up playing next? Here's a look at his top potential landing spots as the wild 2022 NFL offseason continues. MORE:\u00a0What's next for Baker Mayfield, Jimmy G after Matt Ryan trade The Dolphins are one of the two favorites to land Hill at this time, per ESPN's Adam Schefter. Sources: Jets and Dolphins both now have trades in place for the soon-to-be former Chiefs\u2019 WR Tyreek Hill. The question now becomes where Hill wants to become the highest-paid WR in NFL history. Once he decides, the trade is expected to happen; for now, Hill is said to be \u201ctorn.\u201d Miami has spent a good portion of the 2022 NFL offseason building around Tua Tagovailoa. The Dolphins signed two offensive linemen to protect him in Terron Armstead and Connor Williams, but they are still looking for help in the receiving corps. Jaylen Waddle (104 catches, 1,015 yards) had an excellent rookie season, but no other Dolphins wide receiver recorded more than DeVante Parker's 40. Hill would be an immediate upgrade and the combination of his and Waddle's speed could prove tricky for opposing defenses to match. The Dolphins have just $6.6 million in cap space, per OverTheCap.com, but they could restructure contracts on their roster to ensure they have enough space for Hill. The Jets are the other team considered to be among the finalists for Hill, according Schefter. Jets and Dolphins are in serious talks to trade for Chiefs\u2019 WR Tyreek Hill, per league sources. Hill and Chiefs are mulling what to do but Hill\u2019s time in KC looks like it could be coming to an end. The Jets are positioned similarly to the Dolphins in that they have a good starting wide-out of the future in Elijah Moore. He was the only Jets receiver to record more than 500 receiving yards last season and can be trusted as a starter. As for the rest of the unit, Corey Davis has been OK, but hasn't stayed healthy; Braxton Berrios is a solid slot receiver but isn't a game-breaker; and Jamison Crowder left the Jets in free agency to sign with the Bills. New York needs a top receiver to pair with Zach Wilson long-term. Hill would give the Jets that and, along with Moore, he could stretch the field to allow them to take full advantage of Wilson's cannon of an arm. The Jets have $19.5 million in cap space, per OverTheCap.com, so they wouldn't have to do much to fit Hill's one-year contract under the cap. They may have to make one restructure or cut a player, but it won't be hard for the Jets to afford the veteran receiver. IYER: Grading the Deshaun Watson trade for the Browns, Texans While the Dolphins and Jets may be in the lead, we see dark horses emerge in trade talks all the time. It happened just last week when the Browns acquired Deshaun Watson. So, don't count out some other teams emerging as contenders for his services. Howie Roseman has been involved in plenty of trades during his time running the Eagles, so he could get in on the action here. The Eagles have spent consecutive first-round picks on receivers, but while Devonta Smith looked good as a rookie, Jalen Reagor hasn't yet panned out. Hill would give the Eagles the speed they were hoping to get when they drafted Reagor. He would pair well with the well-rounded Smith and give the Eagles' offense explosive scoring ability. The Eagles have $23.1 million in cap space, per OverTheCap.com, so they could trade for Hill without needing to make any roster moves. They also have three first-round picks in the 2022 NFL Draft, so they could put together an intriguing package of picks to land Hill. The Saints opened up $23.1 million in cap space in the hopes of landing Watson. They couldn't do that, but perhaps they can land a solid consolation prize in Hill. New Orleans has long been looking for a receiver to complement Michael Thomas, who has played sparingly over the last two years as a result of a nagging ankle injury. Hill could be a perfect fit. While Thomas is a 6-3 receiver with good route-running skills and excellent hands, Hill is a 5-10 playmaker with electric speed who can make guys miss. Opposing defenses would have to choose which player to double team, and given each's ability to separate, that wouldn't be easy. Jameis Winston was solid in seven starts for the Saints last season and liked taking downfield shots to the Saints' speed receivers like Deonte Harris (now Deonte Harty). Just imagine what he'll be able to do with a deep threat like Hill at his disposal. IYER:\u00a0Grading NFL free agency move from best (Bucs) to worst (Texans) There will naturally be questions about whether some of the NFL's contenders will attempt to trade for Hill. Most notably, the Packers stand out as a team that could use his skill set. However, Green Bay won't be chasing after Hill. The reason for that is simple. The Packers weren't willing to pay Davante Adams as much on a contract as the 29-year-old receiver wanted. As a result, they traded him to the Raiders for first- and second-round picks. In all likelihood, Hill is asking for a deal that will pay him similarly to Adams, as they are, arguably, the two best receivers in the NFL. Green Bay wasn't willing to pay Adams, who had been on the team since 2014, so it's hard to imagine shelling out a similar contract to Hill. The Browns also seem unlikely to trade for Hill. On paper, he'd be a great fit for the team, and they surprisingly have enough cap space ($26 million) to afford him. The issue is that Cleveland doesn't have enough draft capital to pull off a deal. The Browns traded three first-round picks to the Texans in the Watson deal, so unless the Chiefs are willing to wait until 2025 to get a first-round pick, they won't consider the Browns' offer. So, as nice as a Hill and Amari Cooper would be at receiver, the Browns will not be in on Cooper."

They\u2019re not eligible to play at Yankees Stadium (81 games) or in Toronto (nine games) or in Citi Field against the Mets (two games).\u00a0 One of the players widely believed to be unvaccinated is Aaron Judge. And let\u2019s just tell it like it is: If Aaron Judge is only eligible to play in 70 games, the Yankees are not winning the AL East. The division is just too damn tough. And their chances of making the postseason drop significantly, too, even with the extra playoff team. Remember, last year the 91-win Jays and the 90-win Mariners missed the playoffs; under the new format, Toronto would have been in but Seattle still would have missed.\u00a0 So what happens? The simplest thing would be for Judge and the other unvaccinated Yankees to get vaccinated. Then the problem immediately disappears. But other than that, it would take a change in public policy to carve out an exemption for ballplayers, so that the rules that apply to everyone else do not apply to them. It seems unlikely that politicians and health experts will change vaccination mandates because a couple of players don\u2019t want to get the safe and effective vaccination that millions of Americans have.\u00a0 The Yankees open their season at home on April 7 against Boston, so I guess we\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u00a0 The lineup is ridiculous. The rotation is outstanding. Three of their best players are entering their Age 23 or Age 24 seasons: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (23), Bo Bichette (24) and Alek Manoah (24). The mix of youth and still-young veterans is just picture perfect. And yet, we still hear rumors about moves the Jays might make. The biggest one, the one Jays fans are really hoping will happen but are trying not to get too excited about, is the one about Jose Ramirez. It\u2019s a certainty that Cleveland will trade its perennial MVP candidate at some point \u2014 maybe not immediately, but the Guardians are not going to extend him long-term and they\u2019re too smart to just let him walk away as a free agent \u2014 and the Jays have an opening at second base. Well, not so much an opening as a potential to upgrade. Cavan Biggio, the scheduled starter, had an on-base percentage of .368 with 24 homers and 20 stolen bases combined in 2019-20 but struggled last year and opened up the position to consideration.\u00a0 MORE: Trading for Matt Chapman a better move for Jays than signing Freddie Freeman And, yeah, if their infield looks like this in 2022-23 \u2026 1B: Vlad Guerrero Jr\n2B: Jose Ramirez\nSS: Bo Bichette\n3B: Matt Champan \u2026 well, that\u2019s just silly. But it\u2019s possible. The Jays are very motivated to not just make the postseason, but to win the World Series. And this absolutely is a roster capable of doing that. We\u2019ll see whether trading for Matt Chapman was the big deal or just the warm-up.\u00a0 Yes. Of course.\u00a0 Yeah, probably. On one hand, it seems weird to say the BOSTON RED SOX aren\u2019t being talked about enough. On the other hand, find someone picking them to win the division. Hell, find someone picking them to finish second. Go ahead, we\u2019ll wait.\u00a0 Why is that? This is a team that won 92 games in the regular season, made it all the way to Game 6 of the ALCS, brings back pretty much every key piece to last year\u2019s team \u2014 swapping Hunter Renfroe\u2019s bat for Trevor Story\u2019s \u2014 and could easily have six players hit between 25 and 40 home runs. It\u2019s a team with a 25-year-old third baseman (Rafael Devers) coming off a season of 38 homers. It\u2019s a team with youngsters Tanner Houck and Jarren Duran poised to make a huge impact in the bigs in 2022 and a young veteran in Nick Pivetta who seemed to unlock the secret to his success in the 2021 postseason. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Story fits into the equation. The Sox showed last season that they weren\u2019t afraid to take a chance with a big bat at a new position. And bless Kyle Schwarber\u2019s heart, he tried his best to play first base in the heat of a pennant race with a new team. He really did. Here\u2019s what I feel we can say for certain: Trevor Story will be better at second base than Schwarber was at first.\u00a0 Story\u2019s first flip to Bogaerts. Devers, who is behind Bogaerts: \u201cPerfect!\u201d Cora, also in the infield: \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been doing it forever.\u201d pic.twitter.com/F3AiFGMFI1 Maybe this isn\u2019t a spring training-specific topic, but it\u2019s going to be a question all season. Now that the AL has an extra playoff spot \u2014 a third wild-card spot, to go with the three division winners \u2014 it\u2019s certainly possible for the East to take four of the six berths. If the expanded playoff bracket had been in effect last year, that\u2019s what would have happened. And you can bet some fans of AL East teams will be rooting for this to happen, as a way to solidify the division as the best in baseball. I mean, you\u2019re not going to hear \u201cAL EAST! AL EAST!\u201d chants and solidarity like you\u2019d get with SEC football fans. But you\u2019ll get Yankees fans happy for the Red Sox to qualify for the playoffs \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 as long as they immediately get swept and embarrassed once they reach October.\u00a0"

        "description": "Diego Maradona has been removed from the FIFA 22 video game after an image rights dispute, depriving it of one of the most talented and iconic figures in the sport's history.",
        "text": "Argentina legend Diego Maradona has been removed from EA Sports' FIFA 22 video game after a row over image rights. One of the greatest players of all time, Maradona was available to play with as an icon card in FIFA Ultimate Team, while he was also part of the Soccer Aid World XI team in the game. However, he has now had to be removed, although EA expressed hope that he can be added back into the game in the future. When users start the game the following message appears:\u00a0\u201cDue to a third party legal dispute, we must suspend Diego Maradona from appearing in FIFA Ultimate Team Packs, Ultimate Draft and the Soccer Aid World XI team. \u201cAs such, Diego Maradona Icon Items will no longer be made available in Packs, SBCs and FUT Draft, and their price range has been fixed until further notice. \u201cWe share our fans\u2019 disappointment and hope to bring one of football\u2019s greatest icons back in the game at some point in the future.\u201d  The removal of Maradona from FIFA 22 is due to a debate of who owns Maradona's likeness rights, as reported by Videogameschronicle.\u00a0 EA had signed a commercial agreement with Maradona's former manager Stefano Ceci. However, a court decided that Ceci didn't have the legal authority to make such deals. Matias Morla, who is Maradona's lawyer, says that before his death in November 2020 Maradona had granted his image rights to his company Sattvica. However, in March 2021 Sattvica was banned from using Maradona's brands after two of Maradona's daughters filed a dispute. In addition to the situation regarding Maradona, EA Sports have also had issues with licenses for some high-profile clubs. For instance, four Italian teams \u2014 Juventus, Atalanta, AS Roma and Lazio \u2014 all appear in FIFA 22, but they are not referred to by their actual names and do not have official kits and badges in the game. EA Sports also had to remove 17 national teams ahead of FIFA 22, including Switzerland and Ivory Coast.\u00a0 Maradona was one of the icon cards in Ultimate Team. There were four different Maradona cards in the game, rated 91, 95, 97 and 98 out of 100.\u00a0 He was also part of the Soccer Aid World XI which can be used in kick-off matches. "

        "description": "Mayfield clearly doesn't want to be a member of the Browns, but his market isn't exactly booming at the moment.",
        "text": "Baker Mayfield's time will come to an inevitable end in Cleveland in the near future, but could he stay in the AFC North? With former Texans star Deshaun Watson now a member of the Browns, Mayfield is looking for a new team. The market for the 26-year-old isn't exactly booming at the moment, however. MORE: Handing out free agency grades for all 32 NFL teams The Colts acquired Matt Ryan to be their starting QB. The Panthers reportedly aren't interested in Mayfield. The Seahawks could get involved with Russell Wilson gone, though there has been more speculation than solid reporting linking them to Mayfield. So, who's left? Well, what about one of Cleveland's biggest rivals? During an appearance on the \"Orange and Brown Talk\" podcast, Cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot discussed the possibility of Mayfield joining the Steelers if the Browns decide to release him rather than trade him. \"I knew, as of Thursday, that the phone was not ringing off the hook for Baker Mayfield and that this might get a little bit challenging,\" Cabot said. \"I had somebody tell me... that the Steelers will pounce on Baker Mayfield if he becomes available \u2014 like, if they cut him, and he's just out there as a street free agent. They would take him in a minute. \"And I'm sure a lot of people would. I mean, if you can get him for nothing, and the Browns have to eat that money, then certainly somebody would go grab him in that scenario.\"  From the Steelers' perspective, adding a motivated Mayfield to the roster without losing any assets would be a low-risk, high-reward signing. Mayfield has more experience as a starting QB than Mitch Trubisky, Mason Rudolph and Dwayne Haskins, so it's not as though he would be supplanting a Pro Bowler on the depth chart. While Mayfield donning the black-and-gold jersey would make the divisional clashes between Cleveland and Pittsburgh even more intriguing, cutting him should be a last resort for the Browns. In that scenario, they would take on an $18.86 million cap hit. In a trade, they could clear all (or at least some) of his salary from their books. As Cabot notes, the best approach for Cleveland could be to simply wait for a market to develop after the wild run of QB changes this offseason. In the event of an injury during training camp or early in the season, the Browns would have a starter ready to roll."

        "description": "The Falcons \"wanted to do right\" by Matt Ryan during the 2022 NFL offseason. That involved trading him to the Colts.",
        "text": "The Falcons made the decision to move on from Matt Ryan during the 2022 NFL offseason. Atlanta traded its quarterback of 14 years to the Colts on Monday in exchange for a 2022 third-round draft pick. Many assumed that the Falcons' decision was tied directly to their pursuit of Deshaun Watson. Atlanta was among the teams in on the embattled Texans quarterback before he was traded to the Browns last Friday. However, Falcons general manager Terry Fontenot insisted Wednesday that the team's decision to trade Ryan had nothing to do with its pursuit of Watson. It was something the Falcons had been considering all offseason. \"Whether we began to explore Deshaun or not, we were already starting to discuss trading Matt this offseason,\" Fontenot told reporters, per Kelly Price of Fox 5 Sports. MORE: Grading the Matt Ryan trade for the Colts, Falcons The trade wasn't born of tension between the two sides. According to Falcons coach Arthur Smith, the two sides mutually decided that it would be best for each to move on. \"It was very amicable,\" Smith said of the split, per Josh Kendall of The Athletic, \"and we feel like it was a win for both sides, for us long-term and Matt right now.\" Ryan seemed to echo the sentiment. He had nothing but love for Atlanta in a thank you letter he released to the city on Wednesday. Thank you, Atlanta.\n\n- Matt, Sarah, Marshall and Johnny pic.twitter.com/hl0sE1o7A8 Why and how did the two sides reach this agreement? Here's what the Falcons' leadership said about their decision to trade Matt Ryan. MORE:\u00a0Why the Matt Ryan trade could mimic the Colts signing Philip Rivers The logic behind the Falcons' trade was simple. Ryan will turn 37 in May, and Atlanta isn't poised to be a contender in 2022, even with the weakened state of the NFC. The Falcons simply have too many holes on their roster and since Ryan was set to have a massive $49.5 million cap hit, they didn't have the resources needed to fill them. As such, the Falcons opted to go for a mini-rebuild (though Fontenot isn't a fan of that word). They are eating $40.5 million in dead cap space by trading Ryan, but as coach Arthur Smith pointed out, the decision to part with Ryan will give them plenty of extra resources in future seasons. \"It opens up a lot of [salary cap] space in \u201823 so we don\u2019t have to keep playing this game of restructures and minimum deals,\" Smith said of the Ryan trade, per Josh Kendall of The Athletic. \"Part of the compensation is what it opens up in the future for us.\" Indeed, the Falcons are set to have a lot\u00a0of cap space in 2023 \u2014 $106.8 million to be exact, per OverTheCap.com. That will position them to be buyers during that offseason and will allow them to fill whichever holes remain on their roster following the 2022 season. The third-round pick will also help Atlanta to add talent, even if the compensation wasn't as much as many thought the team would get for Ryan. As Fontenot explained, the Falcons were willing to take lower-level compensation to trade Ryan to the Colts. \"It was more important to us to do right by Matt than to try to maximize compensation,\" Fontenot said. \"We could have probably traded Matt to somewhere he didn\u2019t want to be and gotten more. We said, \u2018If we\u2019re going to go down this road, we want to do right by Matt.'\" In the end, they did. Now, Ryan will get a chance to compete for a playoff spot while Atlanta can start its mini-rebuild in earnest. MORE:\u00a0What's next for Baker Mayfield, Jimmy G after Matt Ryan trade The Falcons are going to spend time evaluating the quarterback market. It will mark the first time in 14 years that they have to look, in earnest, for a new signal-caller. Shortly after agreeing to trade Ryan, Atlanta signed Marcus Mariota to a two-year contract. The 28-year-old quarterback was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft and has experience playing for Arthur Smith. Mariota has been a backup since being benched in favor of Ryan Tannehill during the 2019 season. That said, Mariota threw for 26 touchdowns and just nine interceptions in 2016, and Smith believes that he will be a good stopgap option for the team, bare minimum. \"I trust Marcus,\" Smith said, per The Athletic. \"He\u2019s going to come in here and give us everything we\u2019ve got.\" Mariota won't be the only option that the Falcons consider at quarterback. Fontenot says that the team will explore all available options at the position, including the top prospects in the 2022 NFL Draft. \"We\u2019re going to add to the position,\" Fontenot said. \"It could be in the draft. It could be in free agency. It could be in a trade. We\u2019re going to dig into this class, but we\u2019re not going to feel pressured to do anything.\" So, Mariota will have competition. It's just a matter of whether it will be another veteran or a prospect, like Malik Willis or Kenny Pickett."

        "text": "MLB fans will be seeing ghosts in 2022. Those waiting for a return to normalcy in baseball for the first time since the 2019 season will just have to keep waiting: The MLBPA and owners have reached an agreement to keep the controversial automatic runner rule in place for the upcoming season, according to the New York Post. MORE:\u00a0'Shohei Ohtani Rule,\u2019 explained: How MLB\u2019s new CBA will benefit Angels, Ohtani and fans (just maybe not opponents) The rule, which places an automatic (or \"ghost\") runner on second base in extra innings, was introduced to MLB in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, and has remained in the game since then, much to the chagrin of baseball purists. Here's what you need to know about the new and returning rules: While fans are largely opposed to the rule, it's a rare point of agreement between both the players and ownership: Players, managers, the league and team owners are all in favor of it, with the owners expected to vote to approve the rule for the 2022 season. There are a few reasons why: The rule is in place as part of the league's Health and Safety guidelines, which were originally introduced in 2020 for the coronavirus-shortened season. The rule was adopted for the 2021 season and stays for at least 2022. The controversial rule places a runner on second base in extra innings, and MLB has seen a shortening of games that enter extras since the rule was introduced. While fans and purists generally reject the idea, the rule has been accepted by players and managers. \"I know it\u2019s not traditional baseball, but when you\u2019re talking about saving arms, and saving guys for the next day, I think it's good,\" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said (via the USA Today). \"I enjoyed the ghost runner over the last couple of years, I really have. \"It added a certain degree of excitement to the game. It sped up the game. It enabled us to preserve some pitching, and not having to send out guys for the next day because we\u2019re tapped out.\" In addition the the automatic runner in extras, are a few more reported rules that have been introduced for the 2022 season: \u2014 Aptly named the \"Shohei Ohtani Rule,\" this new rule dictates that a pitcher who is also in the lineup as the DH (as Ohtani does) can stay in the game as a DH even after being removed from the game as a pitcher.\u00a0 \u2014 Rosters will be expanded to 28 players, up from 26, for the first month of the season. This accounts for the shortened spring training. \u2014 The return of nine-inning doubleheaders, as opposed to the shortened seven-inning doubleheaders over the last two seasons."

Boyd had surgery in September and should be ready for his season debut sometime in June.\u00a0 12:30 a.m.:\u00a0Freddie Freeman is returning to his native Southern California. The free-agent first baseman agreed to six-year, $162 million contract with the Dodgers late Wednesday/early Thursday, ESPN's Jeff Passan and Kiley McDaniel reported. BREAKING: Freddie Freeman has agreed to terms with the Dodgers on a six-year, $162 million deal according to @JeffPassan and me. Freeman, 32, is going home after the Braves moved on from him earlier in the week. Atlanta acquired first baseman Matt Olson from the A's on Tuesday and then signed him to an eight-year, $168 million contract. Freeman will be making $27 million per season with the Dodgers. The immediate talk after the Freeman deal was how stacked LA's lineup is now: Freeman, Max Muncy (when healthy), Trea Turner and Justin Turner in the infield; A.J. Pollock, Cody Bellinger and Mookie Betts in the outfield; Will Smith catching; and Chris Taylor as a superutility player. The Dodgers can rotate a few of these players in the DH spot.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 9:05 p.m.:\u00a0Kris Bryant is the next big-name hitter to find a team. He and the Rockies have agreed on a seven-year, $182 million contract, Jon Heyman of MLB Network reported. The pact also contains a no-trade clause. Baseball media and fans were scratching their heads over this deal because of the money and the fact\u00a0Colorado traded franchise-icon third baseman Nolan Arenado and $51 million to the Cardinals in February 2021. Now the Rockies are replacing Arenado after a year with Bryant, who might split time between third and the outfield, as he did previously with the Cubs and the Giants. Joc Pederson is back in the NL West, joining a team that used to be a bitter rival but is also his hometown team. The outfielder joins the Giants on a one-year contract worth a reported $6 million. Pederson, who hails from Palo Alto, began his career with the Dodgers. He can expect to play a platoon role with matchup-mad San Francisco. Rays outfielder Austin Meadows is a hot topic in trade talks, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reported. Meadows, 26, drove in 106 runs with a .772 OPS (117 OPS+) for Tampa Bay in 2021, but he's arbitration-eligible for the first time, which means he's due a large raise, and the Rays have depth in the outfield: Randy Arozarena, Kevin Kiermaier, Manuel Margot, Brett Phillips, Vidal Brujan and Josh Lowe are all on the 40-man roster.\u00a0\u00a0 The Reds' roster teardown may not include rotation leaders Luis Castillo and Tyler Mahle. \"I don't see us moving any of those two players,\" general manager Nick Krall told reporters, per Mark Sheldon of MLB.com. Krall has made three trades since the end of the lockout, moving Sonny Gray, Eugenio Suarez, Jesse Winker and Amir Garrett. The biggest name coming back is Mike Minor, acquired in the Garrett trade. 3:50 p.m.: Nearly 20 years after the Royals selected him with the sixth overall pick of the 2002 MLB Draft, Zack Greinke is rejoining his original organization. The 38-year-old right-hander has agreed to a deal with Kansas City, Ken Rosenthal reported. Joel Sherman reported Greinke will make at least $13 million with $2 million more available based on how many innings he pitches.\u00a0 Speaking of veteran right-handers, reliever David Robertson \u2014 who turns 37 next month \u2014 has a one-year deal with the Cubs, the team announced. He'll get $3.5 million with the possibility of up to $1.5 million more in incentives, per Mark Feinsand.\u00a0 3:10 p.m.: No word yet on where Freddie Freeman will play this season, but the longtime Atlanta first baseman said his farewell to Braves fans via an Instagram post that concluded: \"Although our time has come to an end, I look forward to seeing and playing in front of you all again. When that time comes, I hope you remember all the wonderful memories we made together. I love you Braves Country! Champions Forever!\" A post shared by Freddie Freeman (@freddiefreeman) 2:10 p.m.: The Royals and Reds have made a trade that seems like a table-setter for another move. Kansas City is sending veteran lefty starter Mike Minor and cash to Cincinnati for somewhat younger lefty reliever Amir Garrett. Ken Rosenthal provides some context, noting that the Royals cleared $8.5 million in payroll with the move and adding that they are among the teams in the mix to trade for A's starter Frankie Montas.\u00a0 12:05 p.m.: Eddie Rosario played in only 33 regular-season games for the Braves last year after coming over from Cleveland, but he made a huge impact in the postseason and is back for more. The Braves announced that the 2021 NLCS MVP has re-signed on a two-year deal worth $9 million per season that also includes a club option at the same rate for 2024.\u00a0 11:20 a.m.: Toronto might not be done making moves. Ken Rosenthal reports the Jays have talked to the Guardians about acquiring All-Star infielder Jose Ramirez, who they would play at second base. After giving up four young players to land Matt Chapman from Oakland, though, how hard are the Jays willing to push to win now?\u00a0 11:00 a.m.: The Tigers have made a pair of moves to shore up their pitching staff. Evan Petzold first reported the team had reached an agreement with lefty reliever Andrew Chafin, and Ken Rosenthal adds that it is a two-year deal worth about $13 million. Petzold reported earlier in the day that starter Wily Peralta had agreed to a minor-league deal with Detroit that will pay him at least $2.5 million if he makes the major league roster.\u00a0 10:25 a.m.: Seiya Suzuki's deal with the Cubs is actually for $85 million over five years, reports Ken Rosenthal, who adds that Suzuki also has a full no-trade clause. The Cubs also will have to pay a posting fee that is not included in that total.\u00a0 9:58 a.m.: The Blue Jays are sending SS Kevin Smith, RHP Gunnar Hoglund, LHP Zach Logue and LHP Kirby Snead to the A's in their deal for Matt Chapman, Shi Davidi reports.\u00a0 9:53 a.m.: Kyle Schwarber's deal with the Phillies is for four years with an average annual value just under $20 million per year, according to Jayson Stark.\u00a0 9:20 a.m.: The Phillies are \"making progress\" on a deal with free-agent slugger Kyle Schwarber, reports Ken Rosenthal. Schwarber's market undoubtedly expanded with the move to a universal DH in the new collective bargaining agreement, making it easier for an NL team to justify adding the defensively deficient 29-year-old. UPDATE: Jim Salisbury says the deal is done, pending \"all the usual stuff\" aka a physical.\u00a0 8:45 a.m.: The Blue Jays are finalizing a trade that would bring All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman from Oakland to Toronto, Jon Morosi confirms. Former major leaguer Carlos Baerga first reported on Instagram that a deal was in place. Morosi says the Jays are not expected to be giving up any players from their projected Opening Day roster to the A's, who are now in full sell-off mode as they jettison the top defensive third baseman in the game for prospects.\u00a0 8:35 a.m.:\u00a0After meeting with Cubs owner Tom Ricketts and the Chicago front office, Hiroshima star Seiya Suzuki is reportedly signing with the Cubs for 5 years $70 million, per David Kaplan. 11:03 p.m.:\u00a0Anthony Rizzo is reportedly returning to the Yankees, per ESPN's Jesse Rogers. The contract is reportedly 2 years for $32 million with an opt out after year one. Breaking news: Anthony Rizzo in agreement on a contract with the Yankees, pending a physical. 1:45 p.m.: There hasn't been much buzz around the top free agent available, Carlos Correa, and that may be because he is leaning toward staying in Houston. Ken Rosenthal reported the Astros plan to make a new offer to the superstar shortstop and \"players can't stop talking about\" his potential return at Astros camp. 1:05 p.m.: The Braves put an exclamation point on their changing of the guard at first base, announcing they have signed new acquisition Matt Olson to an eight-year contract worth $168 million that runs through the 2029 season, with a club option for 2030. The Atlanta native will make $15 million this season, $21 million in 2023, and $22 million each year from 2024-29. His 2030 option is worth $20 million. Freddie Freeman may be gone, but Olson obviously is in Atlanta to stay. The Atlanta #Braves today signed INF @mattolson21 to an eight-year contract: pic.twitter.com/0qpvvkLAXG 12:35 p.m.: Veteran reliever Chris Martin won a World Series ring with Atlanta last season, but he'll have a new home in 2022. Jon Morosi reports Martin has agreed to a one-year contract with the Cubs that will pay him at least $2.5 million with the opportunity to add $750,000 more in bonuses.\u00a0\u00a0 10:30 a.m.: Free agent Nick Castellanos wanted to sign with his hometown Marlins -- and former team president Derek Jeter wanted to sign him -- but Miami is not currently \"aggressively pursuing\" the outfielder, according to Barry Jackson. 9:20 a.m.: The Pirates announced they have signed first baseman/designated hitter Daniel Vogelbach and reliever Heath Hembree to one-year deals. Jon Heyman reports Vogelbach will make $1 million and the deal includes an option for 2023 at $1.5 million, with an additional $400,000 possible via incentives.\u00a0 8:35 a.m.: The Freddie Freeman market appears wide open with a return to the Braves now off the table thanks to their trade for Matt Olson. According to Jon Heyman, the Red Sox are now involved along with previously reported suitors: the Dodgers, Yankees, Rays and Blue Jays.\u00a0 4:46 p.m.:\u00a0The Mariners trade for Jesse Winker, who made his first All-Star Game last season.\u00a0 BREAKING: The Seattle Mariners are finalizing a trade to acquire All-Star outfielder Jesse Winker from the Cincinnati Reds, sources familiar with the deal tell ESPN. Winker hit .305/.394/.556 last season with a career-high 24 home runs.\u00a0 The Mariners also acquired Eugenio Suarez from Reds, purging $35M. The Reds' big tank continues. Reds offseason:\n\nLose Wade Miley on waivers, save $10M\n\nTrade Sonny Gray to Twins for two prospects, save $10M\n\nTrade Jesse Winker and Eugenio Su\u00e1rez to Mariners for four young players, save about $40M https://t.co/DJrfZ3zD51 4:35 p.m.:\u00a0Coveted Japanese free-agent outfielder Seiya Suzuki says he has not yet picked an MLB team, contrary to reports that he was set to join the Padres. While San Diego remains perhaps the favorite to land the 27-year-old, Jon Heyman reports the Dodgers, Giants, Red Sox, Mariners, Cubs and others are still involved. Elsewhere in the NL West, the Rockies are making a push for free agent Kris Bryant, according to Nick Groke and Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.\u00a0\u00a0 2:12 p.m.: The Braves have their first baseman for 2022, but it isn't Freddie Freeman. The reigning World Series champions are set to acquire Matt Olson from Oakland, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. That would seem to leave the Dodgers as the favorite to sign Freeman, with the Yankees still a possibility as well. Olson, an Atlanta native who turns 28 next month, will have the tough task of replacing Freeman. He hit 39 home runs and posted a .911 OPS last season as he made the All-Star Game for the first time in his fourth full MLB season.\u00a0 The A's will get outfielder Cristian Pache, catcher Shea Langeliers, and pitchers Ryan Cusick and Joey Este in return for Olson, Passan reported.\u00a0 1:15 p.m.: The Twins continue to be among the most active teams post-lockout, and they apparently are looking to make another rotation addition a day after acquiring Sonny Gray from Cincinnati. Jon Morosi reports the Twins and Athletics are engaged in discussions about a starting pitcher \u2014 likely\u00a0Sean Manaea or Frankie Montas\u00a0\u2014 moving to Minnesota.\u00a0 10:20 a.m.: Will Monday be the day Freddie Freeman makes a decision? Jon Heyman reports the Yankees are \"pessimistic\" about their chances to land the free-agent slugger, which would seem to leave a return to the Braves or a return home to the Dodgers as his top choices. As for the Yankees, it appears Anthony Rizzo might make the most sense among the remaining first basemen with the A's apparently asking a bit much for Matt Olson.\u00a0 8:45 a.m.: Reporters are back in MLB clubhouses starting today, and that access already has paid dividends. Veteran reliever Sean Doolittle has a locker in the Nationals' clubhouse in West Palm Beach, Jesse Dougherty of the Washington Post noted. The lefty has agreed to a major-league deal with the Nats pending a physical.\u00a0 4:05 a.m.: Where to begin? With a late-night blockbuster between the Yankees and Twins. New York acquired third baseman Josh Donaldson, infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa and catcher Ben Rortvedt from Minnesota for catcher Gary Sanchez and third baseman Gio Urshela. The Yankees reportedly will take on all of Donaldson's contract (two years, $50 million). Kiner-Falefa was a Twin for one day after being acquired in a trade with the Rangers. He's now the Yankees' new shortstop. What will Minnesota do for a shortstop now? A source told\u00a0Dan Hayes of The Athletic\u00a0that the team has been in contact with free agent Trevor Story. Nelson Cruz is moving to the National League to be the Nationals' DH in 2022. Multiple reports said that the sides agreed on a one-year contract with a mutual option for 2023. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reported that the total guarantee is $15 million --- a $12 million salary in 2022 and a $3 million buyout of a $16 million option for '23. There's an opening for a Carlos Correa-Astros reunion. Per Mark Berman of Houston television station KRIV, team owner Jim Crane said the team has \"reached out\" to Correa's representatives and \"are in discussions.\"\u00a0 Right-hander Ian Kennedy is returning to the Diamondbacks. He has agreed to a one-year contract worth $4.75 million and can make an additional $2.35 million in incentives, MLB Network's Jon Heyman reported. Kennedy pitched for Arizona from 2010-13; he went 21-4 with a 2.88 ERA in 2011. He split the 2021 season between Texas and Philadelphia, closing for both teams.\u00a0 Carlos Martinez is on his way to San Francisco. The right-hander announced the move on Instagram. Martinez, 30, spent the first nine years of his MLB career with the Cardinals, but the past two were marked by injuries and ineffectiveness.\u00a0 The Padres are \"aggressively shopping\" first baseman Eric Hosmer and outfielder Wil Myers, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reported. Both players have bloated contracts; Hosmer has four years and $59 million remaining on his deal, while Myers has one year and $20 million (plus a club option for 2023) left on his, according to Cot's Contracts. Moving Myers would help clear the way for Japanese free agent Seiya Suzuki. The outfielder worked out for Padres executives at Petco Park during the weekend and met with Padres ace Yu Darvish and his family, Dennis Lin of The Athletic reported.\u00a0 2:29 p.m.:\u00a0The NL East is making some moves. The Phillies are reportedly looking at bringing back outfielder Odubel Herrera, according to Audacy's Jon Heyman. Heyman also reported that the Nationals have brought back Anibal Sanchez, while the New York Post's Joel Sherman reported that the Mets have signed reliever Adam Ottavino. 1:41 p.m.:\u00a0FanSided's Robert Murary reported\u00a0that longtime Phillie \u2014 and, more recently, Padre \u2014 starting pitcher Vince Velasquez has signed with the White Sox. 1:30 p.m.:\u00a0The Reds announced that they had traded starting pitcher Sonny Gray to the Twins along with Francis Peguero in exchange for top prospect Chase Petty. After a down year in 2018 with the Yankees, Gray, 32, had a resurgence with the Reds, pitching to a 3.49 ERA across 68 starts in three seasons with 432 strikeouts. Petty, 18, was drafted 26th overall in 2021, and ranked as the No. 7 prospect in the Twins' system, according to MLB Pipeline. Peguero, 24, had a 4.96 ERA in 28 relief appearances in Class High-A Daytona in 2021. 1:10 p.m.:\u00a0Several utility bats are on the move in the free agency market.

The Red Sox inked left-handers Matt Strahm and Jake Diekman to deals, according to FanSided's Robert Murray and\u00a0MassLive's Chris Cotillo.

The Phillies are one of the teams with interest in acquiring him. But Philadelphia is balking at the price tag, reports Alex Coffey of the Philadelphia Inquirer, a former A's beat writer. Per source, A\u2019s won\u2019t agree to trade Matt Chapman to the Phillies unless returning package includes someone at the top of the Phillies farm system (Painter, Abel, Stott, etc). Source says that thus far, Phillies have been reluctant to deal those guys. 8:49 p.m.: Veteran reliever Alex Colome is headed to the Rockies, reports ESPN's Enrique Rojas. Source: Dominican reliever Alex Colom\u00e9 has a one-year agreement with the #Rockies, pending physical\n\nFuente: Relevista dominicano Alex Colom\u00e9 tienen acuerdo por un a\u00f1o con #Rockies, pendiente a prueba f\u00edsica.

Deal can be worth as much $7 million. 8:39 p.m.: The Mets upgraded their rotation with right-hander Chris Bassitt, acquired from the A's for pitching prospects J.T. Ginn and Adam Oller. Bassitt, 33, was one of Oakland's top starters last season (3.15 ERA/3.34 FIP, 9.1 K/9), and he showed his grit by returning from a brutal mid-August facial injury to pitch twice in September. New York's starting five is now Jacob deGrom, Max Scherzer, Bassitt, Taijuan Walker and Carlos Carrasco.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 8:33 p.m.: The Rangers traded Gold Glove infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa and minor league pitcher Ronny Henriquez to the Twins for slugging catcher Mitch Garver. Kiner-Falefa will likely slot in at shortstop for Minnesota, which can now keep Jorge Polanco at second base. Garver will start the season as Texas' No. 1 receiver ahead of Jose Trevino and Jonah Heim. 8:20 p.m.: The Astros add to their infield depth with former Tigers utilityman Niko Goodrum. Houston signed him to a one-year contract. Goodrum, 30, rejected an outright assignment to the minors by Detroit in November and became a free agent. He has played everywhere but pitcher and catcher in his MLB career. Niko Goodrum on agreeing to a one-year deal with the Astros, pending physical: \u201cOne of the big things is winning,\u201d he said on what drew him to Houston. \u201cI've been playing against them for four years and just see the amazing things going on.\u201d 8:17 p.m.: Veteran catcher Luke Maile lands with the Guardians on a one-year, $900,000 contract.

We have signed RHP Jordan Lyles to a one-year contract for the 2022 season with a club option for 2023.\n\nWelcome to Birdland, Jordan! pic.twitter.com/R2mmkx2GvY 8 p.m.: The White Sox are bringing in veteran utilityman Josh Harrison on a one-year, $5 million contract that includes a club option for 2023. Harrison, 34, played for the Nationals and A's last season. One year, $5.5M, including $1.5M buyout on club option for 2023. https://t.co/C2mc3jF0F1 7:50 p.m.: The White Sox's bullpen is even deeper after the addition of\u00a0right-hander Joe Kelly, who reportedly has agreed to a two-year contract with a club option for 2024. The deal reportedly guarantees Kelly $17 million. High-powered reliever Joe Kelly has agreed to a 2-year contract with the Chicago #WhiteSox. The deal will be final when he completes a physical. Joe Kelly\u2019s deal with the #WhiteSox is 2 years with an option for $17M Kelly gives Chicago another flamethrowing late-inning option. He joins Liam Hendriks, Craig Kimbrel, Kendall Graveman, Aaron Bummer, Garrett Crochet and, unless he joins the rotation, Michael Kopech.\u00a0 7:47 p.m.: Another shortstop is off the board: Jose Iglesias goes to the Rockies on a one-year deal worth a reported $5 million. The defense-first Iglesias, 32, will take Trevor Story's spot on the infield. Iglesias played for the Angels and Red Sox in 2021.

Last season, he pitched to a 4.41 ERA/4.61 FIP in 157 innings. Seattle skipped his final turn in the rotation in late September because of ineffectiveness. 8:45 p.m.: Freddie Freeman Watch is on. The slugging first baseman could make a decision by Saturday after receiving a \"strong\" offer from the Dodgers, Jon Morosi reports. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Chicago has agreed to a one-year, $4 million contract (plus incentives) with Andrelton Simmons, MLB Network's Jon Heyman reported. The smooth-fielding Simmons, 32, played in 131 games for the Twins last season. Andrelton Simmons to Cubs. $4M plus incentives. There were rumors earlier that top-of-the-line free agent Carlos Correa was in play for the Cubs; interestingly, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reports that Chicago could still try to sign him.. A one-year agreement with Andrelton Simmons - $4M, plus incentives, per @JonHeyman - would not preclude the Cubs from pursuing Carlos Correa, if they choose to move in that direction. 6:12 p.m.: Clayton Kershaw is back for another season with Dodgers, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reported. Sources later told ESPN's Jeff Passan that the one-year contract is worth $17 million, with another $5 million in incentives.

Kershaw missed the postseason in 2021 with an elbow issue. He told @ByMcCullough today that he is healthy, but slightly behind where he normally is at this time of year. https://t.co/y7cKPrYsv7 4:06 p.m.:\u00a0Carlos Rodon gets paid: The Giants and the starter agree to a two-year, $44 million pact, according to Jeff Passan. Passan reports that the deal also includes an opt-out after the first year. Left-handed starter Carlos Rod\u00f3n and the San Francisco Giants are in agreement on a two-year, $44 million contract that includes an opt-out after the first season, sources familiar with the deal tell ESPN. 4:05 p.m.:\u00a0If you think it'd be weird to see Clayton Kershaw in a uniform other than a Dodgers' uniform, then you're not alone. According to ESPN's Buster Olney, \"industry speculation\" dictates that Kershaw will go back to Chavez Ravine for another season. There is heavy industry expectation that Clayton Kershaw will return to the Dodgers for the 2022 season. 3:58 p.m.:\u00a0The Red Sox could bring back starter Colin McHugh. McHugh signed to pitch for Boston in 2020, but opted out due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Collin McHugh has a robust market, as expected, and the Red Sox are among the teams interested, according to an industry source. He will have options.\n\nMcHugh signed with BOS in 2020 then opted out of the season, largely due to injury concerns. He was great in \u201821 for TB. 3:45 p.m.:\u00a0Freddie Freeman: Los Angeles Dodger? Dave Roberts says that the possibility exists, and that signing Freeman is \"certainly in the conversation\" for LA.

According to Mark Feinsand, there are several teams interested in the slugger, and with the addition of the DH in the NL, he may have a market if he chooses to continue playing. Three teams rumored to be involved: The Mariners, Cardinals and Rockies. Per sources, three teams have expressed interest in Albert Pujols. The addition of the DH to the National League has seemingly widened the market for the future Hall of Famer. 2:35 p.m.:\u00a0Oh, we're cooking now: Martin P\u00e9rez is on his way to Texas, per the Athletic's Robert Murray. He gets $4 million on a one-year deal.

NL MVP Bryce Harper is stumping for good friend/Vegas neighbor Kris Bryant in Philly. Harper pull helped keep Realmuto. Phils have needs but also options (Schwarber, Conforto, Castellanos, etc.) KB does fit, either for 3B and/or OF. He, too, has options: Sea, Colo, SD, NYM, more 8:50 a.m.: The Cubs are eyeing one of free agency's top stars to rekindle the hot stove: Jon Morosi reports that Chicago is among the favorites to land Carlos Correa.\u00a0 Source: The #Cubs, who engaged with Carlos Correa in negotiations before the lockout began, are among the favorites to sign him as the market reopens. \u2066@MLBNetwork\u2069 @MLB https://t.co/rmnpEZcJYC 8:30 a.m.: The Braves took a serious run at Justin Verlander before he ended up re-signing with the Astros, per Jon Morosi \u2014 an indication the defending champs will look to bolster their rotation now that business is back on.\u00a0 Source: Prior to lockout, #Braves had detailed conversations with free agent Justin Verlander. He ultimately returned to Houston, but this indicates that the Braves are trying to fit a high-level starter *and* Freddie Freeman into their budget. @MLBNetwork @MLB 11:36 p.m.:\u00a0Still no new free-agent signings as it inches toward midnight on the east coast. It seems like we won't see any new deals until Friday, at this rate. 10:05 p.m.:\u00a0Speaking of Freeman, the Dodgers have a \"sincere\" interest in him. So do the Braves and Yankees. #Dodgers interest in Freddie Freeman is sincere, based on what I have heard from sources tonight. #Braves and #Yankees obviously are prominent in the Freeman marketplace. Some in the industry believe he could be next major free agent to sign. @MLBNetwork 10:03 p.m.: It would appear that Freddie Freeman isn't the only former Brave that will be a hot commodity on the free-agent market. Jorge Soler is expected to draw a lot of interest with MLB's institution of the universal DH. The addition of the Universal DH should help free agents such as Jorge Soler. More than a half-dozen teams had already shown interest in the World Series MVP, though that number figures to rise now that the DH is coming to the NL. 9:10 p.m.:\u00a0MLB Network's Jon Morosi reports that free agency talks are \"extremely\" busy. There haven't been any signings into this second wave of free agency, but Morosi says it will be a \"busy weekend.\" Free agency talks are \u201cextremely\u201d busy, in the words of one agent. We\u2019re only 2 hours into the market. Busy weekend ahead. @MLBNetwork 8:40 p.m.:\u00a0So much for \"pandemonium,\" at least out of the gate. There still haven't been any new free-agent deals or trades since MLB free agency reopened at 7 p.m. ET. Perhaps MLB GMs are gearing up for a late-night rush. 7:44 p.m.: No free-agent deals to report on yet, but\u00a0Bob Nightengale\u00a0reports that 16 teams will play their Opening Day on April 7 while 14 will have theirs on April 8. The first game on the schedule in 2022 will be a Red Sox-Yankees clash at Yankee Stadium. 7:29 p.m.:\u00a0Something to keep in mind for Blue Jays fans \u2014 unvaccinated players are not able to play in Canada under the new CBA. As such, Toronto almost certainly won't sign unvaccinated players. Veteran @mlb player tells me and an MLB Official confirms. \u2026 unvaccinated players can\u2019t play in Canada and under new CBA they will not be paid or receive service time for those games missed in Canada #wcvb 6:59 p.m.:\u00a0Are the Yankees going to get Freddie Freeman? ESPN's Buster Olney reports that rival executives are wondering if New York will move quickly on the former Braves slugger. As the transactions begin, some rival executives curious about whether the Yankees attempt to move quickly on Freddie Freeman. 6:50 p.m.:\u00a0The owners have officially voted to end the lockout meaning that the start of free agency is imminent. It will begin at about 7 p.m. ET when the lockout is set to officially be lifted. On a technical level: the lockout will be lifted at around 7 p.m. ET, MLB says. 4 p.m.:\u00a0For those who have been patiently waiting the restart of MLB, this should excite you just a bit:\u00a0 Asked one agent on what he expects free agency to be like. \u201cPandemonium,\u201d he said. MORE:\u00a0Carlos Correa, Freddie Freeman lead list of MLB's 35 best post-lockout free agents SN is tracking where the top 25 free agents,  according to our list, will be signing. Deals signed by other free agents will be included in the section below: Here are the top 10 MLB free agents available after the lockout, according to SN's Ryan Fagan. You can see his entire list of the top 35 players here. Opening Day age:\u00a027\nNovember FA rank:\u00a01 Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0Correa is one hell of a baseball player. The primary knock on him has been his struggle to stay healthy and on the field, but he played 148 games for Houston last year, popping 26 homers to go with 92 RBI, a 7.2 bWAR \u2014 that number led AL position players \u2014 and 131 OPS+. He\u2019s an elite defensive shortstop \u2014 he won the Platinum Glove award as the AL\u2019s best defensive player \u2014 and he\u2019s been outstanding in the postseason, with an .849 OPS and 18 homers in 79 career playoff games. And, yeah, there\u2019s the whole sign-stealing scandal that might rub fans the wrong way, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that being an impediment for a team that sees Correa as a fit. A lot of people thought he\u2019d be a great fit in Detroit, on an up-and-coming team with his former manager, A.J. Hinch, but the Tigers signed Javier Baez. The Rangers took two of the free-agent shortstops off the market (Corey Seager and Marcus Semien). So where does Correa land? The Yankees are still a possibility, if they open up the vault. Maybe he goes back to Houston? Philly? The Dodgers?\u00a0 Opening Day age:\u00a032\nNovember FA rank:\u00a04 Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0Here\u2019s what we\u00a0wrote in November: \u201cThere\u2019s just no way Atlanta can let him leave. None. Zero. But he\u2019s a free agent, and he\u2019s one hell of a player, so he\u2019s on this list. Can you imagine how Braves fans would react if Atlanta offered Freeman a below-market deal and he left? It would be the shorted post-World Series honeymoon in the history of baseball.\u201d Yeah \u2026 about that, well, the Braves didn\u2019t offer him the right deal, apparently, and the chances of Freeman leaving seem a lot more real than they did a few months ago. Promise we\u2019re not going to mention the Yankees for every player, but the idea of his lefty bat in the middle of that lineup with right-handed sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, taking aim at that short porch in right field at Yankee Stadium? That makes a lot of sense. \u00a0 Opening Day age:\u00a030\nNovember FA rank:\u00a07 Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0After a largely forgettable 2020 season, Bryant reestablished himself as an All-Star caliber player in 2021, with the Cubs and the Giants. He won\u2019t get the bank-breaking blank-check mega-deal he once seemed destined for, but what team that fancies itself a World Series contender wouldn\u2019t want to add a middle-of-the-order bat who is capable of starting at five positions on the field? If we\u2019re betting, we\u2019d bet that he returns to San Francisco, especially after Buster Posey retired and the Giants lost his right-handed bat in the lineup. Opening Day age:\u00a030\nNovember FA rank:\u00a08 Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0Castellanos, a shaky but passable defender, was helped by the news of a universal DH as much as any free-agent (other than maybe Nelson Cruz). Castellanos can hit, and he can hit anywhere. He\u2019s the type of bat that helps a \u201cmeh\u201d offense become a good offense, or a good offense become a great offense. Don\u2019t overthink it. If your favorite team needs an outfielder (or a DH) and the offense needs a boost, Castellanos is the best option.\u00a0 Opening Day age:\u00a029\nNovember FA rank:\u00a012 Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0Story struggled at the plate in 2021, no other way to put it. In the previous three years, he averaged a .292/.355/.554 slash line with a .909 OPS and 123 OPS+. In 2021, he posted a .251/.329/.471 slash line, with a .801 OPS and 103 OPS+. Like most hitters with the Rockies, Story\u2019s numbers away from Coors Field have always been worse than his numbers at home, but his .203 average and .292 on-base percentage in 2021 were eye-opening. He did, though, hit more homers on the road (13) than at home (11). He\u2019ll be able to find a multiple-year deal if he wants it, but if he wants to bet on himself and maximize his earning power, signing a one-year deal outside Colorado and producing like an All-Star/MVP candidate, then going back into the free-agent pool heading into his Age 30 season isn\u2019t a bad option. \u00a0 Opening Day age:\u00a029\nNovember FA rank:\u00a014 Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0Remember what we said about Castellanos? Same thing with Schwarber. The bat plays, at an elite level, and with the DH arriving in NL parks for 2022 and beyond, the lefty slugger should have no shortage of suitors once the machine starts back up. It\u2019s funny, because as an outfielder who should be primarily a DH, that\u2019s a drawback. But as a primary DH who can also play competent outfield for short stretches, it\u2019s like a big bonus.\u00a0 Opening Day age:\u00a027\nNovember FA rank:\u00a0N/A (wasn\u2019t officially a free-agent when our original list published) Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0Suzuki made his debut with the Hiroshima Carp at 18 years old, and by 21 he was a legitimate star in Japan. In his \u201cworst\u201d season \u2014 2020, at Age 25 \u2014 he batted .300 with a .953 OPS, 25 homers and 75 RBIs in 118 games. He followed that with a spectacular 2021 campaign, blasting 38 homers in 134 games, to go with a .317 average and 1.069 OPS.\u00a0Over at FanGraphs, Suzuki\u2019s ZIPS projections put him in the 21-23 homer range for the next several seasons, which would represent a nice right-handed outfield power upgrade for lots of contending teams. So where will he wind up? He\u2019s been connected to the Cubs, Giants, Red Sox, Mariners and Padres, among other teams. Basically, pretty much everyone\u2019s interested, as they should be. Opening Day age:\u00a029\nNovember FA rank:\u00a016 Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0Just a stellar bounce-back year. Shoulder concerns might limit teams\u2019 willingness to offer multiple years, but a gamble on a short (one or two year) deal at a higher salary seems like it would be appealing to lots of teams. Not Scherzer/Verlander money, but significant. And it wouldn\u2019t be bad for Rodon to get back on the FA market with a healthy year or two under his belt at 30 or 31.\u00a0 Opening Day age:\u00a034\nNovember FA rank:\u00a018 Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0Another guy it's hard to imagine anywhere other than the team he\u2019s always played with. Kershaw\u2019s been outstanding when healthy \u2014 his 3.00 FIP was his best since 2016 \u2014 but he hasn\u2019t made more than 28 starts since 2015 (he made 22 in 2021). How do you figure out a contract for him? I still think he winds up back in L.A., but there\u2019s noise about the Rangers. They signed Seager and Semien, but even with Jon Gray added to the rotation, they could use another starter. Also, convincing Kershaw to return home would give the rebuilding club more credibility \u2014 a huge boost at the gate on days he pitches.\u00a0 Opening Day age:\u00a030\nNovember FA rank:\u00a021 Why he\u2019s here:\u00a0Did any player bump his value more than Soler in the postseason? It\u2019ll be interesting to see how teams evaluate him; do they give more weight to his struggles in Kansas City in 2020-21 or his dynamic play with Atlanta? Obviously, he\u2019s pleased with the universal DH development, too.\u00a0 SN's Edward Sutelan and Jacob Camenker contributed to this piece.   "

        "text": "Only one member of the United States men\u2019s national team has been in this situation before, but every member of its fan base has, and that is where the problem develops as the USMNT gets set to play its final three World Cup qualifiers of the 2022 cycle. The memory of October 2017 will linger for years regardless of what happens in the next week, but the current players are empowered to assure it can no longer be weaponized against them. \u201cPersonally, for me, I think about sitting on my couch watching the 2017 cycle and remembering when we didn\u2019t qualify for the World Cup, and, personally, the effect that had on me,\u201d current midfielder and frequent USMNT captain Tyler Adams told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI think about the responsibility I have, and the responsibility I have on some of my teammates that \u2014 we have to qualify. There\u2019s just no other option. MORE: When is Mexico vs. USMNT? Full preview with World Cup qualification scenarios \u201cI think that when you are in big games and important games, you always have to remember what motivates you and what you\u2019re doing it for. And for us, we\u2019re doing it for all the U.S. fans, and we don\u2019t want to, obviously, let down our nation.\u201d There are three games remaining in CONCACAF World Cup qualifying, starting Thursday night at the Azteca Stadium against rival Mexico. Any combination of six points gained by the second-place U.S. and lost by fourth-place Panama all but assures the Americans are heading to Qatar in November. Only an unlikely near-perfect window from Costa Rica could cause any other havoc. It seems like such a meager requirement. It could, in fact, be covered in one night were the USMNT to defeat Panama on Sunday evening in Orlando. Or perhaps the Americans will travel to Costa Rica on March 30, the final qualifying date, with work still to be done. This process is hardly ever as elementary as American fans wish it to be, and never was that more clear than when the U.S. traveled to last-place Trinidad & Tobago nearly five years ago needing only a draw to reach the 2018 World Cup, and failed. Even a loss would have have likely seen the U.S. backdoor its way into the competition, but a combination of disastrous results elsewhere created the perfect storm, and the United States was shockingly left out. MORE: Full USMNT roster breakdown for March World Cup qualifiers The redemption story has been further complicated by the absence of four key regulars who drove a significant amount of the a success in this qualifying cycle. Midfielder Weston McKennie and right back Sergino Dest, both regular starters, are out with injuries. Forward Brenden Aaronson, who has been one of the most consistent contributors, and goalkeeper Matt Turner, who has started several games and grabbed hold of the starting role, also are out. The chemistry is on another level. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c pic.twitter.com/seyvdbKI9X The one positive development in terms of availability is the return of versatile teenager Gio Reyna, the team\u2019s most talented young player, who has not played qualifying since September because of a hamstring injury. He did not appear with his club, Borussia Dortmund of Germany\u2019s Bundesliga, until early February, and then was injured again two weeks later when making his first start in five months.\n\nHe was able to play 90 minutes, however, in a game this past Sunday, and it was fortuitous for the U.S. that he was deployed as a midfielder. With McKennie leaving a substantial hole in that area \u2014 he provides a level of energy unmatched within the program\u2014 Reyna could take on a substantial role there.\u00a0\n\nWith four goals in nine caps \u2014 he often has been deployed on the outside of a three-man front line, including in the Nations League final victory over Mexico last June. But he will eagerly take on the role of attacking midfielder if that\u2019s what coach Gregg Berhalter believes is best.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI feel perfectly comfortable playing there. I think that No. 10 is probably my best position, where I grew up playing. I\u2019ve played there for Dortmund recently,\u201d Reyna said. \u201cObviously, Weston does a lot for the team. I can try to fill the shoes if I need to, if I\u2019m asked, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other guys capable of doing it, too. I know he\u2019ll be supporting us. We\u2019re going to try to get it done for him.\u201d\n\nReyna is uncertain how he\u2019ll be used over the course of the three games. Given the importance of the Panama game, it may be wise for Berhalter to withhold him for most or all of the 90 against Mexico, depending on how that one develops. Reyna acknowledges, though, he is not in position to go 90 in each of three games over seven days. His playing time will be managed. Even with so much time away, Reyna told The Sporting News, his comfort at being on the field did not dissipate. It\u2019s simply a matter of continuing to improve his level of fitness. He said his strength is returning and he is confident in his body, but he has talked with Berhalter about how to manage his minutes and suggested it\u2019s yet to be determined which games he might enter as reserve and whether and where he might start. MORE: Latest USMNT injury news \u201cAll the stuff on the field, I\u2019ve been doing my whole life,\u201d Reyna said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s going to take some time to get used to it, but that\u2019s why I had a few weeks before Of training before joining the team in games. But I think the fitness was probably the main thing. It\u2019s still probably\u2014 I need a few more weeks before I\u2019m 100 percent running 90 minutes consistently.\u201d When the Americans were flopping in Trinidad, Adams had just begun his second season in Major League Soccer with the New York Red Bulls and recently completed a superb performance at the U-20 World Cup. He was called into a senior national team training camp not long after the failure in Trinidad, which makes him wonder if he might have been a part of the 2018 World Cup team \u2014 had there even been one. \u201cThe effect that had on me was not being able to watch our country in a World Cup again and continue to see the development of our country in the world of soccer. Who knows, maybe if we qualify, I\u2019m going to be part of that group and a part of the World Cup cycle?\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt has a big effect on young players. It gives them an opportunity to play the international game on the biggest stage, at the biggest level. So that\u2019s what I think of when we go through these qualifying games.\u201d The ghosts of 2017 still linger, and while Adams may say the U.S. has \"no other choice\" but to qualify, fans know there's another, far more painful outcome still on the table. It's up to the players to prove they belong \u2014 and deserve \u2014 the far more favorable result."

        "text": "The season\u2019s a few weeks away and most of the key free agents have found new homes, so it\u2019s time to start taking a look at the key questions in each division.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with the NL East.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start here: They\u2019ll win more regular-season games than they did in 2021.\u00a0 Remember, the Braves didn\u2019t climb over the .500 mark last year until August. Yeah, August. They had an oddly incredible July stretch when they alternated wins and losses for 18 consecutive games. The Braves that cruised through August (18-8), September (16-10) and steamrolled everyone in the postseason didn\u2019t exist from April to July. FOSTER: Freddie Freeman, Braves each made right decision in star\u2019s free-agency drama\u00a0 That likely won\u2019t be the case this year. Sure, they lost Freddie Freeman but they replaced him with a younger first baseman who hit more home runs and had a better WAR last year. That\u2019s not to say Matt Olson is a better player \u2014 Freeman\u2019s consistency cannot be understated \u2014 but at the very least, it\u2019s not a giant drop-off. The lineup this year features four sluggers who had at least 30 home runs and 100 RBIs last year \u2014 Olson, Ozzie Albies, Austin Riley and Adam Duvall \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t include Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., who hit 24 homers in 82 games.\u00a0 The Phillies scored at least six runs in a game 48 times last year \u2014 that was tied with Cleveland and Detroit for 19th-most in MLB \u2014 and they went 40-8 in those contests. On the flip side, the Phillies allowed at least six runs in a game 54 times last year \u2014 tied with Cleveland for 12th-most in MLB \u2014 and they had a .241 winning percentage (13-41) in those games. That\u2019s actually the best winning percentage of any team with 54 or more such games.\u00a0 So the Phillies know they\u2019re at least capable of winning slugfests from time to time.\u00a0 They\u2019ve spent their post-lockout days leaning into that, signing two of the best bat-first players on the market, first Kyle Schwarber and then Nick Castellanos. Most days, one will play left field and the other will DH. They\u2019re both mostly competent in the field, but neither will be a contender for a Gold Glove during his years in Philly.\u00a0 But adding to their offense is good, because the Phillies will almost certainly need it. When they scored three or fewer runs last year, the club had just a .219 winning percentage. Basically, they were more likely to win a game 7-6 than to win a game 3-2. They still have Zach Wheeler and Aaron Nola atop the rotation, and if they stay healthy they\u2019ll have a full year from Ranger Suarez (who was in the bullpen most of 2021) and Kyle Gibson (a trade pickup). Plus they added Corey Knebel, Jeurys Familia and Brad Hand to the bullpen, which should help. But Phillies fans have heard about free-agent signings \u201cwhich should help\u201d the bullpen in recent years and that wasn\u2019t the case. So, yeah, the fans will probably remain skeptical.\u00a0 In Year One with the Mets, Lindor was fine. That\u2019s about it. Fine. OK. An above-average MLB shortstop \u2014 3.1 bWAR, 2.7 fWAR \u2014 but well below his average season and way, way below expectations created by the 10-year, $341 million contract he signed before ever playing a game in a Mets uniform. The 2021 season was his fifth full season in the majors \u2014 not counting 2015, when he wasn\u2019t called up until mid-June, or the pandemic-shortened 2020 season \u2014 and he posted career lows in games played (125), on-base percentage (.322), OPS+ (101), average (.230), doubles (16) and stolen bases (10), to name a few. Expectations are the Year Two with the Mets will be better, and that the Mets will get into the postseason after missing in 2021. And there\u2019s no reason to think that won\u2019t be the case. Lindor is heading into his Age 28 season \u2014 his prime \u2014 and the Mets added all around the diamond this offseason. Max Scherzer and Chris Bassitt join Jacob deGrom in the rotation, Starling Marte becomes the much-needed impact center fielder and Eduardo Escobar arrives to solidify third base, though he can play other positions if the need arises. But for the Mets to be Peak Mets \u2014 no, not that way \u2014 they need their shortstop to be Peak Lindor. \u00a0 \u00a0 I\u2019ll say this right off the bat: The Marlins are better than you probably think they are. They will not be an afterthought in the NL East like they were in 2021.\u00a0 Look at the top of their rotation, which starts with the criminally underrated Sandy Alcantarra, who had a 3.19 ERA in 33 starts. Then there\u2019s lefty Trevor Rogers, who had a 2.64 ERA in 25 starts as a rookie and Pablo Lopez, who had a 3.07 ERA in 20 starts. That\u2019s legit good. If Jesus Luzardo finds the stuff that made him a top prospect in Oakland \u2014 he\u2019s just 24 years old \u2014 the Marlins can throw out a rotation that rivals any in the division.\u00a0 The Marlins scored the fewest runs in the NL East last year, but they added Avisail Garcia (29 homers) and Jorge Soler (World Series MVP) to the outfield/DH mix and traded for veterans Jacob Stallings and Joey Wendle. And rising star Jazz Chisholm \u2014 who had 18 homers and 23 stolen bases last year \u2014 is just scratching the surface of what he\u2019s capable of.\u00a0 In my mind, they enter 2022 as legitimate wild-card contenders.\u00a0 The Nationals are in a weird spot. They traded pretty much everyone they could before the end-of-July deadline last year. Contending seems unlikely. Juan Soto\u2019s still there, though, and he just might be the best hitter in baseball, despite that he\u2019s just 23 years old. He led the majors with a .465 on-base percentage; only two other players \u2014 Bryce Harper (.429) and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (.401) \u2014 topped the .400 mark in baseball. But he was kind of alone in the lineup, so the Nationals smartly signed Nelson Cruz to hit behind Soto, but also to be a veteran leader in the clubhouse. Most of the \u201cveterans\u201d were traded away last July, or left when Ryan Zimmerman retired. Even with Cruz there, Soto won\u2019t get a ton of pitches to hit, which means he can\u2019t miss the good ones when he sees them. That sounds challenging until you remember that\u2019s basically what he did after the trade deadline, and all he did in August through the end of the year was bat .335 with a .528 on-base percentage and 1.107 OPS.\u00a0 So, yeah, we\u2019re all very excited for his Age 23 season. \u00a0"

        "description": "Could Odell Beckham Jr. return to the Browns? It's a longshot, but with Baker Mayfield set to leave the team, Beckham isn't ruling out a return.",
        "text": "Odell Beckham Jr. hasn't yet decided where he will play in 2022, but the 29-year-old seems open to just about anything. That includes returning to Cleveland to play with the Browns. Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com reports that Beckham hasn't ruled out a reunion with the Browns. Why would the veteran receiver want to return to a franchise with which he had a falling out in 2021? Apparently, it's all about the team's decision to replace Baker Mayfield. Beckham is open to the possibility because he loved his teammates and Browns fans, and only left when things reached the point of no return with Baker Mayfield. But now that Mayfield is on his way out and three-time Pro Bowler Deshaun Watson is here, Beckham, 29, wouldn\u2019t rule out coming back if the Browns were interested. Cabot would go on to describe Beckham's return as \"a longshot\" given the way that he exited the team. However, she noted that owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam \"like [him] a lot\" and so do his former teammates, including star defensive end Myles Garrett. As such, Beckham returning to Cleveland at least remains a possibility \u2014 and an interesting one at that, as he noted in a Twitter conversation with a Browns fan. Lol that\u2019s an interesting one IYER: Grading NFL free agency move from best (Bucs) to worst (Texans) Of course, the Browns are far from Beckham's only option in free agency. He is the best remaining free-agent receiver on the market, and if not for the torn ACL he suffered during Super Bowl 56, he likely would have signed by now. Several teams have an interest in him, and that includes the Rams. The Rams added Beckham to their roster after he was released by the Browns. He posted 48 catches for 593 yards and seven touchdowns in 12 games with the team, including the postseason. He played a big part in the team's run to the Super Bowl, as he helped replace Robert Woods after his torn ACL and gave Matthew Stafford a reliable No. 2 receiver. Thus, it's no surprise that Los Angeles would like to keep Beckham, as general manager Les Snead detailed in a recent news conference. \"He\u2019s someone that we definitely want back,\" Snead told reporters, per the AP's Greg Beacham. \"A little bit more complex situation based on the injury. We envision it being similar but different circumstances to last year.

It's just a matter of how comfortable they are paying him at this early stage in his recovery from knee surgery. MORE: What's next for Baker Mayfield, Jimmy G after Matt Ryan trade There has been speculation over the last couple of days that the Colts could be a landing spot for Beckham as well. This is fueled by Beckham's opinion of the Matt Ryan trade. Beckham took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to express his approval of Indianapolis' acquisition of Ryan. He stated that he believes Ryan will \"elevate\" the Colts and that the move could be \"special.\" Random thought \u2026. Bruh I really think Matt Ryan to the colts was actually \ud83d\udd25, I think bruh will elevate and do sum special over there. It's unclear whether Beckham was just supporting Ryan or if he was stumping for a position with the Colts. That said, Indianapolis needs help at the receiver position, as it has little across from Michael Pittman Jr. with T.Y. Hilton still an unsigned free agent. MORE: Why the Matt Ryan trade could mimic the Colts signing Philip Rivers So, could the Colts pursue Beckham? Sure.

        "title": "The complicated case for Shawn Marion to make the Basketball Hall of Fame",
        "description": "If you truly dive into The Matrix, you might discover that there's far more to Shawn Marion than what first meets the eye.",
        "text": "Among the most spirited\u00a0\"should he be in the Hall of Fame?\" debates that sprout up every so often is the one regarding Shawn Marion. The former All-Star kicked up the conversation again in 2020,\u00a0telling\u00a0The Athletic's\u00a0Michael Lee \"I should be a shoo-in.\" So... is he right? Should Marion be in the\u00a0Hall of Fame? It's complicated. NBA LEAGUE PASS: Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial) On the surface, he\u2019s not your typical Hall of Fame candidate. Marion made his mark as the second or third-best player on exciting teams that never truly won before eventually winning his lone championship as a role player. He received MVP votes just twice \u2013 in 2004-05 when he finished 14th and 2005-06 when he finished 10th \u2013 which just so happen to come in years when his teammate, Steve Nash, actually won the award. His career averages of 15.2 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.9 assists don\u2019t exactly overpower the senses. He never once finished in the top 10 in scoring and, despite his reputation as a versatile defender, never once made an All-Defense\u00a0team. And yet, Basketball-Reference.com\u2019s trusty Hall of Fame calculator \u2013 which takes into account all sorts of factors including All-Star appearances, championships, how often a player shows up on league leaderboards and a player\u2019s peak, among others \u2013\u00a0gives Marion a 76% of eventually making it. So what gives? What makes Marion\u2019s case compelling that goes beyond the bullet points and back of the basketball card? Let\u2019s dive into the Matrix. We'll dive into what the championship with Dallas means in a bit, but there's no denying that Marion's time in Phoenix stands front and center when it comes to his candidacy. All four of his All-Star selections came in a Suns jersey with the first in 2002-03, two years before\u00a0Nash's arrival ushered in the \"7 Seconds or Less\" era. There's somewhat of a popular misconception that Marion's entire time in Phoenix was spent riding shotgun alongside a two-time MVP, that Marion was more a product of a system than a truly great player on his own merits. Did you know that of Marion's eight full seasons in Phoenix, just three were spent alongside Nash? Though he may have never truly received top billing in his pre-Nash days in the desert \u2014 a distinction that belonged first to Jason Kidd and later Stephon Marbury \u2014 it was Marion that served as the Suns best player before the arrival of the point guard that changed everything in the Valley of the Sun. Following his rookie season, Marion led the Suns in win shares each of the next four seasons,\u00a0during which time he ranked seventh in the NBA\u00a0behind only Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and Tracy McGrady. Think about that for a minute. Before Marion even reached his prime, he was already lurking beneath the surface as a borderline superstar, outperforming all but the very brightest of stars. Then, of course, came three and a half magical seasons alongside Nash, during which Marion cemented his status as an All-Star in the public conscience. His 2005-06 season is one of the forgotten, truly great individual campaigns. Everyone remembers it for Nash winning his second straight\u00a0MVP award while leading the Suns to 54 games despite Amar'e Stoudemire missing almost the entire season. Nobody seems to remember that Marion was spectacular in his own right, averaging career highs in points (21.8) and rebounds (11.8), and playing over 40 minutes a night en route to\u00a0finishing in the top 10 in both MVP and Defensive Player of the Year voting. Marion did absolutely everything over a five-year span, which included that stint with the two-time MVP and\u00a0averaging\u00a0over 20 points, 10 rebounds, two steals and one block per game. Want to know how many other players in NBA history have ever done that over a five-year period? One.\u00a0 Hakeem Olajuwon. That's it.\u00a0 So yeah ... Shawn Marion at his best was a beast. Fair or not, rings matter in terms of how we remember players. Most of the time the conversation revolves around those who never won - Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing and even Nash. But it can also play a pivotal role in swinging Hall of Fame cases for the better. We recently saw it with Jack Sikma, who finally got the call and surely benefited from his one title with Seattle in 1979. We're seeing it right now with Chauncey Billups, a fringe Springfield candidate that could eventually make the cut in part due to that 2004 title with the Pistons. After winning with the Raptors in 2019, Kyle Lowry is gaining some traction on potentially one day making it in. The same goes for Marion, who played an important part on the 2010-11 Mavericks, even if he was past his prime and no longer an All-Star calibre player. The 2011 NBA Finals will best be remembered for Dirk Nowitzki finally breaking through and for LeBron James coming up short in the moment. When it comes to the latter, it's amazing how so much of the focus for the struggles of James are placed squarely on his shortcomings rather than Dallas' defense. It's something that a year after the fact Marion was all too familiar with. It's amazing how nobody wants to give the Mavs credit for playing some amazing defense last year!!! We earn that ring !!! James averaged just 17.8 points per game in that series, over eight fewer than he had in the three previous rounds. Nobody befuddled James more than Marion, whose unique combination of size, speed and length gave him fits. He was every bit as masterful against James as Kawhi Leonard would prove to be years later though gets nowhere near the same level of credit that's rightfully bestowed upon Leonard. Dallas doesn't win that title without Marion, who wasn't merely ring chasing and along for the ride.\u00a0 Using that same\u00a0probability calculator mentioned previously, it's possible to quantify just how big of an impact that championship had on Marion's Hall of Fame worthiness. If you take away that championship in Dallas and keep everything else the same, his chances to make it fall from 76% down to 58%. He moves from being in the same company as Dennis Rodman and Joe Dumars into that of Bobby Wanzer, who eventually made it\u00a0but not for a full 30 years after he last played. There's a chance we're having a Hall of Fame discussion about Marion without the ring, but it's far closer to a half-court heave than a slam dunk. There's a beautiful quirkiness\u00a0to Marion's game that transcends the realm of statistics, be it that bizarre shooting motion or his incredible second jump. Nicknamed \"The Matrix\" by Kenny Smith during the preseason of his rookie year, Marion's unique game stood out from the moment he entered the league. As much as the \"7 Seconds or Less\"\u00a0Suns are credited for changing the game for their ability to push pace, run the floor and fire off 3-pointers at an alarming rate long before that recipe took the league by storm, equally illuminating was the manner in which they deployed Marion. Although it's common now to bring up positionless basketball and spotlight versatile players capable of sliding up and down positions and stretching the floor, that wasn't always the case. When it comes to legitimate \"guard bigs and wings, stretch the floor, run the break\" guys, Marion forged forward as a true pioneer.  How many franchises would have even known what to do with a player as unique as Marion? Rather than rebuilding his shot or shaping him into a traditional forward, the Suns just let Marion be himself, a jack-of-all-trades workhorse that definitely did not fit the bill of your typical early 2000s player. Marion's first All-Star berth in 2002-03 coincided with a newfound confidence to let it fly as he tripled his attempts from beyond the arc while still ranking among the league leaders in steals and ranking first in the NBA in blocks among players 6-foot-7\u00a0or shorter.\u00a0He ranked 26th across the entire league in blocks and did so while\u00a0making nearly as many 3s as the 25 players ahead of him combined. There just wasn't anyone like him. It's also about far more than simply stuffing every column in the box score. He may have been a fantasy basketball superstar, but all of the various combinations of statistical thresholds don't come close to fully articulating his immense value. Had Marion come along in today's modern era of player tracking, it's hard to imagine there being many players \u2014 if any \u2014 that could match his ability to just be everywhere all of the time. He's the type of player that every single team now craves, the amorphous puzzle piece that fits in literally with everyone. Shawn Marion played a 2022 brand of basketball well before anyone else even knew what basketball might look like in 2022. In case you haven't figured out by now, I'm squarely in the camp that Marion deserves a spot in Springfield. During his time in the NBA, The Matrix was himself a glitch in the matrix, the do-it-all star that played in a manner that broke the game. That he's not yet in the Hall of Fame is itself a glitch in the matrix, a wrong that needs to be made right sooner rather than later."

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t LOS ANGELES \u2014 For many artists from communities of color, a creative practice isn\u2019t just about making art; it\u2019s also about larger actions, like speaking up against social injustices and fostering the next generation of artists of color. Brooklyn-based artist Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey, Flower-Headed Children, speaks to this intersectionality, challenging visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.\u00a0 The artist founded the South Asian Women\u2019s Creative Coalition (SAWCC), a nonprofit organization focusing on \u201cadvancement, visibility, and development of emerging and established South Asian womxn artists,\u201d according to its official website. She also previously worked as the director of public events and projects at the Queens Museum of Art, among other contributions to the art world. While some of the pieces in the exhibition are deeply intimate, others capture a collective energy.\u00a0 Jasmine Blooms at Night (2021), an installation composed of multiple portraits, pays homage to South Asian feminist activists throughout the country, including Dr. Anjali Arondekar, who wrote the book For the Record: On Sexuality and the Colonial Archive in India, and queer Sri Lankan performance artist, activist, organizer, and educator YaliniDream. Abichandani highlights the rise of South Asian women in United States politics, in particular Vice President Kamala Harris and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. \u201cKamala\u2019s Inheritance\u201d reflects the artist\u2019s perspective on Harris as a hopeful figure \u2014 a South Asian and Black woman in politics, whose presence will potentially usher in even more women of color \u2014 but also someone with \u201chubris, which can push her toward positions that have more flash than substance,\u201d according to the artwork\u2019s walls text. The symbols in the piece reference Greek mythology, Hindu religion (specifically the lotus flower), and American imperialism. \u201cMona,\u201d a portrait of Mona Eltahawy, likens the journalist to the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet. Eltahawy\u2019s bright red hair fits the overall opulence of the work, comprised of paint, plastic, mirrored glass, and fabric. The portrait expresses her uncompromising personality as she holds up two middle fingers. Other works reference the #MeToo moment, protest, and community action, spotlighting Abichandani\u2019s 2017 performance at the Met Breuer in which she asked 30 people to join her for a #MeToo demonstration. The action took place during photographer Raghubir Singh\u2019s retrospective; Abichandani alleged that Singh assaulted her, and openly shared her story.\u00a0 The exhibition\u2019s text, printed on a bright gold wall, explains that Abichandani\u2019s works \u201cbroaden American art audiences\u2019 appreciation of aesthetics that represent an unfamiliar cultural experience.\u201d The show embraces visual sumptuousness; some pieces glitter from every angle. \u201cUnlike other immigrant communities, South Asians have yet to establish institutions for contemporary art and culture,\u201d the show\u2019s curator, Anuradha Vikram, wrote in an ArtNews article in 2019. \u201cOur institutions tend to be houses of worship, folkloric programs, and schools for the classical arts.\u201d Overall, Vikram explains, \u201cattention devoted to contemporary art by South Asians working in the US is rare.\u201d\u00a0 The show asks viewers to check their assumptions, and question their reactions to each piece. Abichandani argues that South Asian devotional art and queer culture have both been regarded as strange and other within (mostly straight, White) Euro-American society. She embraces and exalts queer culture in the show. \u201cTwo Boys in Saris\u201d (2018) is installed on its own pedestal, painted gold to match the surrounding walls. It showcases the artist\u2019s integration of devotional images with modern queer aesthetics; the jewelry and clothing on each figure nod to Hindu traditions of dressing idols in temples, while elements like bright blue lipstick speak to liberation in fashion. It portrays two queer Muslim performance artists whose poses point to Bollywood themes. \u00a0 \u00a0 The show is a reminder that South Asian contemporary artists are ready to be heard, whether or not institutions want to catch up.\u00a0 Jaishri Abichandani: Flower-Headed Children continues at Craft Contemporary (5814 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California) through May 8. The exhibition is curated by Anuradha Vikram. Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 One of the spookiest objects in Supernatural America: The Paranormal in American Art at the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia) is a wearable reliquary, \u201cMemorial for S.C. Washington\u201d (c. 1789). It contains hair from a dead teenager, along with an image of her spirit breaking free from a tomb. The object exemplifies the ways that the exhibition \u2014 which includes over 150 works from the 18th century to the present, by artists who span all different backgrounds and cultures \u2014elucidates dialogues between past and present, and between this world and realms beyond. The exhibition avoids trivializing artists\u2019 beliefs. One painting, \u201cPrecipitated Portraits of Lizzie, Mary and Christina Daugherty with Dr. Daugherty\u201d (c. 1900), created as part of a seance with medium sisters Mary E. (May) and Elizabeth Snow (Lizzie) Bangs, credits \u201cspirits\u201d along with the Bangs sisters. The painting seems to be haunted.\u00a0Similarly, ghostly double-exposed photographs by spirit photographer William H. Mumler likely catch the viewer\u2019s breath as they did 150 years ago, when Spiritualism, the religious movement that posited the possibility of communication with souls of the dead, was in full swing.\u00a0 These are all part of the exhibition\u2019s first section, which contemplates the United States as a haunted place, encompassing US history and land, and the institution of slavery as foundational to this country.\u00a0 Two visceral abstract heads by Jack Whitten, \u201cHead 1\u201d and \u201cForm (3rd Set) 1\u201d (both 1965), swirl in a fog. The artist believed they carried the spirit of Henry Wells, a freedman lynched in 1878. Painted in the Civil Rights era, they act as spiritual testament to protests against racist violence currently being waged around the country. In her magnetic charcoal and chalk drawing \u201cAcheron\u201d (2016), named for the Greek god of the underworld\u2019s river, Alison Saar depicts the African and diaspora archetype, and mythological water spirit, \u201cMami Wata\u201d (Mother Water) standing up to her waist in water. In the river\u2019s reflection, the basket she carries on her head appears to contain ghoulish skulls. Saar invokes spirits to speak to centuries of violence committed against people of color, while looking to the mythological spirit as a guide to healing and liberation. The second section includes surrealist artists like Dorothea Tanning, whose twisted images of mystical beings in her painting \u201cGuardian Angels\u201d (1946) emanate a mysterious energy. Gertrude Abercrombie\u2019s gothic shadow play in \u201cStrange Shadows (Shadow and Substance)\u201d (1950) is delightfully eerie, while Benjamin West\u2019s 1777 painting, \u201cSaul and the Witch of Endor,\u201d is one of the few Biblical works in the exhibition.\u00a0 Another section focuses on mediumship and contains items like Ouija boards and spirit catchers, while the last section ponders UFOs and dimensions beyond our universe, often based on artists\u2019 personal experiences. Chris Pappan, who is Osage, Kaw, and Cheyenne River Lakota Sioux, turns to UFOs to address the politics of colonialism and white supremacy. Pappan reframes colonialism as an alien attack in \u201cAnother Incident at the Big Chief\u201d (2021) and \u201cSee Haw Directs an Alien Invasion from the West\u201d (1996). The works, rendered on municipal documents from the 1920s, draw from the Native American ledger art tradition, which often illustrated historical events; Pappan\u2019s work offers a kind of alternative history through the alien metaphor.\u00a0 Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power. They reveal the ghosts that linger in our collective psyche. In a time when we are still grappling with the unimaginable losses of COVID-19 and racial reckonings that ignited in 2020, the exhibition asks us to acknowledge, if not necessarily make peace with, our country\u2019s haunted spirit.\u00a0 Supernatural America: The Paranormal in American Art continues at the Minneapolis Institute of Art (2400 Third Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota) through May 15.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t SANTA FE, NM \u2014 In the fashion world, it\u2019s \u201ctaboo\u201d for a designer to share details about a collection that has yet to hit the runway. So when I spoke with fashion designer Patricia Michaels, or Water Lily (Taos Pueblo), she spoke carefully but excitedly about her design company PM Waterlily\u2019s collection for this year\u2019s SWAIA\u2019s Santa Fe Indian Market fashion show. Since 1922, the Santa Fe Indian Market has been the premiere venue for artists coming from tribal nations throughout the United States to show and sell their work. Historically founded to combat the erasure of Indigenous peoples and their cultures, the event transforms the Santa Fe plaza for one weekend in August in celebration and support of Native artists. Water Lily, who has maintained a presence at Indian Market since birth, says, \u201cI feel like the team that I\u2019m building and the team that I\u2019ll continue to work with is right on board with me. They\u2019re excited \u2026 my couture looks that will be on the runway will be exciting, but so will the ready-to-wear.\u201d An alumna of the Institute of American Indian Arts and The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Water Lily\u2019s training also includes apprenticeships with the Santa Fe Opera\u2019s costume designer and a tailor in Milan, Italy. In 2014, she received the prestigious Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian Arts and Design Award. And although Water Lily had been designing for nearly three decades prior, including gaining national recognition for her work in the 2015 Peabody Essex Museum show Native Fashion Now, she found mainstream recognition as runner-up of Project Runway during Season 11. This pop culture appearance brought the designer\u2019s Native-inspired haute couture fashion to New York and audiences around the world \u2014 a historical first. PM Waterlily\u2019s original and innovative designs for the Santa Fe Indian Market centennial incorporate her handmade signature detailing such as dying, painting, felting, and beading that reference \u2014 and sometimes reframe \u2014 the Southwestern landscape and textiles of Northern New Mexico\u2019s Native Pueblo cultures. Her previous collections have featured wools from local Taos farms, sheer fabrics with gestural brushstrokes, black geometric patterns inspired by Anasazi pottery, bright red and rich fuschia of mountain berries and desert blooms, and metallic detailing informed by the micaceous pottery of the region. Glimpses of her designs can be seen on her TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook accounts and at Malouf on the Plaza in Santa Fe. \u201cIt definitely is exciting \u2026 The honor of being able to be at Indian Market \u2014 it\u2019s such an important centennial [and] time in history that I feel a responsibility to heighten my expression,\u201d she says. Currently working outside of Santa Fe, Water Lily joked about the chaos happening in her studio as she juggles the collection for Indian Market and alongside her other projects. For example, she\u2019s been creating costumes for performances by Opera Lafayette (Washington, DC) of Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9ry\u2019s Silvain, which tells a story of farmers in the 1860s in the territory of what today is northern New Mexico. She took on the project in part to incorporate a part of New Mexico culture she has been eager to explore through fashion. Informing her designs for the opera is the art of Spanish colonial New Mexico, ranging from carved and painted woodworking of santero artists (makers of religious imagery) to wool and cotton techniques of colcha embroidery, offering a contemporary interpretation of life and fashion during the state\u2019s territorial period. When I asked her specifically about this year\u2019s centennial Indian Market, she became overwhelmed by what the milestone means for her and for the numerous artists and families that have participated in the market for decades. Thinking about the number of artworks that Indigenous artists have made over 100 years, she says, \u201cWhen you go into Indian Market, just remember that there are prayers in every single piece of art on the plaza.\u201d Adding to this, the artworks at Indian Market are testaments to cultural survival and community resilience, which she and her family carry on with their work.\u00a0\u00a0 While reflecting on her inspirations, Water Lily was candid about the early pushback she received at Indian Market. \u201cWhen I first wanted to do a fashion show and [market organizers] wouldn\u2019t let me because, they said I was taking away from tradition, and I had my booth protested \u2026 I [remained] headstrong about doing a contemporary fashion show.\u201d Despite the resistance to include a fashion show in 1992, she continued to advocate for the opportunity to debut her designs the way they were intended to be shown: on a catwalk. As a fashion designer who is Indigenous, Water Lily refused to conform to rigid demands designated by \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d Native American art \u2014 labels that were invented and implemented by non-Native organizers. Instead, she, like many Native artists, celebrates her culture through dialogues with the past combined with innovation grounded in the world today and in the future. Thirty years later, Indian Market would seem incomplete without the annual fashion show that she adamantly pushed for, and that will hopefully continue for the next 100 years.\u00a0\u00a0 In anticipation of this year\u2019s market, Water Lily mentions that she and her team are celebrating the people they have worked with over the years. The designer says, \u201cThe honor is beyond words of the people who came before me to allow me this space.\u201d Mindful of the Native women that preceded her, she explains, \u201cI have a lot of admiration for women of the past. They were really able to stand their ground in a world that was changing.\u201d And, in the face of such change, \u201cOur cultures were being policed so that we wouldn\u2019t speak the language, we wouldn\u2019t participate in ceremonies,\u201d which then led her to the bigger picture of her creative endeavors. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s part of my inspiration. [The fact that] I can still go home and still be in ceremonies and still bring something contemporary to the market so that I\u2019m not selling my tradition, but I\u2019m making enough so that my tradition still exists.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t SANTA FE, NM \u2014 Each summer, on the weekend following the third Thursday in August, the population of the small city of Santa Fe, New Mexico more than doubles as over 150,000 visitors from around the world converge on the largest juried Native American art event in the world: Santa Fe Indian Market. Now organized by the Southwest Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA), Indian Market was first held in 1922, and as the event prepares to celebrate its centennial anniversary, it has grown to include over 1,200 Indigenous artists from across the United States and Canada. Indian Market, and the many concurrent satellite events which include performances, exhibitions, lectures, screenings, and more, features artists working across an extraordinary variety of media. Although this year\u2019s participating artists are yet to be announced, one thread is continuous: Storytelling is central in much of Native American art, and the work being produced by Indigenous jewelers is no exception. Native jewelry, whether based in historical practice, contemporary innovation, or somewhere in between, carries the identities and histories of the artists and craftspeople who created it; jewelry allows us to carry those stories with us and on us. The work of Alaskan Native Denise Wallace (Chugach Sugpiaq/Alutiiq), a longtime staple of Indian Market, exemplifies these facts. Winner of the Best of Show award for Jewelry at the 2021 Market, stories and histories are at the heart of Wallace\u2019s work. But her winning piece from 2021 Indian Market, Origins, Roots, and Sources, is an impeccable example of her work. The belt, like many of her best-known pieces, utilizes precious metals, custom stonework, scrimshaw, intricate mechanisms, and hidden transformative elements to create works that speak with her unique voice. Featuring masks and figures that, according to Wallace, \u201care based in the history of our country,\u201d she incorporates traditional stories with references to history, environmental fears, and current politics.  The work also contains specific allusions to missing and murdered indigenous women, to two-spirit people, and civil rights leaders Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (the figure representing Ginsburg references the following quote from the late Supreme Court Justice, \u201cI ask no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.\u201d) Wallace\u2019s work here honors the labor and sacrifices of those who came before us, while recognizing that a great deal of work still lies ahead. \u201cI don\u2019t really think of myself as a jeweler,\u201d says Wallace. \u201cI see myself as a storyteller. I\u2019m not just making adornment. There\u2019s history, personal energy, there\u2019s my story.\u201d Speaking of art more broadly she says, \u201cIt\u2019s all about storytelling. We\u2019re continuing our histories and stories. We build on the craft of the people who come before us, and the people who come after will build on top of what we make.\u201dIndigenous adornment practices aren\u2019t limited to jewelry made in precious metal and stones. Indigenous artworks that adorn the body include textiles, beadwork, quillwork, found objects, and more. Hollis Chitto (Choctaw, Laguna and Isleta Pueblos) is an artist who practices traditional beadwork, but the body and its ability to serve as a vessel for histories and identity are central ideas that inform this work. Hailing from Santa Fe, Hollis grew up in an environment surrounded by art. He had his first experience showing work at Indian Market at five years old with his father (esteemed Mississippi Choctaw sculptor and ceramics artist Randy Chitto) and began learning beading at the age of ten.\u00a0 Chitto\u2019s bag \u201cIn Honor of Pukni\u201d references his personal connection to beadwork through his family. \u201cI made this bag in honor of my grandmother. My father\u2019s mother helped provide for her family in Chicago by selling her beadwork,\u201d he explains. The bag features Southeast style abstract floral designs, as well as appliqu\u00e9 in silk ribbon that mimics the diamond pattern found on the backs of rattlesnakes. \u201cAlthough I never had the privilege of learning the art form from her, I believe everything I make is an extension of her love for her family,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhen I asked my dad if pukni would be proud of my work, he said, \u2018She would be blown away, but ask why are you using such small beads?\u2019 \u201d Chitto, who identifies as two-spirit, says of adornment, \u201cWhat we put on our bodies is a statement. It signals identity, culture, gender, socio-economic status and more. What a person wears tells the story of who that person is. It shows who you are to the world and as Indigenous people our identities are wrapped up in storytelling.\u201d His bag \u201cBloodwork No. 2\u201d exemplifies the connection between Indigenous bodies and the stories they carry. This bag features a colorful example of floral beadwork interrupted by a cascade of red evocative of flowing blood, a weighty symbol for Native and LGBTQ2+ people alike. \u201cThe blood in our veins is what gives us life. Its importance is celebrated in various tribes as a fact. Unfortunately, it is this same substance that is at risk for a sickness that is taking a portion of our people,\u201d Chitto says of this work. \u201cThe taboos of speaking openly about unsafe sex and high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use have only served to add to new infection rates due to ignorance. My goal for this piece is to act as a starting point of discussion about this topic. The blood down the center is the elephant in the room; we all have it, so few of us give it a second thought unless we need to.\u201d Speaking on the topic of non-Natives wearing Indigenous adornment, Chitto says, \u201cA lot of bead workers get the question from non-native \u2014 \u2018Is it okay to wear this?\u2019 The question is coming from a good place \u2026 So long as the work is purchased from a Native artist, and so long as you are engaging with the culture respectfully, then you\u2019re good. That interaction and engagement becomes a part of your story.\u201d Denise Wallace echoes this sentiment, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious when people are appropriating culture in a disrespectful way, but when a person buys and wears a piece of jewelry, they are supporting that artist\u2019s community and promoting the culture.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions. He cannot understand why this woman has committed such brutal crimes against men. He says it\u2019s \u201clike a work of fiction\u201d while the other detective on the case says, \u201cNo one can understand why she did what she did.\u201d But I disagree. The reasons for this killing spree that these men can\u2019t account for are clear to me given America\u2019s history of male violence. In the 2003 film Monster, we see Charlize Theron enter into a trauma response every time she gets into a car with a man: She is paranoid and on guard. From what is insinuated of Wuornos\u2019s long history of experiences of abuse by men, this response is to be expected. A triggered woman is not a mystery. Monster succeeds where this docuseries from the perspective of the investigators fails, because it comprehends the pain and abuse that made Wuornos into someone the Catching Killers detectives can\u2019t wrap their heads around. In contrast, the cishet male murderer holds a coveted spot in the cultural imagination. He is typically depicted as worldly wise, having great taste in music and art, for example Hannibal Lecter \u2014 as played by Anthony Hopkins or Joe Goldberg as played by Penn Badgley on the televised series You. These male murderers have instincts to violence that they cannot resist. They are presented as an inevitable evil; they cannot change their predatory nature. When I think of Wuornos, I think also of Elisabetta Sirani\u2019s painting \u201cTimoclea Killing Her Rapist\u201d(1659). Timoclea forcing her attacker down the well is a striking image. His legs are spread apart, mimicking a pose perhaps similar to one he may have forced her into when he assaulted her. With this swift movement, Timoclea shifts the power dynamic. Male violence makes way for the revenge of the oppressed woman. Wuornos may not have chosen the right men for the well, but her anger can definitely be understood. We have too many depictions of male murders, men who kill because they have a compulsive tendency to violence. I want to see more women whose rage knows no bounds, who refuse to turn their hatred into self-destruction. We need to see the cultural history of female violence as a history of retaliation, a fuck-you to the patriarchal violence women consistently experience. We need a space for our anger. Women\u2019s rage deserves to be unpacked and understood as more than bunny boiler hysterics because like Serani\u2019s Timoclea, a woman killing her rapist flips the patriarchal hierarchy, upending the male violence that still dominates perspectives on women in our visual culture. \u00a0 Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t For all the paint fragments found throughout the ancient world, on murals, pottery, sculpture, and scrolls, surprisingly few ancient paint palettes have been uncovered. Ancient palettes in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the British Museum in London, and the Louvre in Paris \u2014 among other institutions \u2014 number in the single digits. This is even more surprising now that scholars know ancient Greek and Roman statues were vibrantly painted.\u00a0 The palettes we do have, many of which still contain traces of original pigment, show us how people painted, but they also tell us about the role of the painter in ancient civilizations. Most of the existing paint boxes and palettes are Ancient Egyptian: They belonged to scribes, tomb painters, and recreational painters of the upper classes. Some include the original brushes \u2014 for scribes, pen-like lengths of rush grass, and for professional and recreational illustrators, thicker bundles of grass to compose larger images. Scribes\u2019 palettes mostly held only red and black pigments and many bear inscriptions of the king\u2019s name, suggesting the importance of the scribe in the eyes of the ruler. Inscriptions with the king\u2019s name \u2014 as in a palette at the British Museum featuring hieroglyphs in high relief that read \u201cthe perfect god, lord of the Two Lands, Nebpehtire, s[on of Ra, Ahmose]\u201d \u2014 may have noted that the owner was the king\u2019s official scribe and suggest that perhaps the king himself gave the palette to the scribe. An Ancient Egyptian painting palette owned by a professional painter and housed at the Met also bears the king\u2019s name, but one at the Cleveland Museum of Art includes the name of the owner himself, signifying it was likely used for leisurely painting. Unlike scribes\u2019 bicolor palettes, recreational and tomb painters used a wider range of colors, all naturally occurring besides so-called \u201cEgyptian blue.\u201d\u00a0 Replacing the expensive lapis lazuli, Egyptian blue was a synthetic compound made by heating malachite, sand, and other materials to a temperature of 1,500-2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The method was adopted by the Ancient Romans, but by the Middle Ages, the process was lost, and painters relied once again on the prohibitively expensive lapis lazuli. In Ancient Egypt, blue was used to paint the gods (red, yellow, black, and green all came from the ground, making them unfit to depict deities). This concept is seen again in Christian art centuries later, with Mary and Jesus repeatedly depicted in blue.\u00a0 Across the world and made centuries after the Egyptian palettes, another ancient paint set links the painter to the divine.\u00a0 A group of pigment jars from Teotihuac\u00e1n, near current-day Mexico City, are arranged in the \u201cquincunx,\u201d an important religious and astrological symbol found throughout ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. In the quincunx, four objects surround a higher central object, which symbolizes the center of the universe. The symbol has been found throughout Teotihuac\u00e1n in arrangements of dots used to calculate time. Scholars have argued that four-sided pyramids, like the central Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuac\u00e1n, reflect the quincunx because the four sets of stairs lead to a higher, sacred site.\u00a0 The Teotihuac\u00e1n culture had no writing system, relying instead on images painted on pottery and murals which used relationships and metaphors to relay meaning. In an essay accompanying the Met\u2019s set of painting jars, the author argues that mixing the colors was seen as a haphazard moral shortcoming, one that would be in contradiction to the jars\u2019 divine quincunx shape. Inscriptions and meaning in paint sets from Ancient Egypt and Teotihuac\u00e1n define them as culturally significant objects and show that their owners too were culturally significant. But despite the clear historical, religious, and political importance of painting and record keeping \u2014 and all of the ancient painted objects in our museums \u2014 it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.\u00a0\u00a0 In an interview with the Atlantic, author of Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color Philip Ball discussed how the study of paint itself is largely outside the realm of traditional art history and criticism. \u201cIt seems to be largely restricted to conservators at museums who, of necessity, have to know something about the material aspects of the works as well as the art-historical context,\u201d Ball said.\u00a0 \u201cBy not understanding these craft aspects of making art, we run the risk of imagining that art is just about having the idea rather than about actually having to go about creating it,\u201d Ball continued. \u201cI do think this is a perspective that has been underplayed in conventional art history and art criticism, and that it could be brought closer to the fore.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

Hecht Jr., who was accused of trafficking in looted art.",
        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t Over the past two decades, Dr. Christos Tsirogiannis has identified upwards of 1,500 looted antiquities by scouring museum holdings and auction house offerings, and matching up objects of dubious provenance with photos taken from the archives of disgraced dealers. Now, the Denmark-based professor, former field archaeologist, vigilante provenance researcher, and repatriation advocate \u2014 whom convicted antiquities trafficker Giacomo Medici characterized as \u201cdoing terrorism toward the auction houses and the museums\u201d \u2014 is calling upon the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles to repatriate an ancient Roman fresco fragment. The 23-by-17 inch painting scrap, he says, is linked to American art antiquities dealer Robert E. Hecht Jr., who was accused of trafficking in looted art. For six decades, Hecht sold Mediterranean antiquities to leading museums and prominent private collectors. He regularly supplied the Getty Museum with artifacts in the 1980s and 1990s and allegedly participated in a tax fraud scheme that involved private collectors donating trafficked antiquities to the Getty. After a raid of Medici\u2019s warehouse of unprovenanced artifacts in 1995, Italy began to investigate Hecht for his part in an international antiquities trafficking operation; Hecht had, for example, acquired a looted Etruscan vase from Medici, which he sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. (It was repatriated in 2006.) Shortly after Medici was convicted in 2004, Hecht was indicted, along with Getty Museum antiquities curator Marion True. For Hecht and True, the multi-year trial ended without a conviction when the statute of limitations on the charges expired. Hecht died shortly after the case ended in 2012. When French and Italian officials raided Hecht\u2019s apartment in 2001, they found his personal memoir along with \u201cletters, antiquities covered with soil and wrapped in plastic shopping bags, as well as Polaroid and regular-print images depicting restored and unrestored antiquities, some still \u2018very dirty with earth,\u2019\u201d Tsirogiannis wrote in his article \u201cNekyia: \u2018Woman on a balcony\u2019 at the Jean Paul Getty Museum,\u201d published in the Journal of Art Crime in December 2019. The researcher \u2014 who has traced numerous artifacts to Hecht, including a helmet currently on offer at Christie\u2019s \u2014 describes a bundle of photographs, connected to one another with string, depicting antiquities ranging from vases to figurines to mosaics.  A fresco fragment currently on view at the Getty Villa was among the antiquities in the photos, he says. \u201cWoman on a Balcony\u201d is believed to be part of a large Roman Second Style wall painting, which perhaps decorated a dining room. It was painted in Italy \u2014 Tsirogiannis suspects that it was made in Pompeii \u2014 sometime between 10 BCE and 14 CE. In the image, a woman in a loose tunic and matching cap drinks from a cup as she balances a pitcher against a balcony railing. The fragment belonged to antiquities collectors Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman, who first exhibited the work publicly with the Getty in 1994 and donated it to the museum \u2014 along with 287 other objects \u2014 in 1996. The Getty also purchased 33 artifacts from the Fleischman collection. Tsirogiannis explains in his article that the Getty recently updated the online provenance for the object and revealed that the Fleischmans acquired the fragment from Fritz B\u00fcrki, who regularly acted as a criminal front for Hecht, according to Tsirogiannis, who cites Peter Watson and Cecilia Todeschini\u2019s 2007 book The Medici Conspiracy. In 2007, two years after the museum\u2019s antiquities curator was indicted for trafficking, the Getty repatriated 40 objects to Italy. One of the objects in the return was a second fresco fragment \u2014 a Pomepiian lunette depicting Hercules \u2014 that the Fleischmans had also acquired from B\u00fcrki, making \u201cWoman on a Balcony\u201d even more suspect. Tsirogiannis brought his findings to the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, which has a task force that is dedicated to fighting antiquities trafficking. \u201cThe next steps regarding the repatriation of the fresco to Italy, belong exclusively to the Manhattan DA\u2019s Office, after I sent them, last January, my academic article \u2026 which includes all the relevant evidence and information,\u201d Tsirogiannis told Hyperallergic. \u201cIt is important that the fresco be returned because it belongs to Italy and because there will be a chance to be re-contextualized,\u201d Tsirogiannis continued. \u201cSooner or later it will help the Italian archaeological service to locate the exact monument and the exact part of a wall at this monument from where originally the fresco was cut off.\u201d Lord Colin Renfrew, a leading archeologist at the University of Cambridge,\u00a0questioned the legitimacy of the fragment\u2019s provenance in 2000 and has recently\u00a0echoed calls for the fragment\u2019s return. \u201cOne can presume it to be looted when it really has no respectable provenance,\u201d Renfrew told the\u00a0Observer. \u201cYou need a provenance going back to the beginning of the century to be of any value.\u201d When Hyperallergic reached out to the museum for comment, a spokesperson said: \u201cGetty continually researches the background and provenance of items within its collection and considers new evidence when it is presented. We have a longstanding policy of returning objects to their country of origin or discovery when the research indicates it is warranted.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t In early March, New York Mayor Eric Adams released a blueprint for a plan to rebuild the city\u2019s economy after two devastating years of COVID-19. Recognizing that arts and culture are key catalysts for the recovery of the city\u2019s financial health, the plan announced a \u201cCulture at Risk\u201d response team to assist arts and nightlife businesses on the brink of closure and a \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d cultural district on Governors Island.  Just a month earlier, however, the mayor released a preliminary budget for fiscal year 2023 that proposes slashing one-third of the city\u2019s culture budget. So how does the mayor\u2019s grandiose rhetoric about New York\u2019s cultural comeback match up with his budgetary policy?  The \u201cRebuild, Renew, Reinvent\u201d plan blueprint aims to \u201caccelerate\u201d NYC\u2019s economic recovery through investment in the small business, tourism, and arts and culture sectors. With 400,000 jobs lost since the pandemic hit in 2020, the plan states restoring employment in the city to a \u201cpre-pandemic level\u201d as its primary goal.   As expected of Mayor Adams, who ran for office on a tough-on-crime\u00a0platform, one of the prerequisites to \u201crestarting the city\u2019s economic engines\u201d is tackling public safety concerns including gun violence and homelessness. The plan also calls on employees to return to in-person work, another message the mayor has pushed aggressively for months. In a style reminiscent of former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, the document is interspersed with flattering images of Adams shaking hands with workers and small business owners, posing for the camera holding signed paperwork, and overlooking the city\u2019s skyline from a skyscraper window.  New York\u2019s arts sector was among the hardest hit during the pandemic, per a\u00a0report by the state comptroller\u00a0from last February. The report found that two-thirds of all arts, entertainment, and recreation jobs in the city vaporized in 2020. An even deeper crisis\u00a0faces immigrant artists\u00a0in the city, who report diminished livelihood\u00a0sources with little to no aid from local authorities.\u00a0 In a survey of 643 community-based New York arts organizations conducted by Americans for the Arts and published by the think tank Center for an Urban Future (CUF) last year, one-quarter of all cultural organizations located in lower-income zip codes across the city reported losing access to their only physical space during the pandemic.  \u201cThe blueprint comes at an incredibly pivotal time for the arts,\u201d said Eli Dvorkin, CUF\u2019s editorial and policy director, in an interview with Hyperallergic. \u201cWe see, for example, that even as performing arts employment has been ticking back up in recent quarters, it\u2019s still down about 36% from 2019.\u201d  Dvorkin welcomed the proposals in the blueprint but expressed doubts as to whether they would be backed with sufficient funding. \u201cThere are some really positive things in this blueprint but not much of it will be possible without allocating some real funding behind it,\u201d he said. The city\u2019s preliminary $98.5 billion budget for fiscal year 2023, unveiled in mid-February, focuses on slashing spending in favor of a record level of budget reserves. It allocates $145.5 million for the city\u2019s Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA), down from $230.1 million in 2022. The $84.6 million cuts, which amount to 36.8% of the DCLA\u2019s 2022 budget, include the loss of $12 million in one-time federal funding last year that was used to support the city\u2019s $25 million WPA-style City Artist Corps program. Still, it\u2019s a major hit for the DCLA, which would receive $72 million less in city funding in the coming fiscal year.  Meanwhile, the city\u2019s Correction Department would enjoy a funding increase from about $800 million to $1.2 billion, and the New York Police Department\u2019s budget would remain flat. The DCLA, known as the country\u2019s largest\u00a0cultural funding agency, gets 99.8% of its financial support from the city. If approved, the 2023 budget would take away almost $57 million from the agency\u2019s grantmaking funds, limiting its ability to continue supporting over 1,200 cultural organizations and thousands of individual artists in its constituency. To further complicate matters, last week, Adams appointed Laurie Cumbo, a former council member with a history of racially insensitive remarks, to head the DCLA. Cumbo notoriously opposed legislation that grants noncitizens in the city the right to vote and has made controversial statements about NYC\u2019s Asian and Jewish communities. Against this backdrop, the recovery plan blueprint commits to \u201cfostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive creative sector.\u201d  In an email to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for the DCLA wrote: \u201cIn the Mayor\u2019s\u00a0preliminary\u00a0budget\u00a0proposal, the Department of Cultural Affairs continues to invest in our city\u2019s cultural community while finding savings and efficiencies along with our colleagues across city government. There is no recovery for New York City without\u00a0culture, and we\u00a0look forward\u00a0to working with all partners on the collaborative\u00a0budget\u00a0process in the months ahead.\u201d The city\u2019s most ambitious plan for the arts in the blueprint is a 10-year initiative to build a cultural district on Governors Island, established in repurposed former military homes. The new complex will include exhibition spaces, offices, and will host an artist residency. The city is also poised to launch a \u201cGovernors Island Arts\u201d campaign, announcing upcoming art installations, cultural events, and programming starting this summer. The promised \u201cCulture at Risk\u201d response team will help arts organizations facing closure navigate government bureaucracy and secure financing assistance, according to the blueprint. The initiative is modeled on a similar program launched by the London City Hall in 2016 and expanded during the pandemic. In 202o, London City injected \u00a32.3 million\u00a0(~$3 million) into the program and has since saved hundreds of businesses and nonprofits from closing.    The blueprint also promises to reform the work of the DCLA\u2019s Cultural Development Fund (CDF), its major grantmaking program. This includes allowing multi-year funding for all grantees; efforts to diversify the panel review process; ensuring equity in CDF funding criteria; and \u201cexploring the possibility\u201d of allowing funds to be used for general operating expenses. If implemented, these strategies could help small and mid-size arts organizations in the city that have long struggled to gain access to city funding. Mayor Adams\u2019s preliminary budget will have to go through a series of hearings and discussions in the NYC Council before it\u2019s finally adopted in May or June.   \u201cEvery year, there\u2019s a budget dance, where the mayor\u2019s budget comes lower and city council puts money back in, and there\u2019s usually a dramatic swing from the preliminary budget to the adopted budget at the end of the budget negotiations,\u201d Dvorkin told Hyperallergic. \u201cBut this time around, it\u2019s not clear at all that the DCLA would escape some pretty serious cuts.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note\u00a03/23/22, 1:14pm EDT:\u00a0This article has been updated with a comment from a spokesperson for the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t At 9:30am today, March 22, around a dozen members of the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) Union held a demonstration right off the front steps leading up to the historic entrance of the museum. They held placards that read \u201cGuarding the Guards\u201d \u2014 a rewording of the exhibition title Guarding the Art, curated by the museum\u2019s security guards and opening to press at the same time as their action. Other signs said \u201c1 Voice 1 Union,\u201d \u201cWall-to-Wall Union Election,\u201d and \u201cSign Our Union Election Agreement Now.\u201d The workers\u2019 goal was to put pressure on museum Director Christopher Bedford to sign the City of Baltimore\u2019s union election agreement, which workers say he received two months ago. Without his signature, workers cannot vote to certify their union \u2014 which a petition on BMA Union\u2019s website claims a majority of eligible staff support. The hourlong demonstration was sandwiched into a packed day for the workers. Many of them had just come from a meeting with Bedford and Chief Operating Officer Christine Dietz, and some were headed back to the museum to work on a show curated by many of the same guards who are advocating for unionization.  \u201cWe were trying to co-opt and piggyback on the media preview day for the Guarding the Art exhibition,\u201d Dereck Mangus, a security guard at the museum, told Hyperallergic.  \u201cThe union has basically tried to put their money where their mouth is,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s like, all right \u2014 we agree with [the museum\u2019s] progressive vision and we acknowledge projects like\u00a0Guarding the Art\u00a0are in good faith, and a small step in the right direction. But we need to extend this to all departments, not just guards \u2014 and to have a union.\u201d The meeting this morning followed a more adversarial all-staff email from Bedford sent on March 10, also posted on BMA\u2019s website, that indicated museum leadership was unwilling to conduct an election through the city because it vested too much authority in a third-party arbitrator. In that same email, Bedford also reportedly encouraged workers to consider conducting the union election through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). But that option is categorically unappealing to BMA staff because the NLRB retains a rule they consider antiquated, which would prevent the union from representing both security guards and the rest of the museum\u2019s workers.  \u201cThe purpose of that email really was to cause confusion around this process,\u201d a spokesperson for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) told Hyperallergic. \u201cHow can you celebrate the security guards, but in the same breath, exclude them by suggesting this process?\u201d  The spokesperson added that BMA workers were \u201creally happy \u2026 to get their messages across\u201d this morning, \u201cboth in their meeting with Bedford and publicly out in the open.\u201d An email from the union sent to leadership and the board of trustees this afternoon, reviewed by Hyperallergic, said that Bedford expressed \u201csupport of guards and non-guards being in one unit\u201d during the meeting. The action today was the BMA Union\u2019s first physical demonstration since they first publicized their intention to form a union in September of last year, with the goals of improving job security, wages, accountability, and health and safety protections at the museum. Workers also cited their desire to be included in conversations around reopening during the pandemic and their interest in pushing the BMA to realize its own vision of becoming a more diverse and equitable institution \u2014 a promise made under Bedford\u2019s leadership in 2020, when he controversially proposed deaccessioning three major works in the museum\u2019s collection to fund equity initiatives. Within days of launching the campaign, the BMA Union won the support of a majority of museum workers. On October 5, a blog post on AFSCME\u2019s website formally announced the BMA Union\u2019s intention to unionize with AFSCME Council 67, the local Baltimore-based chapter of the largest trade union of public employees in the United States. The workers additionally officially requested a union election through the city of Baltimore in October. Mangus, who has written about museum unions and about his experience curating Guarding the Art for Hyperallergic, added that they \u201cgot close to meeting halfway\u201d with museum leadership during the talks today. But there is additional concern that museum leadership will drag their feet over the next few months given that Bedford will be leaving the BMA to assume the helm at the San Francisco Museum of Art (SFMOMA) \u2014 a unionized museum \u2014 in June.  \u201cThey drag us along through these processes and stall, just to induce fear or even apathy,\u201d Mangus said. He cited efforts across town at the Walters Art Museum, which have also been stonewalled by similar tactics employed by museum leadership. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the BMA sent Hyperallergic a link to the March 10 statement, which says that \u201ca city-run election, as was requested by BMA union organizers, is not a viable option.\u201d \u201cThe BMA\u2019s board and leadership will respect the outcome of a vote and will continue to work with staff toward greater equity, regardless of that outcome,\u201d the statement says. The opening of Guarding the Art provides a perfect backdrop for workers to distill the essence of their motivation to unionize \u2014 capturing in a nutshell both the unique opportunities they have, but also the challenges they continue to face, as staff members at purportedly progressive institutions desperate to prove their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Seventeen members of the BMA\u2019s security team co-curated the show, selecting works that were particularly meaningful to them. They will also participate in talks and Q&As in late April to discuss their work on the project. \u201cWe are de-privileging people who usually have the power like curators, and privileging people who don\u2019t have that kind of agency and power as guards,\u201d Rob Kempton, a security guard who was also a Guarding the Art curator, told Hyperallergic. \u201cIt\u2019s a very kaleidoscopic show. It is diverse in its offering, showcasing different art historical canons and time periods.\u201d Kempton added that he hoped this show would \u201cspark a torch\u201d at other museums.\u00a0 Now that guards are questioning long unquestioned labor hierarchies at museums, obliterating the artificial divide between service and curatorial positions, they are seizing the moment to demand better labor conditions.  \u201cWe want livable wages and to be able to live well. It\u2019s not that we aren\u2019t, but I find it hard to save \u2014 I\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Kempton said. \u201cI think our efforts are warranted, and we aren\u2019t going to go down without a fight.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

Maguire, an internationally renowned artist represented by galleries in New York City, Chicago, Dublin, and Paris, has worked closely with museum staff to put together this survey exhibition. Through painting, Maguire hopes to draw attention to marginalized voices and human rights atrocities on large canvases. \u201cThe goal of my work is public outrage,\u201d he said. Over the course of his career, he has spent time in Aleppo, Syria; Bentiu, South Sudan; S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico; Tucson, Arizona; and other locations. He visits and listens with families of displaced or missing peoples and works with professionals on the frontlines of these migratory and geopolitical issues, aiming to harness a journalist\u2019s attention to detail and humanity with his artistic talent during his travels. This exhibition unites several recent bodies of work. Maguire\u2019s techniques are striking, with the intention of evoking intense, almost visceral, responses in the viewer. Bombed-out buildings depicted in dripping paint characterize his Aleppo series from 2017. Additional paintings in the show reference immigration and refugee crises, border crossings, and drug wars in Mexico. Maguire tackles these profound issues with strokes of vibrant color. \u201cBrian\u2019s power as an artist is his ability to illuminate stories that otherwise go untold,\u201d said curator Brandon Reintjes. The exhibition includes loans from the Tia Collection in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Fergus McCaffrey Gallery in New York, New York; Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago, Illinois; Kerlin Gallery in Dublin, Ireland; and collectors Christian Groenke and Gulia Bruckmann. Exhibition support comes from Culture Ireland, Fergus McCaffrey Gallery, and the Williams family of Missoula.

Two showcases will highlight their work in Boston University Art Galleries\u2019s Faye G., Jo, and James Stone Gallery. MFA Thesis Exhibitions kicked off with the MFA Painting and Sculpture showcase, which is open through April 2. The MFA Graphic Design exhibition will be on view April 13\u201329 with an opening reception at Stone Gallery on April 15 from 5 to 7pm. Lucy Kim, associate professor of art and interim chair of graduate studies in painting and David Snyder, assistant professor of art and chair of graduate studies in sculpture share the following about the students\u2019 work and resilience while navigating the uncertainty a pandemic can bring: This remarkable group of students started their MFA journey in the Fall of 2020, optimistic that the confusion and uncertainty of a global pandemic would soon fade. Although these hopes proved false, these artists persevered in their studios and classes and continued to learn, expand, make, break, scream, cry, laugh, sigh, and wonder what it even means to make art in this moment. After the tumult and uncertainty of the past two years, they realize that they are re-entering a landscape that has fundamentally shifted. As their faculty, it has been an honor to be a part of their journey and privy to their individual stories. The works in this exhibition point to where each artist started nearly two years ago, to a point of arrival today, and to where they may be heading. The strength of their efforts suggests an overwhelming potential that fills us with hope. Learn more about Boston University School of Visual Arts and the 2022 MFA Thesis Exhibitions.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t LOS ANGELES \u2014 Leonardo da Vinci once explained how important it was for artists to understand anatomy. Some poorly drawn bodies, he wrote, \u201cseem a sack full of nuts rather than the surface of a human being.\u201d Happily, Flesh and Bones: The Art of Anatomy at the Getty Research Institute has selected the more accurate and exquisite anatomical illustrations from the 16th century onwards. The exhibition revivifies past views of bodies and provokes continued exploration of how we understand our human mechanics. Fittingly, the corporeal show opens with death. \u201cThe Living Dead,\u201d the first of six sections, explains how the visual tradition of the skeletal \u2018dance of death\u2019 reminded viewers of their mortality. This motif lingered in posed and animated anatomies of the early modern era, like a hunched, prayerful skeleton by Domenico Bonaveri. Other mesmerizing images include a woodcut illustrating nerves snaking away from a skeleton\u2019s bones as if electrified, and a depiction of the uncanny fetal assemblages of Cornelis Huyberts, who arranged infant skeletons around a stony landscape and originally included morbid captions about mortality. The era\u2019s new possibilities in printing and humanism spurred stronger interest in mapping the body, Monique Kornell, curator and author of the accompanying catalogue, explained to Hyperallergic in an interview. This change was embodied in Andreas Vesalius\u2019s seminal 1543 anatomical treatise De Corpus Fabrica Humani Libri Septum, colloquially known as De Fabrica, which included over 200 intricate anatomical woodcuts that differed from classical views of the body. The fascination with depicting the body and how it worked allowed physicians to better understand and heal it. A section on \u201cAnatomy for Artists\u201d explains how anatomy classes and dissections were incorporated into Renaissance artistic education. Partnerships between anatomists and artists, like the perfectionist Bernhard Siegfried Albinus and the imaginative Jan Wandelaar, generated prints of meticulous bodies set against vivid landscapes. \u201cAnatomy and the Antique\u201d shows how ancient statues were dissected in drawings; artists turned to classical works like the Apollo Belvedere as anatomical and artistic models. The show neatly reinforces these connections by placing a Roman torso from the Getty collection next to a woodcut from De Fabrica that illustrates abdominal organs spilling from a similar statue. Anatomical models depicted idealized bodies, with flaws smoothed out. The value placed on certain body types was reinforced in their images: the ideal figures of Apollo and Venus in Greco-Roman tradition, and Adam and Eve in Christianity, proliferated images of muscular men and fleshy, fertile women down the centuries. Although the drawings were meant to represent ideal humans, anatomists often sought or stole bodies for dissection that were deemed of less value, including those of people convicted of crimes. While the show touches on this complexity, it does not delve into pathological anatomy, drawings of bodies that deviated from the ideal based on shape or because of disease. It would be fascinating to see the topic addressed in a subsequent exhibition that builds from this foundation. The show\u2019s wealth of material leads visitors to consider the body on a number of levels, from a section on \u201cSurface Anatomy\u201d explaining how artists like Leonardo surmounted drawing the body to anatomical models with deeper dimensionality in \u201cSeeing in 3D.\u201d The thematic organization also intermixes a few contemporary works. OG Abel\u2019s 2012 \u201cLove and Hate\u201d evokes Dia de los Muertos makeup in counterpoint to the first section\u2019s representations of death, while Tavares Strachan\u2019s pulsating neon skeleton \u201cRobert\u201d (2018) memorializes the first Black American astronaut, Robert Lawrence, in the final section of the show. They are stirring works, though more context may have helped them feel as cohesive as the rigorous research in the rest the show. \u201cEverybody\u2019s interested in their body,\u201d Kornell said. Getting \u201cinside the body tells who we are, how we work, [and] how we\u2019ve figured that out over the centuries.\u201d Even today, when imaging technology can provide all kinds of anatomical illumination, illustrations still provide useful ways of slicing and dicing (so to speak) to clarify the body\u2019s relevant details. As the show reveals, art translates the complexity of the body to make legible whichever aspects of it we most need to understand.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t In the spring of 2021, the New York-based Italian artist Adelita Husni Bey spent six weeks meeting over Zoom with Danish and American nurses, who recalled their experiences of deplorable working conditions and the consequent physical and psychological depletion in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting 30-minute video, On Necessary Work (2021), is part of Husni Bey\u2019s exhibition, These Conditions, currently at the Annex at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Coney Island, presented by the Vera List Center for Art and Politics, as part of the artist\u2019s two-year fellowship project, The School of Pandemics. Curated by Eriola Pira and Carin Kuoni, the show also includes a sound installation, a room filled with work centered on the AIDS crisis, another room remade as a domestic space, a two-month-long political-theater workshop with necessary workers, and live performances. The Annex was eerily quiet the day I visited. Without realizing that it had been built as a supply base during the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the emptiness of the exposed-concrete basement nevertheless struck in me an unsettling chord, offset by a beatific light streaming through windows \u2014 a fitting contrast, since the show itself pairs the resurgence and persistence of grief and trauma with a yearning to find commonality in pain, and to move not past but through it.\u00a0 Some of the issues the nurses raised rang familiar from news coverage over the past two years: stories of loneliness, numbing daily routines, a corporate takeover of public health, and pressures to cut costs, which left hospital workers toiling beyond the already inhumane hours \u2014 as one nurse put it in the video, it felt as if working in urgent care were like \u201cflipping burgers.\u201d All workshop participants were women, so their complaint that hospital workers are \u201cthe lowest of the lowest rung\u201d in healthcare had an acute sting of institutional gender bias. The women found a visual-spatial metaphor to express the absurd dissonance between being the desperately needed \u201cessential\u201d workers, yet seeing their work devalued: A hand enters the frame before the camera and yanks an item from a stack of objects, causing its collapse. Husni Bey\u2019s art-political environment evokes an echo chamber, especially striking since so much of what it reverberates is the anguish of silence and absence. The artist herself suggests this idea in the video, when she tells the nurses that their conversations \u2014 and the videos they shared \u2014 made her think of \u201ca kind of ghost.\u201d She follows her comment with extreme close-ups split across three screens of a nurse\u2019s uniform, the camera slowly traveling up until it zooms out, in a framing that suggests depersonalization, but also a pervasive, disembodied haunting. Maybe the challenge then is not to exorcise the ghost \u2014 as we might rush to do after a trauma \u2014 but to find metaphors and tangible manifestations that capture its collective \u201csilent roar.\u201d\u00a0 The impact of the show hinges on sensory deprivation not as a hindrance but as a pathway to restoration, starting with the space\u2019s austerity, which suggests a kind of ante-room of feeling \u2014 or so it seemed to me as I wandered into the \u201cliving room,\u201d delineated by plywood walls. The spare space contained a sofa, a table, a locker, and a few drawings in childlike hand. Rather than something to look at, it struck me as a holding place. (I later learned from Husni Bey that two workshop participants conceived it to recreate their own environments.) Nevertheless, having recently lost my father to COVID-19, I felt a peculiar ownership of it, and a tug of disquiet.\u00a0 The phrase \u201csilent roar\u201d comes from a violinist in Husni Bey\u2019s sound work in five movements, Cronaca del Tempo Ripetuto (A chronicle of histories repeating, 2021) \u2014 five improvisations, in collaboration with Chamber Orchestra of Radicondoli, Tuscany, and the participation of Rab\u00e8l Theatrical Association, in response to pandemic lockdown \u2014 also featured in the show. In the accompanying libretto, the artist cites a book by the Italian writer Constantino Antichi, which describes gravediggers during the 1631-33 plague in Italy carrying bodies on stretchers, to avoid carts rattling on cobblestones \u2014 eliminating sound to counter fear. As an antidote to this silencing, Husni-Bey reinstates the deliberately staggered, piercingly solitary notes. Husni Bey\u2019s varied approaches make it harder to define her aims \u2014 what we often call the \u201cpay-off,\u201d following capitalist terminology \u2014 but her work does address the need for \u201crecovery.\u201d In the video, Cady Chaplin, a nurse from Chicago, speaks of crying when a coworker held her, as she suddenly realized she hadn\u2019t been touched in months. But the video\u2019s formal devices \u2014 a split screen, a multiplicity of windows \u2014 leaves open the question of whether or not Zooming provides a sense of connection. There was more closeness in the live performance\u2019s dedicated close-eyed movement exploration, by the group Duvet. In the two parts I saw, a dancer first moved about the space blindfolded, while an accompanying guide prevented him from bumping into walls; then two female dancers performed, and at one point became entangled in each other\u2019s arms. Body as armor, as protector, as a \u201cnurse,\u201d came to my mind, while in the adjacent space \u2014 another plywood room \u2014 The Ashes Action (DIVA TV, 1992), a video documenting an ACT UP! protest, showed gay men locking arms in a body wall, to prevent the police from picking them out, one by one.\u00a0 The ACT UP! video was the one element in the show that directly reflected Husni Bey\u2019s interest in social movements, and specifically social change, in the wake of crises. (Although one might ask what exactly has changed in public response to them \u2014 if anything, the show\u2019s historical timeline stresses a tragic recurrence, with public health in the grip of pharmaceutical lobbies and profiteers, rather than undergoing a meaningful labor reform or empathic evolution.) In this sense, the show\u2019s current configuration doesn\u2019t yet fully delve into the sociopolitical dimension of Husni Bey\u2019s practice. It may in the future, when she presents the video she\u2019s currently making of the political-theater workshop, conducted in the space with a small group of necessary workers (it\u2019s slated to premiere at the New School in the fall of 2022, and then at Castello di Rivoli in Turin, Italy). As she described it to me, it reflects her research on past pandemics and the workers\u2019 experiences. What\u2019s already clear, though, is the ambition of Husni Bey\u2019s multivalent practice. It pushes art to be more than an exercise in spectatorship. Even if I\u2019m not sure how sounds and other metaphors for the pandemic (all of which we so urgently need to survive it) may become a platform for broader social change, These Conditions nevertheless resonates as a passionately pedagogic, interdisciplinary laboratory for communal knowledge. These Conditions continues at the Annex at the Brooklyn Army Terminal (80 58th St, Sunset Park, Brooklyn) through April 8. The exhibition was curated by Eriola Pira and Carin Kuoni with curatorial assistance by Camila Palomino.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t Autofiction has been a novelistic genre for nearly half a century, initially gaining prominence in France, but since 2008, its popularity has exploded worldwide. Claus Elholm Andersen, who is finishing up a book on Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd, recently appeared on the High Theory podcast, where he shared his opinion that when society is confronted with the idea that it is based on fictions (as seen in the wake of the financial crisis), people then turn to fiction as a means of telling the truth. With his newest film, Ahed\u2019s Knee, Israeli director Nadav Lapid explores such themes through a heavily autobiographical story about personal tragedy and state censorship.\u00a0 The title refers to Ahed Tamimi, a young Palestinian activist who made international headlines after a video of her slapping Israeli soldiers went viral. The lead character, a director known only as \u201cY.\u201d (Avshalom Pollak) wants to use cinema to expose the continued lies and illusions Israel has built its statehood upon. The story opens with Y. auditioning actresses for the role of Ahed, who is to be the subject of his next work. With an editing style reminiscent of late \u201960s Godard, Ahed\u2019s Knee deconstructs the boundaries between bodies, temporalities, and spaces as part of a polemic against Israeli state censorship. The film is structured visually around placid suburbs that feel alien in the desert. Y. is taking a break from production on his movie about Tamimi to present a screening of a previous work at a small-town library. But a few hours before, Yohalom (Nur Fibak), a friendly young Ministry of Culture worker, hands him a form outlining which topics he\u2019s allowed to discuss at the post-screening Q&A. If he doesn\u2019t uphold the agreement, he won\u2019t be paid. Y. decides to leverage his position to expose the Ministry for its censorship, even if doing so ruins Yohalom\u2019s career. Ahed\u2019s Knee explores the complexity of how \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cnice\u201d people often find themselves as the face of oppression. Y. likes Yohalom; they flirt and discuss art. He understands that she\u2019s well-intentioned and doesn\u2019t like what she\u2019s asking him to do. On the other hand, he\u2019s curt and aloof, cold and snobbish. His sexual appetites are ravenous, often uncaring. He\u2019s internalized his disgust with Israeli society by becoming almost monstrous himself, particularly after the recent loss of his mother. He\u2019s torn over his conviction to violate his contract because Yohalom is a cog in a system, and it\u2019s unclear whether taking a political stand will even do anything beyond further strain his relationship with state arts funding and take away her future. The story is a battleground of moral debate. Lapid doesn\u2019t waver on the idea that Israel is an oppressor \u2014 the question is instead what constitutes the best, most ethical way to fight the system, and what it means to be a product of such an environment.\u00a0 Y. is the latest in a series of similar \u201cY\u201ds and Yoavs present in nearly every one of Lapid\u2019s films, each of whom are fictional stand-ins for an artist grappling with his identity. The Yoav of his previous movie, 2019\u2019s Synonyms, immigrates from Israel to France and refuses to speak Hebrew in an attempt to distance himself from militarization and state violence. In contrast, this Y. has to grapple with the truth that \u201cgeography wins,\u201d and we can\u2019t escape our homelands. Both Y. and Lapid were born and raised in Tel Aviv. Besides Tamimi, a heavy inspiration was the \u201cLoyalty in Culture\u201d bill, which would have revoked government funding for any artist who would \u201ccontravene the principles of the state.\u201d And around that same time, Lapid\u2019s own mother died. The story is based directly on an experience Lapid had showing his film The Kindergarten Teacher in a small town. Much as Andersen argues, Lapid\u2019s engagement with autofiction seems born from disillusionment. His repeated insertion of himself into these works becomes a study in a man whose identity is tied so closely to a society built on oppression.\u00a0 Ahed\u2019s Knee thus acts like an exorcism, a reckoning with political obligation and what it means to be good on a social versus an interpersonal level. The unmade film within a film about Ahed Tamimi becomes commentary on how artists can use the stories of others to evade true self-reflection. In contrast to Synonyms, this is a story about someone who has stopped running from their past. Ahed Tamimi\u2019s story does not belong to Lapid, but the responsibility of dismantling Israel\u2019s oppression of Palestinians does not lie only with Palestinians. Ahed\u2019s Knee is now playing in select theaters. Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t In late May 2022, the Swedish pop group ABBA will open a seven-month residency in London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, or, at least, their digital representations will. Almost 40 years after their last music release, ABBA announced in September 2021 that they would begin \u201cperforming\u201d again as digital avatars called ABBAtars. The ABBAtars, created from filming the four singers of ABBA in motion capture over eight weeks, de-ages the pop group to their 1979 selves in order to \u201cperform at [their] very best,\u201d according to the band\u2019s website. London audiences are invited to see ABBA in their glory, in a concert that would never have existed during their heyday. This turn towards digital performance is not wholly new in the music industry, where deceased musicians like Tupac Shakur and Michael Jackson have both become projected figures in guest appearances at music festivals and award shows. It is also not new in the field of museums, where the Illinois Holocaust Museum has had holograms of Holocaust survivors relating their testimony since 2017 through the Survivor Stories Experience exhibit. Fearing that the loss of physical dialogue will remove the critical work of remembering past atrocities, the holograms at the Illinois Holocaust Museum are intended to preserve the testimony and memory of survivors. Both the ABBAtars and the Holocaust survivor holograms attempt to recreate presence. The existence of these types of performance requires us as audience members to consider what digital representations, from musical acts to the sharing of testimonials, can actually provide when it comes to engaging with the past. The motion capture of ABBA for concert performances and the Holocaust survivor holograms have different aims, but their use of curation, reinterpretation, and technology make them intriguing examples of this phenomenon. The ABBAtars are creating, per the band\u2019s own language, \u201cthe concert [they\u2019ve] always wanted you to have.\u201d This concert was not one ABBA would have performed in 1979, not only because they won\u2019t be physically present, but also because they can perform songs from their new album Voyage (2021) as their 1979 digitized selves. The singers, now in their 70s, can have their performances live on for fans who were not born during their peak of success, and they can do so while explicitly making the type of presentation they want their audiences to see. The past is in the present, even when it should be impossible. The holograms of Holocaust survivors at the Illinois Holocaust Museum, on the other hand, demonstrate what happens when digitized performance is based in audience interaction. In participating in the Survivor Stories Experience, audience members can ask questions of the hologram they choose. Mediated by a docent, the voice recognition software allows a visitor to get an answer from a hologram, and selects for the visitors what stories they may hear from Holocaust survivors who agreed to be rendered in such a way. Unlike how the ABBAtars are purported to function, these holograms are in some way reactive to the people who come to see them. The testimony they bring forth is limited by what was filmed and collected, but it nevertheless captures some of the memories of survivors before they pass away. Holograms, however, cannot fully recreate flesh and blood live performance or testimony, and what they offer only reminds us that these types of audience interaction cannot fully animate the past. When I visited the Illinois Holocaust Museum in 2018, the survivor I \u201cspoke\u201d to, Aaron Elster, had recently passed away and the museum was showing his testimony as tribute to his life and work. It was all too clear, sitting in the auditorium, that I was watching not the man, but his recorded memories about his trauma. While this fact did not diminish the power of his testimony, I knew that the hologram could not match the physical man digitally rendered in front of me. It is a blessing to have the technology (from the USC Shoah Foundation) to have Elster\u2019s testimony in such a captivating way, but it cannot bridge the loss of him fully. The ABBAtars will likely be confronted with a similar phenomenon when they debut this May. A digitized version of ABBA will certainly be a sight to behold and will most likely create the party that the band is hoping for over seven months in London. But they, and any digitally rendered performance of this ilk, cannot hope to capture the past in the ways that they may wish to. What they can offer, though, is a very different way for audiences to engage with the past that can supplement all the other avenues we already know.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t An iconic 1964 silkscreen portrait of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol, estimated at $200 million \u2014\u00a0which, if achieved, would make the painting the most expensive 20th-century painting to be sold at auction \u2014 is headed to Christie\u2019s in May. Titled \u201cShot Sage Blue Marilyn,\u201d the painting belongs to a series commonly known as the Shot Marilyns, comprised of four individual portraits of the star whose name became synonymous with the manic hypersexualization of famous women in 1950s and \u201960s Hollywood culture. Each square canvas in the series measures 40 by 40 inches, with identical facial outlines and backgrounds painted variously red, orange, light blue, and sage blue. After the actress died from a drug overdose that was ceaselessly sensationalized in the media, Monroe became one of Warhol\u2019s favorite subjects throughout the 1960s, with all of his paintings of her using the same Niagara (1953) publicity photo. Examples hang in some of the most prestigious institutions in the world, including the Tate in London and the Cleveland Museum of Art.\u00a0 The Shot Marilyns got their name when performance artist and friend-of-a-friend Dorothy Podber visited Warhol at his New York studio, which he called the Factory. Noticing a stack of freshly-painted works, Podber asked Warhol if she could shoot them. Warhol, assuming that she was asking for permission to photograph them, said yes, before Podber drew out a revolver and shot a bullet through the foreheads of the Marilyns. A few years later, Valerie Solanas would shoot and nearly kill Warhol at the Factory, imbuing the paintings\u2019 scars with additional significance. Christie\u2019s will be auctioning the work in a philanthropic sale to benefit the new Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation Z\u00fcrich, which a press release describes as \u201cdedicated to improving the lives of children the world over by establishing support systems centered on providing healthcare and educational programs.\u201d The Ammanns were siblings and ran a gallery in Z\u00fcrich beginning in the late 1970s, dealing in works spanning the Impressionist period to contemporary art. Doris headed the gallery until last year, when she died at the age of 76. Hyperallergic has contacted Christie\u2019s and Thomas Ammann Fine Art to request additional details on the Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation. Fortune reports that the foundation has committed to funding children\u2019s health and education causes for the next three to six years and will be funded in part by the sale of the portrait. Georg Frei, chairman of the board of the foundation and partner of the late Doris Ammann, said in a statement that the painting \u201cisolates the person and the star: Marilyn the woman is gone; the terrible circumstances of her life and death are forgotten.\u201d He compared Monroe\u2019s smile to that of the Mona Lisa, echoing a parallel drawn by Alex Rotter, Christie\u2019s chairman of 20th- and 21st-century art. Calling the work \u201cthe absolute pinnacle of American Pop and the promise of the American Dream,\u201d Rotter indicated that it stands beside Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus,\u201d Da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d and Picasso\u2019s \u201cLes Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d as one of the \u201cgreatest paintings of all time.\u201d The sale in May will also test the current valuation of Warhol\u2019s masterpieces. Last fall, Sotheby\u2019s sold \u201cNine Marilyns,\u201d a nearly seven-foot-tall, black-and-white silkscreen from 1962, for $47.4 million. Sotheby\u2019s also sold Warhol\u2019s most expensive work to date, \u201cSilver Car Crash (Double Disaster)\u201d (1963), which fetched $105.4 million in 2013. According to Bloomberg, works by Warhol have sold privately for over $100 million. \u201cShot Sage Blue Marilyn\u201d is distinguished by the method Warhol used to produce it \u2014 a more detailed and demanding technique that he developed in 1964 and used very sparingly because it was so involved. He abandoned that process after creating a small number of the Marilyn portraits, according to Christie\u2019s press release.  The most recent sale of a work from the Shot Marilyn series occurred in 2007, when hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner Steven Cohen purchased the turquoise one in 2007 for $80 million. The two other canvases in the group belong to publisher Peter Brant \u2014\u00a0who purchased the light blue canvas for a mere $5,000 in 1967 \u2014\u00a0and shipping heir Philip Niarchos \u2014 who bought the red one for $3.6 million in 1994.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t For nearly a year after the initial March 2020 lockdowns across the United States, economic productivity throughout the arts sector came to a standstill, as closures affected employment and revenue for museums, theaters, and art spaces nationwide. COVID-19\u2019s impact on the arts has been undeniable, but new data released last week by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) quantifies the extent of the damage: Between 2019 and 2020, the arts economy shrank at nearly twice the rate of the US economy as a whole.\u00a0 The arts represent a broad and varied sector of local, institutional, and national organizations, and the majority of artists working in the US are either self-employed or independently contracted. The NEA says that arts and cultural production fell by 6.4% when adjusted for inflation, compared to a 3.4% decline in the economy overall. The value added by self-employed artists, writers, and performers fell by 20.6%, and, according to the NEA\u2019s analysis, the unemployment rate across arts and culture industries shot up from 3.7% in 2019 to 10.3% in 2020. The NEA reports that while arts and cultural industries regained some ground during 2021, they have not yet returned to 2019 income and activity levels. Several independently owned arts and cultural spaces that initially closed in 2020 never reopened their doors after suffering irremediable economic losses, and others held on by a thread of support from government subsidies and community aid. With theaters and live performance spaces shuttered for nearly a year, the film and performing arts industries were predictably among the hardest hit. The film industry lost approximately 136,000 workers when COVID-19 halted all production, and while many studios have since resumed in-person work, many safety protocols have persisted.\u00a0 Government arts and cultural contributions remained steady during the pandemic. Despite reduced production, arts and culture managed to add $876.7 billion to the national GDP in 2020, down from $919.7 billion in 2019. The findings also highlight that third quarter performing arts revenue doubled from $834 million in 2020 to $1.7 billion in 2021, yet that amount lags behind the $12.7 billion earned in 2019. \u201cWhile arts and cultural industries and workers nationwide have sustained heavy losses, the sector continues to play an outsized role in the U.S. economy \u2014 as the new data demonstrate,\u201d NEA Chair Dr. Maria Rosario Jackson said in a statement.\u00a0 Jackson points to an interesting trend within the sector: That summer of self-isolation and the onset of remote work catalyzed a mass transition to digital arts programming. Gallery openings and live performances, which were once strictly in-person affairs, could be accessed from the comfort of one\u2019s home, and this proliferation of digital media engagement increased economic value by 14.3% between 2019 and 2020, employing 12,000 salaried workers.  The Arts and Cultural Production Satellite Account (ACPSA) compiled data fact sheets illustrating the value that the arts and culture sector added to local economies across the 50 states in 2020. In New York alone, the arts contributed $126.7 billion, which amounts to 7.3% of the state\u2019s overall economic value, and independent artists supplied approximately $5 million overall. While COVID-19\u2019s toll on the creative economy has been significant, for the NEA, sustained value added is a clear indicator of progress and a reason to advocate for greater support of the creative sector.\u00a0 \u201cThe NEA is committed to participating as a key partner in the recovery of this sector, recognizing not only its economic value, but also the arts\u2019 capacity to transform the lives of individuals and communities in other ways, contributing to health and well-being, and overall resilience,\u201d Jackson added.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t It requires no personal connection to Ukraine to have compassion for the current plight of its citizens. People from across the international spectrum, from politicians to poets, are speaking out and sending aid as Ukrainians experience devastating Russian airstrikes on children\u2019s hospitals, maternity wards, and most recently an art school sheltering some 400 individuals in the port city of Mariupol. At least 2,300 people have died in Mariupol alone, and those still alive are facing shortages of food, water, and electricity as invading forces hold the city under siege. The situation has inspired many artists and cultural institutions to agitate for change and raise funds for war relief. Among them is performance artist Marina Abramovi\u0107, who will restage one of her most famous works in support of a crisis that is both universally and personally upsetting for her. \u201cI really hurt,\u201d Abramovi\u0107 said in an interview with W Magazine. \u201cIt hurts so much because war hurts in general.\u201d But for the Yugoslavian-born artist (now Serbia), whose work draws from strong connections to her Eastern European origins, this conflict strikes close to home. \u201cI have full solidarity with [the Ukrainian people] on this impossible day,\u201d Abramovi\u0107 said in a video statement following the declaration of war by Russia on February 24. \u201cAn attack on Ukraine is an attack on all of us. It\u2019s an attack on humanity and has to be stopped.\u201d In a further demonstration of her support, Abramovi\u0107 has partnered with New York\u2019s Sean Kelly Gallery and Artsy to offer a performance art meet-and-greet \u2026 or at least meet-and-silently-stare. Through March 25, interested parties can bid on one of two opportunities for a limited restaging of Abramovi\u0107\u2019s epic performance The Artist Is Present, which took place over the course of almost three months at the Museum of Modern Art in 2010. An encounter for a single person and a second encounter for two people will be captured by photographer Marco Anelli, who documented almost all of the 1,500 participants in the original performance \u2014 an attendance roster that included celebrities such as Lou Reed and Bj\u00f6rk, and, famously, an emotional reunion with the artist\u2019s ex, Ulay.  All the proceeds of the unconventional fundraiser will go to Direct Relief, which is working with Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Health to provide urgent medical assistance as well as long-term aid to the many lives devastated by the war.  Bidding will likely be lively for such a unique opportunity in service of a greater good. Both the single- and two-person experiences have now met their reserve price, surpassing the $10,000 and $15,000 mark, respectively.  Abramovi\u0107 has not staged a work in New York for seven years, but in October of 2021, the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv unveiled Abramovi\u0107\u2019s \u201cCrystal Wall of Crying,\u201d an interactive \u201cwall of healing\u201d that commemorates the Jews killed in Ukraine\u2019s capital during one of the biggest massacres of the Holocaust. It is poignant that a place where the artist sought to bring healing is suffering a new tragedy, and it makes sense that Abramovi\u0107, who has made a career of transforming pain into redemption, wants to do her part.  Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement. Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t In a vote last week on a draft of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) bill, a regulatory framework for digital assets in the European Union, the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) agreed to leave out a provision that many in the crypto industry have characterized as a \u201cde facto Bitcoin ban.\u201d The proposed provision was part of an effort to enforce minimum environmental sustainability standards for crypto assets \u2014 a key aim of the bill, along with supervision and consumer protection. It would have limited \u201cproof of work\u201d (PoW), an energy-extensive consensus mechanism that employs large amounts of CO2-emitting computational power and is used in popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as in the minting of many non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The parliamentary vote on MiCA and the quashing of the PoW provision coincide with a moment in which cryptocurrency advocates are on the defensive in response to United States and European lawmakers\u2019 warnings that Russian oligarchs may capitalize on cryptocurrency to circumvent sanctions. The decision on the PoW provision, which was defeated with a 30-23 vote with six abstentions, has been described as a major victory for the crypto industry and its advocates, who feared that the MiCA provision would hinder innovation. Three days before the vote, French politician Pierre Person tweeted: \u201cBy banning Bitcoin and Ether, by complicating the use of NFT and DeFi, the European Parliament is mortgaging our monetary and financial sovereignty.\u201d In a Twitter thread on the defeat of the provision, Patrick Hansen, head of strategy at the crypto start-up Unstoppable Finance, described the vote as a \u201cbig relief & political success for the bitcoin & crypto currency in the EU,\u201d adding that \u201cthe crypto community in the EU has clearly become a political force!\u201d BREAKING: The ECON committee of the EU Parliament just voted against the de-facto POW-ban: 32 against, 24 in favor.Big relief & political success for the bitcoin & crypto community in the EU\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaaWill share a breakdown of the vote and what\u2019s next here in this thread. #Bitcoin The ample carbon footprint of PoW consensus mechanisms \u2014  a study by the University of Cambridge put Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption on par with that of a small country \u2014 has come under increasing scrutiny. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, the blockchain on which most NFTs are minted, uses PoW, though it has committed to eventually migrating to an alternative, more energy-efficient consensus mechanism called \u201cproof of stake.\u201d According to calculations by artist Memo Akten, the minting of an NFT currently uses an average of 142 kilowatt-hours\u00a0(kWh) of energy, creating 83 kilograms of CO2; factor in bids, sales, and ownership transfers, and those numbers balloon even further. Atken calculated that the footprint of the average NFT on a marketplace like SuperRare \u201cis equivalent to a EU resident\u2019s total electric power consumption for more than a month, with emissions equivalent to driving for 1000 Km, or flying for 2 hours.\u201d \u201cRight now PoW accounts for similar emissions as all private jet flights,\u201d artist Kyle McDonald, whose work has explored the environmental cost of crypto, told Hyperallergic. \u201cEthereum energy use alone is larger than that of Facebook and Google, combined. And NFTs make up\u00a0around 10-20% of all activity on Ethereum. If PoW NFTs led to an overall emissions reduction for the arts, it would be harder to criticize. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m seeing right now.\u201d McDonald, who pointed out that the policies in MiCA were most pertinent to Bitcoin, added: \u201cIf cryptocurrencies can\u2019t meet \u2018minimum environmental sustainability standards,\u2019 we need to ditch them. And if our representatives can\u2019t protect us from environmental\u00a0destruction, we need to ditch them too. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see more direct action, like\u00a0vandalism of mining facilities. Especially in the US, where miners are regularly re-opening abandoned natural gas wells and coal plants.\u201d Dr. Tina Rivers Ryan, an art historian and curator at Albright-Knox Museum who has written extensively about NFTs, believes that artists and collectors should ask themselves what the potential costs \u2014 environmental and otherwise \u2014 of transacting with a particular blockchain might be, and whether the benefits outweigh them. \u201cFor some, the answer is: no blockchain is worth it. (It\u2019s still entirely possible to sell digital art using just a sales agreement and a credit card.) Others are happy to work with the PoW blockchain Ethereum because of its historical role in the development of NFTs and the wealth that is currently stored in it,\u201d Ryan said in an email to Hyperallergic. \u201cMost digital artists I know fall in the middle, choosing to mint with a PoS blockchain like Tezos, where the average sales are lower, but so is the energy consumption.\u201d Of the removal of the PoW provision, Jess Northend, policy lead of the Science and Innovation Unit at the nonprofit Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, told Hyperallergic that regulators should address crypto\u2019s environmental impact \u201cwithout stifling innovation.\u201d \u201cThe amendment voted down this week would simply have shifted the use of Proof of Work elsewhere and likely had a range of unintended consequences, undermining the EU\u2019s burgeoning crypto market,\u201d Northend said. \u201cPolicy makers should instead support the use of Proof of Stake wherever possible, alongside renewable energy for mining, nudging the market towards less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms.\u201d Further efforts to mitigate crypto\u2019s substantial carbon footprint in Europe is in the cards: A parliamentary majority voted to pursue alternative legislation that would include crypto assets in the EU\u2019s sustainable finance taxonomy, which would make it more difficult for mining companies to get funding but would not be as limiting as the MiCA provision. Speaking of behalf of the Socialists and Democrats, who abstained from the vote, Finnish Member of Parliament Eero Hein\u00e4luoma expressed disappointment over the results of the vote. \u201cIf we don\u2019t curtail this massive carbon footprint by putting crypto-currencies on a more sustainable path, our efforts to combat the climate crisis and boost our energy independence risk being in vain,\u201d he said in a statement.

The show is curated by Dr. Petrina Dacres and opens on Thursday, March 24, 2022, with a reception from 6 to 8pm. Originally from Jamaica, Sharon Norwood migrated to Canada as a child. She creates works that exploit the decorative intentions and joy of mark-making and gesturing, disrupt the White gaze and other passive notions of viewing \u201cthe other,\u201d and question standing narratives and systems that shape how identities are understood. Drawing inspiration from the shape of Black hair, the starting point of Norwood\u2019s work is often a curly line. In her abstract prints and paintings, she intertwines organic lines to act as gestural markings; in her ceramic sculptures and installations, the curly line surfaces in interwoven geometric shapes. Norwood\u2019s formal gestures symbolically reference the Black body and its relationship to politics of labor, beauty, and race. Dr. Petrina Dacres is ISCP\u2019s 2022 Jane Farver Memorial Fund resident. She is an independent curator and founding member of Tide Rising Art Projects, an organization created to support and promote contemporary Caribbean art and film, where she serves as its resident Curator and Education Director. Her work and research focus on Caribbean art, African diaspora art, public sculpture and memorials, and memory studies. Dr. Dacres has organized exhibitions at Clemente Soto V\u00e9lez Cultural & Educational Center, New York; the National Museum Jamaica, Kingston; and National Gallery of Jamaica, Kingston, among others. She is Head of the Art History Department at the Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts in Kingston, Jamaica. Sharon Norwood\u2019s Drawing Room is on view March 24\u2013May 27, 2022, at ISCP (1040 Metropolitan Ave., Brooklyn, New York). Open Hours: By appointment Monday\u2013Friday, 10:30am\u20135:30pm.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t One of my companions burst into tears when looking at Brier Patch, Hugh Hayden\u2019s new installation in Madison Square Park. This wasn\u2019t because of the artwork itself, which she proclaimed \u201ccool and ugly at the same time.\u201d It was because answering my question about what she thought of the work caused her to loosen her grasp on the balloon she was bringing home from a kindergarten classmate\u2019s birthday party.\u00a0 Hayden has fashioned a hundred school desks from cedar logs salvaged from the New Jersey Pine Barrens and installed them in four groups spread across the park\u2019s lawns. Spiny branches emerge from their seats and desktops, splaying off in all directions. I wanted to ask my children what they thought about the work because Hayden has explained that Brier Patch comments on education.\u00a0 The title refers to folktales about a wily rabbit who begs the fox who has captured him not to throw him into a nearby patch of thorny brambles. (In America, the folktales were most famously reincarnated in the \u201cUncle Remus\u201d stories about Br\u2019er Rabbit.) The angry fox, wishing to torment his victim, hurls him into the thorns \u2026 only for the rabbit to escape, since he knows how to navigate the seemingly impenetrable pathways through the patch. As my daughter sobbed, my seven-year-old son delivered his opinion. He couldn\u2019t tell whether the work was ugly or beautiful, happy or sad. He would only say that it made him feel confused. Frustrated, I gave up on our cultural outing and delivered on the milkshakes I had promised from the in-park Shake Shack.\u00a0 Back home, reading Hayden\u2019s interview with the New York Times, I realized my son was not so obtuse after all. Hayden said that Brier Patch\u2019s branches could symbolize the barriers to education often present in the United States. On the other hand, he claims that the work can also symbolize that same system\u2019s benefits. No one could sit on these seats, but they might imagine themselves finding a creative perch on the branches, sheltering within the system. The work can be seen as a critique or a celebration \u2014 or both \u2014 depending on the visitor\u2019s frame of reference. Confusing, indeed. Or perhaps a better word might be evasive \u2014 Hayden escapes being pinned down by an interpretation just as surely as Br\u2019er Rabbit escaped Br\u2019er Fox. The one thing Brier Patch is not is a brier patch. The work originated as an installation of six desks at White Columns in 2018. There, the desks were pushed close enough together that their branches intertwined, creating a thicket in the gallery. But the desks in the park sit in widely spaced aisles. The tips of their branches brush up against each other overhead, like enclosed bowers arching over walks in a genteel garden. Nothing would prevent you from moving easily between the desks. One of the four groups of desks is branch-free. In the middle of the dense text on the park\u2019s signage about the piece, a sentence notes that Hayden \u201coffers\u201d these desks to \u201cindividuals and groups to interact with the piece for contemplation or convening.\u201d I haven\u2019t yet seen anyone take up this offer, perhaps because these desks are surrounded by a fence \u2014 a low one, to be sure, but still a barrier. The soft, bright cedar desktops, ripe for doodling or carving, or even staining with Shake Shack ketchup, remain unscathed, more than a month into the installation\u2019s January to May run. The Madison Square Park Conservancy, the nonprofit that manages the park through a public-private partnership, takes similar care of the space\u2019s other features. Its Shake Shack, the chain\u2019s founding location and a crucial partner in the park\u2019s finances, bustles tidily. Parents, whether of dogs or children, have nothing to complain about in the park\u2019s runs and playground. Even pollinators are provided for, with five bee homes scattered amid the greenery. Meanwhile, unhoused people, at-risk youth, protestors, and hustlers have somehow been encouraged to stay six blocks south, in Union Square Park. The Madison Square Park Conservancy has been commissioning temporary art installations for the park since 2004. The signs for Brier Patch describe \u201cthe diverse range\u201d of the program\u2019s artists, while informing us that the work draws from Hayden\u2019s \u201cexperience as an American and African American.\u201d Within the well-patrolled boundaries of the park, where you are never far from a delicately worded fundraising appeal, it\u2019s hard not to see Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.\u00a0 Many of Hayden\u2019s other works, which also make surreal modifications to everyday objects, have much more bite. His American Hero series, which began in 2010 with a taxidermized buffalo mount given cornrows, points out the concealment of Black contributions to foundational American history. A sculpture of a police car draped in a white sheet, 2021\u2019s \u201cBoogey Man,\u201d denounces the white supremacist ideals that underlie police brutality. And Hayden has taken meaningful steps to help others enter the brier patch of the art world, for example by donating works to raise funds for tuition for Black MFA and art history students and persuading the Public Art Fund to expand what had been a solo commission into a group show for other young artists of color. But in the wealthy bubble of Madison Square Park, Brier Patch allows viewers to pat themselves on the back for their mere awareness of inequalities in our educational systems. The parents walking past who send their children to private schools are not made to question their decisions. The nannies whose own children are in sub-par public schools are not encouraged to protest that inequality. Everyone just gets to take nice Instagram photos, since the work does indeed, as my daughter said, look cool.\u00a0 Brier Patch is a temporary outdoor installation, not a public monument, and so I won\u2019t judge it as one. But, as we debate what kinds of new monuments should be built to symbolize our changing understanding of our country, it can serve as a reminder to ask about who is paying. If a monument is seen as an amenity, it is likely to turn into something pleasing to the most influential and deep-pocketed members of a community, regardless of an artist\u2019s intent.\u00a0 Hugh Hayden: Brier Patch continues at Madison Square Park (Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue between 23rd Street and 26th Street, Flatiron and NoMad, Manhattan) through May 1. The project was organized by Brooke Kamin Rapaport, Deputy Director and Martin Friedman Chief Curator; Tom Reidy, Deputy Director, Finance and Special Projects; and Truth Murray Cole, Curatorial Manager. Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t I was recently listening to an Anne Carson lecture on corners. Given at CUNY in 2018, the poet-classicist\u2019s talk floatily triangulated between the introduction of a third actor in Sophoclean plays (corners move narrative forward), her father\u2019s inability to orient himself amid mounting dementia (corners help us locate ourselves), and the corner as a form beyond the dialectic of inside and outside, or shelter and threat (corners are spatially distinct and psychologically freighted). I was drawn to the idea of moving the corner to the center, of recasting a space typically viewed as dustily incidental as a fulcrum of action. The gravity that Carson ascribes to corners sprang to mind when I encountered \u201cCorner Basher\u201d (1988), the first work \u2014 before the check-in desk, even \u2014 in Los Angeles-based sculptor Liz Larner\u2019s most significant survey in more than 20 years, Liz Larner: Don\u2019t put it back like it was at SculptureCenter. Among the earliest of the 28 artworks on view, which span from 1987 to 2021, \u201cCorner Basher\u201d activates a space that is normally invisible. The kinetic sculpture, which resembles a treacherous tetherball set, features a steel pole with a dangling metal ball hooked up to an electric motor. By flipping a switch and rotating a dial on an adjacent column, visitors to the space \u2014 with varying degrees of aggression, glee, and bemusement \u2014 can set the piece in motion, causing it to repeatedly wallop the walls of the corner in which it stands, at a range of velocities. As more people operate the machine over the course of time, the wall increasingly, incrementally, and a bit bathetically, crumbles into pieces on the floor. Conceived as a sly rejoinder to the macho-coded destructive robots of Mark Pauline\u2019s performance collective Survival Research Laboratories, Larner\u2019s collaborative \u201cCorner Basher\u201d literally lays the museum\u2019s structure bare in a work of participatory institutional critique. In the nearby \u201cWrapped Corner\u201d (1991), gleaming chains, turnbuckles, and brackets are kinkily pulled tight around the corner edge of a room in horizontal rows; \u201cToo the Wall\u201d (1990) features six delicately jointed steel and silver armatures, each holding a pale square of leather, suspended across a corner in increasingly taut tiers. These site-responsive drawings in space highlight the physical and social context in which the art and the viewer are situated, and, particularly by centering the anti-heroic corner, pose questions about the values that are reflected in both our built environments and the ways in which we move through those environments (or, show art in them). The feminist thrust of this undertaking is made overt in \u201cBird in Space\u201d (1989): a reinterpretation of the (white, male) Romanian modernist Constantin Brancusi\u2019s famous 1923 sculpture of a bird in flight, a pedestal-mounted phallic abstraction made from marble or bronze. Larner\u2019s own abstract avian, its outstretched wings the size of the room, is constructed from bowed lengths of humble nylon cord held tensile between steel blocks. Slipping in and out of visibility based on the viewer\u2019s position, this sweeping anti-monument asks gallery-goers to recognize where they stand and what they notice: to engage in the relatively unpolished and unsexy, intermittently rewarding, ongoing project of parsing the artworks\u2019 nuances and thinking relationally. \u201cI like to think of the viewer as more of a sensor, a being using every sense to understand an object,\u201d said Larner in an interview with Mary Ceruti for the exhibition catalogue. Larner\u2019s varied work allows us to feel our way toward meaning, often physically moving in the process. It can be difficult to identify, as the artist put it in a recent interview with Jeffrey Kastner, a traditional \u201cthroughline\u201d in her oeuvre (despite the art historical record\u2019s repeated attempts to shoehorn her into post-minimalism). The pieces in the show are wildly disparate, ranging from abstract to figurative and from microscopic to massive, executed in media as diverse as false eyelashes, bronze, porcelain, leather, and steel. They reflect a body of work with a slippery habit of shapeshifting, characterized by a commitment to an active viewing experience and materiality itself, rather than any one material or aesthetic. Larner, who graduated from CalArts with a BFA in photography in 1985, found her way to sculpture organically, via bacterial cultures that she had been cultivating with nutrient agar in petri dishes. Though she initially produced these experiments to photograph them, the artist became interested in letting them unfold as process works in three-dimensional space, giving rise to the cleverly titled Cultures series (1987-ongoing). In \u201cOrchid, Buttermilk, Penny\u201d (1987), the titular items decompose \u2014 altering one another\u2019s chemical compositions in the process \u2014 in two petri dishes encased in glass atop a pedestal. \u201cPrimary, Secondary: Culture of Empire State Building and Twin Towers\u201d (1988), a landscape to the former still life, is an architectonic glass-and-aluminum display of two petri dishes with colorful, crispy material grown from cultures taken at those corporate, seemingly inorganic locations. Exploring representation on a literal, material level, these works set biochemical assemblages into motion, evincing Larner\u2019s early interest in sympoesis and an exploratory, collaborative approach to making that is also at the heart of \u201cCorner Basher.\u201d Encountering the solitary \u201csmile (after dark)\u201d (2009), a somewhat ominous, inky length of shiny porcelain upturned at the corners, conjures up Alice\u2019s wonderment: \u201cI\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u201d From 1996 to 2011, Larner labored on the smile series, a group of abstracted, disembodied grins made from casting foamcore forms in porcelain, a material also used in dental veneers. \u201csmile (after dark)\u201d is hollow, literally. Its unevenly faceted, intermittently lacerated surface makes it difficult to discern the inside from the outside (like a corner), prompting the viewer to scrutinize a detached gesture that is seen as shorthand for joy but so often contains grimacing gradations of ambivalence, obligation, resentment, or anger \u2014 perhaps particularly among people repeatedly told to smile. Larner, who lives and works in the birthplace of the anti-utilitarian California Clay Revolution, has since turned to the softer, more porous medium of ceramics, her focus throughout the past decade. Like the Cultures, ceramics inherently require the artist to cede a measure of authorship to nature and entropy: after the clay, teeming with microorganisms, is dug from the earth, worked, and shaped, it hardens into being in the kiln \u2014 cracking and warping as it sees fit \u2014 outside of the artist\u2019s sight and out of her hands. A sequence of large, wall-mounted ceramic lozenges, begun in 2013, line a lower-level hallway. Glazed or painted in arresting hues and titled after geological phenomena, they include \u201csubduction\u201d (2013), a deep, shifting well of indigo; \u201cinflexion\u201d (2013), a blue morpho butterfly\u2019s shimmering azure; and \u201cvi (calefaction)\u201d (2015), a navy ombre studded with chunky stones and minerals to a celestial effect. Alluding to the fault lines that run through fired clay and earth alike, each thick slab is intractably cracked, from hairline fissures and crumbling edges to clean rips down the middle, visual pauses that riff on Barnett Newman\u2019s zip paintings. The viewer slips, unsettled, between art historical time and geological time; micro and macro; chance and intention; nature and culture.  Through a longstanding practice of regarding her materials and audience as her co-creators, and approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment rather than a static or foreclosed object, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work. The inner unsteadiness \u2014 the searching \u2014 that this push-and-pull sets in motion is the main event. Liz Larner: Don\u2019t put it back like it was continues at SculptureCenter (44-19 Purves St, Long Island City, Queens) through March 28 and will travel to the Walker Art Center (725 Vineland Place, Minneapolis, Minnesota) from April 30 to September 4.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t SANTA FE, NM \u2014 The art world underwent something of a reckoning in 2017 when The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York decided to display Native American works in its American Wing for the first time. \u201cIt was a spark,\u201d says veteran art show producer Kim Martindale about Art of Native America: The Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, an exhibition that premiered in 2018. \u201cIt forced The Met to say, \u2018No, it\u2019s part of American art.\u2019 It\u2019s the first American art and therefore other museums really need it in their collections rather than shoving it to the side and into the tribal ethnographic portion.\u201d Martindale \u2014 channeling this renewed and overdue attention toward Indigenous art \u2014 is producer and director of Art Indigenous Santa Fe. The inaugural contemporary art fair, scheduled to take place this summer during the centennial Southwestern Association for Indian Arts\u2019s Santa Fe Indian Market, has been billed as the first of its kind in the world, where contemporary Indigenous fine art galleries will gather for four days in New Mexico\u2019s capital city. Martindale hopes to expand the Art Indigenous concept \u2014 which will feature sculpture, painting, photography, installation, and performance \u2014 to other cities. Martindale, who says that he produced the LA Art Show for a quarter-century, is a longtime worldwide art fair attendee. For years, the lack of global representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists nagged at him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a show for contemporary artists from Indigenous lineage, and why don\u2019t we see more of that art at some of these major shows?\u201d Along with The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s inclusion of Native American art, Martindale says another milestone took place when the Upper East Side institution hired Patricia Marroquin Norby (Pur\u00e9pecha) as its first full-time curator of Native American art. \u201cOne thing led to another and now there\u2019s a dialog in art museums saying that if you want to have a complete collection of American art, then you need Native American and Indigenous art in the US and Canada in your collection,\u201d says Martindale. \u201cI think this is all gelling together at this moment in time.\u201d The idea for Art Indigenous Santa Fe took off due to the upcoming centennial anniversary of the Santa Fe Indian Market, which is scheduled to take place in an in-person format. The popular event, said to be North America\u2019s largest and most important juried Indigenous art market, is helmed by Native American woman Kim Peone (Colville Confederated Tribes and Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians). The market, which has drawn upwards of 150,000 visitors to New Mexico\u2019s capital city, features Native artists displaying and selling their works in and around the historic Santa Fe Plaza. Martindale was also encouraged to move forward after attending 2021 Art Basel Miami Beach in Florida. There, for the first time, he noticed that an installation and performance piece section of the fair included a Native American artist. \u201cI thought, \u2018Yes. Finally. It\u2019s happening,\u2019\u201d he says. A partial list of participating Art Indigenous Santa Fe galleries is expected to be announced in April 2022; Martindale says the full roster, which he anticipates will be in the range of 30 to 40 galleries, will drop in May. An Art Indigenous Santa Fe preview event is scheduled from 6 to 10 pm on Thursday, August 18 at El Museo de Cultural de Santa Fe at the Railyard Arts District, and the show will run through Sunday, August 21. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking away anything from Indian Market, but rather adding to Indian Market, and bringing in a whole other group of collectors that maybe wouldn\u2019t come to town for Indian Market,\u201d says Martindale. \u201cWith this gallery-oriented show, we\u2019re presenting these artists that have not participated in Indian Market for years or never have.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

Two Athens residency fellowships will be available \u2014 one for a visual art fellow and the other for a curatorial fellow \u2014\u00a0and they will fully fund residents as they live and work in Athens for a duration of two months. Unlike previous years, when fellows were chosen by nomination, applicants from all countries are now welcome to apply, as long as they reside outside of Greece. The residency begins on September 19, 2022 and lasts until November 14. A total fellowship award of $2,000 will be granted to the two chosen fellows, along with a $150 weekly stipend and round trip airfare. The \u201clive-work facilities\u201d on offer include a \u201cgorgeous neoclassical facility\u201d operated by ARCAthens\u2019 partner and contemporary arts organization ATOPOS; each fellow will be accommodated with a private bedroom, private studio, and shared kitchen, bathroom, dining room, and library. Past ARCAthens fellows include artists Tomashi Jackson and Cullen Washington, Jr., and curators Miranda Lash and Larry Ossei-Mensah.\u00a0 If accepted, fellows will be expected to participate in a seminar with students at the Athens School of Fine Arts and a public end-of-year residency event.  \u201cAthens is known for its ancient history, its radiant light, its delightful weather, gorgeous landscape, warm people, rich culture, and delicious food,\u201d says ARCAthens Executive Director Aristides Logothetis in a statement. \u201cAthens, which is also known as a destination for all things modern, is now becoming a vibrant hub of contemporary culture, providing our fellows with an additional lens from which to understand our world today.\u201d  ARCAthens also hosts a virtual residency, which began during the pandemic, in which a curator selects two artists \u2014 one from Greece and one from the Bronx, New York \u2014 to collaborate and exchange ideas through social media.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t Documents published last week by Culture Unstained show the British Museum is exploring extending its extremely unpopular partnership with BP. It seems that a decade of protest, and the example of several other museums cutting ties with the company, hasn\u2019t changed anything \u2014 the museum is still performing gratitude to the oil giant for its generosity. There are so many things about the British Museum to criticize, but its complicity in BP\u2019s artwashing ranks alongside the museum\u2019s continual refusal to engage with its own colonial history and its total rejection of any requests for the repatriation of looted objects held in its collection. It\u2019s these issues, and the connections between them, that are most significant \u2014 two high-profile movements that challenge the way we engage with the British Museum and have consequences that can be felt beyond its walls. There is, broadly, a disconnect between these movements. There are plenty of organizers who move between both spaces, but the public coverage and popular response tends to separate them. Talking about BP leads to the allegation that you\u2019re ignoring the colonialist violence of the museum itself, while focusing on restitution is read as though you\u2019re not thinking about the environmental impact of oil companies. Even as anti-colonial consciousness grows and there is a greater public awareness and involvement in campaigns for restitution, there\u2019s a tendency to not see the modernity of this fight. It\u2019s still bleakly common, even among people who are engaged with these conversations, to see the act of colonialism as an element of the past, and its consequences in the present, but not to consider the ways that colonial exploitation is still active. The language used by museums, the way imperialism is neatly sectioned off into history, the way institutions work to perpetuate the myth that these communities have simply faded passively away, the euphemisms around acquisitions, add to the impression that the actual moment of violence is over. We\u2019re talking about the systematic displacement of communities from their homes, the destruction of cultural landscapes in the pursuit of profit, and the abuse of marginalized laborers to produce wealth in the cultural West. How can this be anything other than a continuation of colonialism? There is an incredible opportunity here for collaborations that can lead to real and meaningful change. In my own experience, it works both ways: People involved in climate justice campaigns are open to learning about the exclusionary history of these spaces, just as those who explore the racism and violence at a museum\u2019s heart are able to consider modern forms of injustice and inequality.\u00a0 The trick, if you like, of museums is to collapse time, to shrink history and geography until we can see all things at once. This same compression can be an opportunity. The flattened structure of a museum works to create comparisons, and we can use those in building solidarity. The best tool at our disposal is context: showing the repetitions of history and exploring the parallels between the imperialist exploitation of people and extraction of resources and wealth, and the neo-colonial violence with which corporations carelessly destroy our environment in pursuit of profit. So how do we pull these threads together? Climate crisis disproportionately affects those who are already marginalized racially and economically, and it is crucial to keep in mind how that marginalization was created in the first place. The organization BP or Not BP has consistently worked to highlight the essentially neo-colonial nature of oil companies, and platform the voices of campaigners for restitution with their \u201cStolen Goods\u201d tours, and interventions that contrast the BP-funded Stonehenge exhibition at the British Museum with the damage done by BP drilling into the petroglyphs at Murujuga on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia. The Stop Adani movement in Australia has also walked this line effectively so far. The Adani coal mines would devastate Wangan and Jagalingou lands, and displace communities in Godda to build power stations \u2014 an environmental issue that keeps the people most directly harmed at its center. And Members of the Indigenous communities impacted by these mines have led the campaign against Adani\u2019s controversial sponsorship of the Science Museum\u2019s \u201cGreen Energy Gallery,\u201d emphasizing that this is cultural as well as environmental destruction. For historians and educators, there\u2019s also a responsibility to address the deeper history of artwashing. The wealthy individuals who influenced the British Museum\u2019s collections and curatorial narratives in the 19th century have their parallels in the sketchy Chairman\u2019s Advisory Group, a group of anonymous representatives from massive corporations who have an unofficial role in steering the museum\u2019s decisions today. Museums under capitalism can\u2019t be completely divorced from these financial influences, but they can at least be transparent about them, and they have to expect that they\u2019ll face scrutiny for them. Pulling these threads together is crucial. A change in sponsorship without the restitution of stolen objects would be inadequate, just as engaging in anticolonial work without considering modern forms of destruction and marginalization is meaningless. We need both, together. The museum is not a space of equality \u2014 it\u2019s governed by uneven power and shaped by privilege, not a reflection of the world around it; nor is it an institution that consistently serves the public. This inequality is obvious to anyone kept away from their own cultural heritage by its cabinets. For those who don\u2019t personally experience the museum\u2019s inequality, or don\u2019t see it as immediately affecting them, being able to point to these concrete examples of deception and complicity can help us bridge the gap. The energy and creativity of climate justice protests combined with the rigor and determination of anticolonial movements is formidable. With solidarity and effort, it could be transformative.

So are we.",
        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t War is raging, oceans are burning, and the breaking news you\u2019ve been waiting for is finally here: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute Benefit (better known as The Met Gala) will return to its traditional spot on the first Monday of May, and this year\u2019s chairpeople and theme have been announced! If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the Met Gala, it\u2019s an annual event that raises funding for the museum\u2019s Costume Institute by encouraging the rich and famous to wear outrageous, themed costumes in a world-class menagerie of peacocking. We\u2019re talking single-use fashion but make at six figures. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cIn America: An Anthology of Fashion,\u201d which follows last year\u2019s \u201cIn America: A Lexicon of Fashion\u201d as a two-part series that focuses on the storied history of American fashion. That\u2019s despite the fact that the United States has been around for less than 250 years, and spent much of that time importing fashion from France and England. Queen of meatpacking pic.twitter.com/5I0r600RA9 But perhaps the Met Gala felt the need to simplify things a little bit after the gala\u2019s 2019 theme \u201cWhat is Camp?\u201d was met with a resounding sense that no one was really sure what it meant. But even the \u201cIn America\u201d theme leaves plenty of room for controversy. Who can forget Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s dress from last year, emblazoned with \u201cTAX THE RICH\u201d and dripping with irony? According to reporting by the New York Times, designers and corporate sponsors generally cover the event\u2019s $35,000 a ticket (or $200,000 to $300,000 for a table) for the gala\u2019s guests, while NYC elected officials are special guests of the museum and do not pay to attend. \u201cIn America: An Anthology of Fashion traces the emergence of a distinct American style, revealing underlying stories that often go unrecognized,\u201d said Max Hollein, the Met\u2019s director, in a statement. \u201cAs a whole, this ambitious two-part exhibition ignites timely conversations about the tremendous cultural contributions of designers working in the United States and the very definition of an American aesthetic.\u201d The evening\u2019s official co-chairs are Hollywood stars Regina King, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. They will host an evening that features the second installment of the exhibition series, displaying approximately 100 fashion items dating from the 19th to the mid-to-late 20th-century. The garments will be presented throughout the Met\u2019s American Wing period rooms, placing them in the context of more than a century of American domestic life, in an attempt to frame an \u201cidentifiable American style.\u201d I\u2019m imagining blue jeans. The exhibition will also be punctuated by eight fictional cinematic vignettes, or \u201cfreeze frames,\u201d within each room, created by filmmakers Janicza Bravo, Sofia Coppola, Julie Dash, Tom Ford, Martin Scorsese, Autumn de Wilde, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, and King. Drawing a connection between fashion and Hollywood certainly underscores the incredible impact of movie-making on fashion as a cultural beacon. Those with a hankering for fashion and celebrity will surely be tuning in to see all the hottest \u201clewks\u201d being served up by the glitterati. Our eyes will especially be peeled for statement pieces in which famous people try to make the current state of world crisis somehow all about them. It will be a season to remember!

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy Kateryna Chuhuieva has urged journalists and activists against disseminating information about efforts to protect cultural heritage properties in the country out of fear of exposing them as targets for Russian troops and opportunists.     \u201cWe ask journalists and activists not to share information about current protection measures, imposed by museums and local residents, the location of these goods, and the places for their relocation during the war,\u201d Chuhuieva said during a briefing on Thursday, March 17. \u201cPublication or sending such data to unknown individuals and unchecked organizations might endanger people as well as museum exhibits.\u201d Objects of immense cultural significance \u201ccan become attractive targets for both the enemy and looters and thieves,\u201d the deputy minister explained. She also said that Ukrainian officials were working with UNESCO to distinguish cultural heritage sites with the Blue Shield emblem to afford them with enhanced protection status. If such sites are granted this status, their destruction would constitute evidence of a war crime.  Attacks in Ukraine have already decimated several churches, and many Ukrainians are scrambling to evacuate treasured artifacts that are at high risk of destruction in future strikes. Earlier this week, on March 16, a theater in the eastern port city of Mariupol that sheltered at least 1,000 civilians was bombed by Russian forces; it remains unclear how many were killed in the attack. A museum in the town of Ivankiv near Kyiv, housing a number of works by the artist Maria Pryimachenko, was bombed on February 28. Many Ukrainians see such callous neglect of its heritage as part and parcel of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s nationalistic campaign to deny Ukraine of its cultural specificity, and hence sovereignty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky has contended that the Kremlin is intent on the \u201cerasure\u201d of Ukraine\u00a0as an independent sovereign state. With the prospect of a coordinated assault on Ukrainian cultural treasures on the horizon, civilian documentation of the destruction of cultural heritage is encouraged. Despite its cautionary statement on broadcasting information on efforts to salvage Ukrainian heritage properties, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy recently rolled out a website where those who have witnessed cultural crimes across Ukraine are asked to submit photo and video evidence. Lazare Eloundou, head of Unesco\u2019s World Heritage Centre, reported that the agency was increasingly receiving reports about the destruction of cultural heritage in several cities, and that its officials were working closely with local cultural professionals to develop an \u201caction plan.\u201d  Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t In April last year, a fire at the College City campus of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro set the second floor of a modernist building ablaze. That building, designed by Jorge Machado Moreira, housed the University of Architecture and Urbanism, whose Research and Documentation Center \u2014 or N\u00facleo de Pesquisa e Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o (NPD)  \u2014 contained archival equipment like cameras, scanners, and computers. It also held over 50,000 documents and 5,000 photographs recording more than 150 years of Brazilian architectural history. The papers included those associated with Brazilian modernist architects such as L\u00facio Costa, Affonso Eduardo Reidy, Roberto Burle Marx, and Moreira himself, as well as Europeans like Le Corbusier. Earlier this month, the Getty Foundation granted $240,000 to the NPD to restore the archives damaged by the fire, which started in an air-conditioning unit. Founded in 1982, the NPD was established with the purpose of collecting documents important to the architectural history of Brazil. \u201cThese collections are considered the most important architectural archives of modern Brazil\u2019s Carioca School, so the conservation and long-term care of these priceless items is our highest priority,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00edn Passaro, an NPD coordinator, said in a statement. The Escola Carioca, a group of architects active from 1930 to 1960, drew inspiration from modernists like Le Corbusier while hybridizing that style with Luso-Brazilian elements.\u00a0 For 18 months, a team of conservators and an archivist will work with students in the Conservation and Restoration department at the Escola de Belas Artes and the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism to restore the collections. This will involve preventative measures like situating them in a new temperature-stabilized environment, while assessing the condition of what remains and keeping up-to-date records on a database. Students and staff will also be trained in best practices for the conservation of the roughly 38,500 objects that survive. \u201cWhile soot and water permanently harmed a significant number of items and the Center is now unusable, we can take comfort in knowing the bulk of our collection will be given a new home with suitable environmental conditions,\u201d Passaro continued. In recent years, preventable blazes at Brazil\u2019s museums and cultural institutions have occurred with upsetting regularity. In 2018, a fire at Brazil\u2019s National Museum eviscerated 90% of its collection, destroying one of the largest museums of natural history and anthropology in the Americas overnight. Among the many artifacts damaged were \u201cLuzia,\u201d the oldest human fossil in the Americas, and the most extensive Egyptian collection in the Americas. In July 2021, a fire enveloped the Cinemateca Brasileira, Brazil\u2019s foremost archive for film and television \u2014\u00a0an inevitability that many had apprehensively predicted given deep budget cuts and an observable pattern of negligence toward arts and culture under the governing regime. The grant is the latest one in Getty\u2019s Keeping it Modern initiative, which supports conservation efforts for modernist buildings worldwide. The conservation of the site of the NPD is important not only because it represents a significant building preservation in its own right. Its materials are additionally critical to preservation professionals, who \u201crely on collections like these to care for modern buildings,\u201d S\u00e3o Paulo-based preservation architect Silvio Oksman said in the statement. Getty indicated in a press release that it is currently doing conservation work on 77 sites, a majority of which \u201cinvolve the development of conservation management plans that draw heavily on archival materials such as those housed in the Jorge Machado Moreira building.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

Cumbo will succeed Gonzalo Casals, who stepped down at the end of Bill de Blasio\u2019s mayoral term in 2021 and joined the Mellon Foundation as a senior research and policy fellow. Last December, Cumbo voiced opposition to legislation\u00a0that allows nearly one million noncitizens living in New York to vote in municipal elections, arguing that it would \u201cshift the power dynamics\u201d in the city to the disadvantage of its Black residents. \u201cWe do not have the numbers or the information to know how that is going to impact African-American communities who have been the most vulnerable in our existence in our city,\u201d Cumbo told Politico.  \u201cLaurie Cumbo has a recent record of anti-immigrant statements & policy positions.

Cumbo is a longtime and fervent supporter of Adams, who has defended her potential nomination. \u201cLaurie\u2019s a superstar, and I love Laurie,\u201d he told Politico in January.\u00a0 Born and raised in Brooklyn, Cumbo earned an undergraduate degree in Art History from Spelman College and an MA in Visual Arts Administration from New York University. A member of the city council from 2014 to 2021 representing its 35th district \u2060\u2014 which covers several Brooklyn neighborhoods including Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill \u2060\u2014 Cumbo also founded the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts in Fort Greene in 1999.  In 2017, Cumbo successfully sponsored a legislative package that increased funding for the Percent for Art program, a public art initiative administered by the DCLA. At the time, it was the largest package of bills in the history of the agency. She also supported and\u00a0passed legislation\u00a0to\u00a0create\u00a0the\u00a0first-ever citywide Minority\u00a0and\u00a0Women-Owned Businesses Task Force.\u00a0 In a press release shared by DCLA today, several leaders of cultural institutions across the city,  including the Laundromat Project and the Brooklyn Arts Council, praised the former councilwoman and welcomed the appointment. \u201cLaurie Cumbo has been a tireless advocate for arts and culture organizations and, more particularly, organizations led by people of color,\u201d said\u00a0Melody Capote, executive director of the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute. But critics of Cumbo cite her record of culturally insensitive and polarizing statements that appear to pit ethnic groups against one another. In 2013, she apologized for writing in a Facebook post that \u201cthe accomplishments of the Jewish community triggers feelings of resentment\u201d among her constituents. The comment was made in the wake of a series of attacks on Jewish residents of Crown Heights and was interpreted by many as anti-Semitic. In 2015, Cumbo also apologized for expressing concerns over \u201cblocs\u201d of Asian Americans moving into public housing in her district during a council hearing. At the height of Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, Cumbo, who is Black, compared calls to defund the police to \u201ccolonization\u201d and said the movement was led primarily by White progressives. The DCLA is the largest cultural funding agency in the United States, providing hundreds of millions of dollars to more than 1,000 arts and culture nonprofits across all five boroughs of New York City. \u201cI thank Mayor Eric Adams for appointing me to this position. Together, we will center the arts\u00a0in\u00a0New York\u2019s economic recovery and bolster the educational and cultural experiences of every New York City student from Pre-K to CUNY,\u201d Cumbo said in the DCLA\u2019s statement.  Echoing Adams\u2019s tough-on-crime rhetoric, she added: \u201cI also believe we can help address public safety issues in New York City\u00a0\u2014\u00a0taking a gun out of the hands of a young person and replacing it with an instrument, paintbrush, camera, or script will redirect the talent and passions of our youth towards building a better and more vibrant New York City.\u201d\u00a0 Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t LONDON \u2014 William Hogarth is best known for his moralizing satires of British pretension, such as his painting sequences A Rake\u2019s Progress (1732\u201334) or Marriage a la Mode (1743), and for his xenophobic nationalism as exhibited, for example, by grotesque depictions of the French in \u201cThe Gate of Calais\u201d (1843). The press for Tate Britain\u2019s show Hogarth and Europe initially intrigues by promising to look at him in context with his European counterparts for the first time, \u201c[exploring] the parallels and exchanges that crossed borders and the cosmopolitan character of [his] art.\u201d While contemporary Britain is feeling the economic pinch from Brexit turmoil, this statement from curators Alice Insley and Martin Myrone sounds like a canny echo of pro-European Union sentiments. However, a different topical issue emerges as the primary reason for contextualizing Hogarth and Europe \u2014 that of societal inequality, racism, sexism, and colonialism. UK institutions are increasingly looking inward to examine their colonial pasts and links to slavery. Museum officials are rethinking ways to present the visual content of their collections, much of which perpetuates outdated and, at times, condemnable societal attitudes, and commissioning reports to identify where institutions have benefited from colonialism and slavery. In this spirit, we are invited to consider Hogarth\u2019s period of Enlightenment during the 18th century as having ideals \u201cproduced by, and [which] benefited, white men from the middle and upper classes. The concept of European superiority deepened, entrenching ideas about nation, personal identity, and racial difference, manifested in the horrors of transatlantic slavery.\u201d It is unfortunate, then, that a heavy-handed approach to this project, combined with a lack of focus, sorely undermines the curators\u2019 honorable intentions. This is the first exhibition I have seen in which the lead curators write the main wall captions, but an additional group of \u201ccommentators\u201d has been formed to lend \u201cperspective and expertise\u201d in smaller captions. These include various art historians, artists, and conservationists, as well as the Museum Detox Interpretation Group, a body composed of people of color who work in museums and heritage and who seek to champion diversity in the arts. At best, the additional commentary is insightful and provides jumping off points for discussion, or highlights the significance of minor characters who are peripheral in the compositions.  Issues arise, however, when it becomes too speculative \u2014 for instance, imagining the thoughts of marginalized figures in the artworks (often people of color) \u2014 or forces the agenda beyond provability. Next to Hogarth\u2019s \u201cThe Distressed Poet\u201d (1733-35), for example, is a caption by Lars Tharp that homes in on the presence of porcelain and tea imported from Asia (specifically a red teapot that is \u201cprobably Chinese\u201d), all of which are almost impossible to make out in the image itself \u2014 other visitors I noticed also struggled to find these items. This reading ignores the main focus, which is a poet slumped over his latest work in a decrepit bedsit, neglecting his family, and the presence of a milkmaid demanding an unpaid bill, in favor of barely visible tropes of colonialist expansion in tea and porcelain. Other details, such as a cupboard empty save for a mouse, and a dog stealing food from the family\u2019s plate, clearly emphasize the primary satirical focus on the social and romantic pretensions of the aspiring poet at the expense of feeding his family and paying those who serve him. It is actually a curious paradox that because the curators seek to find commonalities between Hogarth and his European contemporaries with the purpose of highlighting societal inequality, as well as exploitation and privilege resulting from slavery across the board, the exhibition might as well not be about Hogarth at all. This is unfortunate, as it is the most comprehensive collection of his art likely to be assembled for years to come; it includes 60 works, among them private loans and pieces from the US, notably the gorgeous portrait of \u201cMiss Mary Edwards\u201d (1742) from the Frick in New York.\u00a0 The last room is filled with many portraits examining a trend toward depicting greater humanity in wealthy sitters, yet the question of inequality is again forced with this opaque explanation: \u201cSometimes, where these images suggest subjectivities rejected or compromised by the dominant ideas about race, class and gender, they hint at the unfulfilled promises and contradictions of modern European society.\u201d A valid point is hovering around in this ambiguous language, but the dense academic prose seems to sidestep direct address of wealth and privilege.\u00a0 Yet what most complicates the attempt to both unify Hogarth and European artists and highlight outdated depictions is the question of satire, and how he used it. Take \u201cSouthwark Fair\u201d (1733), which depicts a fair that was held around Borough High Street every year until its abolition in 1762, and was often a scene of violence and impropriety. It is crammed with innumerable details of cartoonish figures engaged in revelry; on the far right a stage collapses under the weight of actors in a moment of chaos. Among the crowd are figures watching a peepshow, a dwarf playing bagpipes, and, in a clear indication of society gone topsy-turvy, a dog dressed as a gentleman and walking on its hind legs. It is demonstrably a wry condemnation of polite society breaking down with the excuse of a festival. Adjacent to the dog is a Black man playing a trumpet. The curators\u2019 caption posits a deliberate parallel between the dog dressed as a gentleman and the trumpeter, indicating that while \u201cmocking social class\u201d it nonetheless \u201csignals deepening ideas of racial difference pervasive in 18th Century culture.\u201d There is no further comment given to support this reading, so it remains more a suggested interpretation than an overwhelmingly convincing example of outright racism within Hogarth\u2019s work.\u00a0 As the curators have centered inequality in 18th-century European society throughout the survey, satire promises a more productive way into the subject than simply looking out for evidence of colonialist tropes such as tea and porcelain or tobacco, coffee, and sugar \u2014 \u201c[latent] elements of exploitation and subjection\u201d \u2014 in Hogarth\u2019s \u201cA Midnight Modern Conversation\u201d (shown at the Tate in a copy after the lost original). This is not to deny the recognition of such items as evidencing horrific exploitation in their production, but focusing on such items threatens to sideline the potential for a more complex discussion. (Ironically, the attention to satire highlights how distinct Hogarth is from his European contemporaries, whose works on view never achieve his capacity for nuanced satire.) Far from simply recording things as they appeared, Hogarth\u2019s exaggerated compositions and other satirical elements are active commentaries meant to provoke thought. The introductory text says the works shown \u201cexpress a critical view of society, but they also reveal the entrenchment of racist, sexist, and xenophobic stereotypes. Artists may have celebrated individuality, but they also made representations of people that are disturbing or dehumanising.\u201d Within Hogarth it is this tangling of the exaggerated grotesquery of satire and the recording of figures informed by entrenched racist perceptions of the time that problematizes any straightforward interpretation of his images. The section on \u201cA Modern Midnight Conversation\u201d questions whether this image of white men falling about dunk, in various versions with Black slaves in attendance, is a moralizing condemnation of vice and the material mores of a society benefiting from slavery, or actually a gentle and affectionate ribbing of the behaviors of this strata of society, in which Hogarth was trying to ingratiate himself. In this instance we may see Hogarth as complicit in perpetuating colonialist stereotypes of slavery and oppression. If the overarching aim of this show is, as it seems, to uncover and belatedly condemn the racist elements of these artworks, it misses an important point. Yes, much of the art contains unacceptable imagery as it reflects social and racial hierarchies of the time. But why assemble the most significant grouping of Hogarths from far and wide simply to sweep it wholesale into this bucket, without indicating why calling out the faults in historical artworks is important to our understanding of our world today? Or, likewise, discussing the ambiguity of satire, which allows the artist to position himself as an external critic and be complicit in the critiqued acts. This same positional ambiguity enables much ingrained racism and white privilege still. It is a fact that social systems, and thus daily lives, in the UK and abroad are shaped by the horrors of slavery and colonialism, but in seeking out and condemning artifacts from the past the curators of this and similarly themed exhibitions risk historicizing racism. Rather, we should relate it to today\u2019s very real and still entrenched racism and sexism. In short, what can we learn from these artworks if we hold them up as mirrors? It is never a pleasure to address curatorial missteps when an exhibition has at its center a very urgent and honorable desire to condemn outdated racist views and stereotypes. Despite its shortcomings and sometimes muddled delivery, we should nonetheless admire the curators\u2019 effort to reevaluate Hogarth whom, for a long while, has received a free pass under the all-forgiving umbrella of \u201csatire.\u201d One of British art\u2019s most revered eccentric characters should not be exempt from criticism and the curators should be credited for creating a conversation around the issue in the first place. An important takeaway from the show is the encouragement more than ever to consider the societal and historical context in which art is made; in short, not to simply take its message at face value, which is a core principle of investigative art history. Hogarth and Europe continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through March 20. The exhibition was curated by Alice Insley, Curator, British Art c 1730 \u2013 1850, and Martin Myrone, former Senior Curator, pre-1800 British Art, Tate Britain.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t You don\u2019t need to use a lot of colors to be a great colorist. This became obvious when I saw the exhibition Harriet Korman: New Work at Thomas Erben Gallery (February 24\u2013April 9, 2022), her fourth with the gallery. To further define the singularity of Korman\u2019s achievement, in contrast to many other abstract artists of her generation (she was born in the 1940s) who have been in pursuit of color, she does not nod to pop culture in her color choices, nor does she have a signature structure into which she drops her hues. Rather, she works in distinct series without any ostensible subject matter. As a consequence, she has not developed either a signature style or palette, those conventional access points the art world seems to crave. She wants the viewer to have a more direct and open encounter with her work, which is a seldom-traveled road these days.\u00a0 As Korman states in the gallery press release: In this current series, I drew to find a form I wanted to work with. These drawings are not studies, I consider drawing to be an equal practice to painting and value them as such. While drawing, I chose a very simple, familiar form of concentric rectangles because it seemed like it would be an interesting challenge. I took that form into painting without referring to the drawings, and later used the drawings as sources for the paintings. Later, she adds: I try to capture the dynamic in the drawings; the color relationships, the proportions, the movement \u2014 what attracts me in the drawing, not copy it. This interpolation has many obstacles, pitfalls, inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies, but ultimately is very engaging. Korman\u2019s interest in proportion and movement are key to the dynamic relationships that she articulates in the recent paintings. While the paintings share the formal element of concentric rectangles there is nothing formulaic about what she does; each painting comes across as distinct, hard earned, and, at times, it seems almost rudimentary.\u00a0 Many artists who explore color and geometry produce variations on a form or a palette, but this is never the case with Korman. You might think that she would settle into habits but she never does. I cannot stress how fresh and exciting this is. For one thing, each painting comes across as individual and specific, rather than as a variation on a pre-established form or another fill-in-the-colors version of geometric abstraction. By designating each work as \u201cuntitled,\u201d she shortens the distance between the viewer and the art by avoiding any detours through language and its attendant associations. \u00a0 The freshness of these paintings is a result of Korman starting with oil stick drawings, which are meant to stand on their own, and do. In the drawings, she proceeds improvisationally: each color rectangle and the space it takes up determines what happens next. The width of the framing rectangles is markedly different and follows no pattern. The drawings work incrementally, in a process of adding without erasing or covering over one color with another that has its roots in Jackson Pollock and his poured paintings.\u00a0 Each drawing becomes a possible structure to explore. The shift from oil stick drawing to oil painting, as well as the change in scale, evokes the legendary jazz pianist Art Tatum improvising Vincent Youmans\u2019s \u201cTea for Two.\u201d While respecting the original song, he makes it into something all his own. When the drawings and paintings are in close proximity, it becomes apparent how much Korman has transformed one thing into another, always while respecting the nature of her materials, the porous density of the oil stick, and the smooth solidity of the oil paint.\u00a0 At the same time, there are a number of artists working this way \u2014 in which color calls to color \u2014 but I can\u2019t think of anyone as sensitive to the internal dynamics of proportion and density, and of the weight of one color against another, as Korman. These concerns, and her ability to trust her decisions without going back into the work, as if a perfect resolution existed, are why these paintings never become formulaic. Look at the ones on the gallery\u2019s longest wall and you will see that the proportions within the paintings\u2019 rectangles change and she does not work on an equally sized format: she is not programming her work according to consumers\u2019 desire for dependability. In recent years Korman has worked with saturated colors, so her use of browns and chartreuse signal something new in her work. In the case of brown, she uses it as a neutral (neither warm nor cool), causing the other colors to gain in strength, or places two different tones in close proximity.\u00a0 In fact, while I was scrutinizing the paintings, both up close and from a distance, I realized that I kept doing something that I rarely do in an exhibition. I repeatedly stood back and gazed at a group of paintings, seeing what they shared and what distinguished them, and taking particular notice of how the density of the colors changed from work to work. It is so easy to overlook this crucial difference between Korman\u2019s art and that of other artists who, for example, work within a grid structure.\u00a0 Korman\u2019s geometric abstractions make those of other artists seem flabby. With many geometric abstract artists the similarities among their paintings far outweigh the differences. That this never happens with Korman\u2019s paintings should clue you into what is remarkable about them \u2014 for which she should receive more recognition. Each painting possesses a quietly unique identity.\u00a0 When she uses two yellows in a painting, as in \u201cUntitled\u201d (2021, oil on canvas, 48 by 60 inches), they are not the same, but it\u2019s the colors between them, and the width of each separating band, that makes their difference visually momentous. Walter Pater famously said, \u201cAll art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.\u201d Korman\u2019s paintings exist in a musical state; they compose an intuitively orchestrated set of optical vibrations that synthesize contrast and tonal shifts, large and small intervals, by underscoring difference.\u00a0 She brings together different clusters and tones, some sharply contrasting and other tonally shifting. Sometimes the interval between related tones is marked by contrasting colors. And even within the internal configuration Korman will do something unexpected, such as frame the contrasting color with a wide and a very narrow band. The overall effect is that a viewer is continuously pulled into the paintings, and will begin to notice the internal harmonies and dissonances, and how they fit together without becoming subsumed into an overarching pattern.\u00a0 At one point, I limited my focus to the edges of the concentric rectangle, and how some were curved, which made the concentric planes appear as if they were billowing. Then I began accounting for all that was not a concentric rectangle: a floating, diagonal, yellow-orange brushstroke within the deep orange rectangle in the center of the painting, a brown line within the narrow, red, centered lozenge-like rectangle.\u00a0 We are not meant to see Korman\u2019s paintings all at once. The kind of looking her paintings and drawings demand, and should receive, is slow. As we become more attuned to her decisions, we may realize that we cannot ascribe any other motivation than the pursuit of a unique color sensation. It is a harder goal to achieve than one might think, and Korman is one of the few who has never made a signature form, or developed a market-driven aesthetic, within that domain.\u00a0 Harriet Korman: New Work continues at Thomas Erben Gallery (526 West 26th Street, floor 4, Chelsea, Manhattan) through April 9.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t The lesson embedded in Pace Gallery\u2019s How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic, an exhibition of David Byrne\u2019s art, is spelled out in a wall-sized artist statement at its entrance. For visitors who can still catch this breezy, trippy show before it wraps up its six-week-long run this Saturday, figuring out the title\u2019s significance from the works themselves can be more rewarding than relying on the autobiographical explanation. Byrne\u2019s nattily sketched word associations, surreal cartoons, and thought diagrams \u2014 also collected in A History of the World (in Dingbats) Drawings and Writings David Byrne (Phaidon Press 2022) \u2014 nod to art making as high-spirited brainstorming and insightful deviations.\u00a0 The fact that mental detours serve as this show\u2019s unifying theme will be no surprise to any visitor with passing knowledge of Byrne\u2019s multimedia career. Like the drawings and writings at Pace, Byrne\u2019s output has involved creative sleights of hand that only appear effortless due to decades of savvy refinement. From his days as a two-time art college dropout turned frontman and chief songwriter for the punk-era juggernaut the Talking Heads to his current Broadway turn deconstructing the pop concert into postmillennial musical theater through the stripped down, gymnastic choreography of American Utopia, Byrne exploits our country\u2019s homegrown conventions. His subject matter ranges from advertising bromides to self-help talk to religious fundamentalist exhortations, their languages reframed into funkier, more skewed grooves and configurations that \u2014 like these spur-of-the-moment drawings and pictographs \u2014 make America\u2019s delusional optimism seem credible again.\u00a0 Byrne\u2019s public reputation for proposing counterintuitive hopefulness provides another subtext in How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic. Although he enjoys a celebrity\u2019s comfortable perch in gentrified New York, the artist has publicly inveighed, insightfully and determinedly, against the city\u2019s ongoing encrustation in Midas gold. In response, less famous and well-connected fellow artists \u2014 including some in this publication \u2014 have charged him with ignoring creative communities and cultural initiatives thriving beyond Gotham\u2019s gilded zip codes. But living in the glass house of an elite Manhattan gallery, as Byrne does, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t throw rhetorical stones at the creepy commodification of nearly every facet of daily American life, provided you aim those objections at the right agents. That\u2019s not to say this exhibition is political. It isn\u2019t. But there\u2019s more than a winking nod to the inbuilt contradiction in showing unassuming drawings and writings \u2014 most made spontaneously by Byrne with a mere pen or pencil on archival paper \u2014 in an elite art gallery with global outposts. Set directly across from the ostentatious Chelsea skyline visible through the gallery\u2019s 7th-floor skylights and ceiling-to-floor windows, Byrne\u2019s small-scaled and spare drawings \u2014 many dating from the city\u2019s grueling lockdown period in 2020 \u2014 may remind us (and maybe reminded the artist as well) that art can be created wherever you find yourself entombed, and by using whatever tools you have in that bunker. So, is Byrne\u2019s art any good? Stylistically, the best drawings and most interesting verbal pictographs land somewhere between the interrogative visual adventures in Saul Steinberg\u2019s virtuosic drawings and the sometimes overhyped calisthenics of Keith Haring\u2019s charming silhouettes. As the exhibition spotlights the most rudimentary level of Byrne\u2019s visual repertoire, it\u2019s akin to observing, in any given city or small town, a daydreaming bus passenger with pen in hand, drawing or scribbling excitedly in a moleskin notebook. So the \u201cnon-rational logic\u201d to which Byrne alludes is the fertile mindlessness that goes into making art on an everyday basis.\u00a0 And so Byrne shows that the pen has reasons that reason can never know. A still-life doodle of a woolen winter cap can metamorphose hairy human limbs and look ready to take a winter\u2019s walk. A self-assured pigeon gazing into its wardrobe mirror can see its neurotic human double staring back with reciprocal envy or admiration for what they both almost are, or aren\u2019t. Visual engimas like these play out through the drawings\u2019 consistently disarming humor. What causes the agony in Byrne\u2019s Mr. Potato Head as he grimaces and rears backward on skinny avian legs? Is the giant finger reaching down for a pill-sized smart phone that of a postmodern Gulliver, texted by Lilliputians who miss his company?\u00a0 Some of the works that include writing \u2014 especially the wall-sized mural that dominates the exhibition space \u2014 represent Byrne scattering and then rearranging cultural code words and familial or social labels. One drawing shows that a cocktail bar\u2019s taxonomies can be as intellectually productive as a chemist\u2019s periodic table. Other word associations are set within the roots and branches of trees to reveal how pre-given categories can, without much conscious thought, outgrow or uproot former hierarchies; still other pictorial lists show how the subconscious mind classifies and distorts markers of human progress or worldly success.\u00a0 Stop making sense, Byrne famously sings in the Talking Heads\u2019 underground dance hit \u201cGirlfriend Is Better\u201d (1982). And in the American decades since Byrne first plied his musical trade in New York\u2019s squalid Lower East Side clubs \u2014 in a far more egalitarian economy than ours and in a city that then had an undeniably more diverse, de-institutionalized artistic ecosystem \u2014 the willfully ignorant among us have increasingly seized power by denying empirical facts while claiming to be most enlightened, turning rationality ever more on its aching head. \u00a0 So this lightheartedness is a tonic for our times even as the exhibition poses a serious question: Can the simplest gestures in art and writing revive optimism amid the dangerous nonsense and simplifications that pass for cultural and intellectual exchanges these days? In the liner notes to his album American Utopia (2018) Byrne, in the pre-pandemic Trump-era, comes close to eulogizing that American tradition of hope, before returning to the premise that \u201cto be descriptive is to be prescriptive.\u201d If you unpack that sentiment further in light of these drawings and writings, it\u2019s less a na\u00efve platitude than it sounds. And it makes me wonder what else art is for, but to remind us that what we call \u201cbeing reasonable\u201d is too often our expedient alibi for not using our imagination. David Byrne: How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic continues at Pace Gallery (540 West 25th Street, Chelsea, Manhattan) through March 19. The exhibition was organized by the gallery.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t Over the past six decades, Bill Hutson has exhibited his multifaceted artwork nationally and internationally, but has never shown it in his hometown. Hutson grew up in the strictly segregated city of San Marcos, Texas in the 1930s and \u201940s, where art was one of many things that were off limits to non-White citizens. \u201cI was born and raised in an environment where there were no incentives that would lead me to visual [or] fine arts,\u201d Hutson told Hyperallergic in a recent email. \u201cIf there was a gallery, museum or visual art venue,\u201d he explained, \u201cI would not have had access to it as non-white people in that town at that time could not have gone to such places without going there to either clean the bathroom, wash the windows or mop the floor.\u201d\u00a0 The Art of Bill Hutson in San Marcos is a long overdue, city-wide tribute to the artist\u2019s innovative work, and his will to overcome challenges despite great odds. Curated and organized by Margo Handwerker, the Chief Curator and Director of the Texas State Galleries at Texas State University, and Linda Kelsey-Jones, the university\u2019s Community Arts Coordinator, Hutson\u2019s first exhibition in Texas presents more than 60 works across five venues, including The Calaboose African American History Museum, The Price Center, The San Marcos Art Center, Texas State Galleries, and Walkers\u2019 Gallery at the San Marcos Public Library. The exhibition offers viewers a rare chance to survey Hutson\u2019s prolific and varied output. It\u2019s also a frank and sincere gesture towards reconsidering the city\u2019s relationship to its own history with regards to race. Hutson was born in San Marcos in 1936. His father died when the artist was only five, so he and his siblings took on agricultural and construction jobs in addition to their school work to help out. The young Hutson found visual inspiration nearby. \u201cI was attracted to cartoons as our house, a shotgun house, had wallpaper that was actually newspaper,\u201d Hutson said by email. \u201cIn this way all during my childhood I saw cartoons and sometimes I would draw and copy them.\u201d Hutson saw his first painting on the campus of Texas State University, where he helped his mother at her job as a custodial worker. Still, Huston told Hyperallergic, \u201cI was nearly an adult before I became aware of fine art.\u201d The turn to artmaking came after Hutson had finished high school and served in the US Air Force. He moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s, where he attended an art school and worked as a studio assistant to the artist Frank N. Ashley. In 1963, Hutson moved to New York City, where he joined the vibrant art scenes of SoHo and Midtown Manhattan. Over the next 40 years, the artist lived and exhibited between the US, Europe, and Africa. Hutson now lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where his art and archives are housed in the permanent collection of the Phillips Museum at Franklin & Marshall College. The cornerstone piece of the city-wide presentation is \u201cHomestead with signs, symbols and numbers\u201d (1979-1990), a roughly seven- by nine-foot canvas at Texas State Galleries. Crucially, Handwerker has included two preparatory sketches for the work, as well as the artist\u2019s model of his childhood home. Each of these elements helps the viewer to decode Hutson\u2019s complex constellation of signs that stand for the racial topography of the San Marcos of his youth, where African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans were prohibited from visiting downtown, using most public facilities, and frequently threatened with violence. In one drawing, for example, we see Hutson exploring themes of ownership, belonging, and space as he writes the names of local indigenous populations who have inhabited the region for centuries. He later references these groups in an abstracted painted teepee. The work is also technically layered. Hutson\u2019s thick, swirling passages of acrylic paint are carefully bound by sharp, angular edges. His shapes float over a textured green background treated with the artist\u2019s \u201cbind-stain-release-flatten\u201d technique, in which the canvas is condensed, dyed, and then stretched onto a frame. The method appears in several of Hutson\u2019s other pieces, along with sewing, 3D elements, and other interventions that alter the very fabric and structure of the work itself. Here Hutson seems to be challenging painting as a surface and concept. Other works are made up of moveable, modular components that can be configured freely. Ultimately, the piece embodies what Hutson calls the \u201ctragic paradox of \u2018home,\u201d where a point of origin is also a place of, in the artist\u2019s words, \u201coppression, bondage and insecurity.\u201d This complicated ambivalence makes this homecoming all the more important. Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t This kind of cluttered onslaught of homogenous e-commerce options is what recently prompted Dmitri Brereton, a twenty-six-year-old engineer at a recruiting-software company in San Francisco, to publish a blog post titled \u201cGoogle Search Is Dying.\u201d When it comes to product reviews or recipes, Brereton argued, results from Google\u2019s search engine \u201chave gone to shit.\u201d Rather than settling for the default, those who want to know what a \u201cgenuine real-life human being\u201d thinks of a certain product have learned work-arounds, such as adding \u201cReddit\u201d to their searches to bring up relevant threads on that platform. On Reddit\u2019s \u201cBuy It for Life\u201d forum, for instance, they\u2019ll find users showing off a Soviet-era toaster, a restored vintage Sunbeam, and other toasters to \u201cgrow old with,\u201d as one put it. Brereton\u2019s post\u2013which ended \u201cGoogle is dead. Long live Google + \u2018site:reddit.com\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014became the No. 10 most upvoted link ever on the tech-industry discussion board Hacker News. No. 11 is a complaint about Google\u2019s search results looking too similar to its ads, while No. 12 is a link to an alternative, indie search engine. Clearly, others share Brereton\u2019s sense of search-engine discontentment. Sportswashing is the practice of laundering one\u2019s reputation through sports; whether that be through team ownership, hosting a major tournament, or sponsorship. A country or politician gets involved with the hope that some of the sport\u2019s popularity will improve their image. As the world\u2019s most popular sport, soccer is an effective vehicle for sportswashing. Saudi Arabia\u00a0recently purchased English Premier League team Newcastle United.\u00a0Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was trying to sell London\u2019s Chelsea F.C. before\u00a0the British government sanctioned him. When the British entered the Benin Oba (King\u2019s) palace, they found \u201cseveral hundred unique bronze plaques, suggestive of almost Egyptian design, but of really superb casting,\u201d according to Reginald Bacon, an intelligence officer with the expedition. Soldiers walked out with the plaques, along with other art, ivory, brass, jewelry and garments. Thousands of pieces were taken. They were \u201cnot just loot, they were blood art,\u201d Australian journalist Marc Fennell explained on the podcast \u201cStuff the British Stole.\u201d Indeed, word was sent back to Britain that selling off Benin\u2019s objects could help offset the cost of the war. In New York City, the police commissioner\u00a0can and often does\u00a0choose to ignore the results of CCRB-brought disciplinary trials. The commissioner can ignore guilty pleas and can even decide there should be no trial at all, as appears to be happening in this case. Last year, the police commissioner followed through on the CCRB\u2019s discipline recommendations in serious cases\u00a0just 27% of the time. I sent the NYPD a series of questions, asking both about its power to ignore the CCRB and about how that power has been wielded in this case. I got a\u00a0one-sentence response: \u201cThe disciplinary process is ongoing.\u201d We do know something about what\u2019s happened to the officers, and about their records. Thanks to legislation that New York state passed in the summer of 2020, police records are no longer secret. The CCRB\u2019s report names the officers involved. Trump\u2019s rise largely coincided with a push and pull over American exceptionalism that has now outlasted his presidency. Sides are not clean, are not divided by party or political orientation. The debate concerns not just what the United States is and can be, but in fact what this or any country can represent to its citizens and to the world. On the one hand are the exceptionalists\u2014those who hold faith in an America that is unique in the world and destined for greatness. Opposing the exceptionalists are a motley crew spread across right, left, and center who argue that America is, even beyond Trump\u2019s relatively amoral formulation, a force for ill. Let\u2019s call this inchoate ideology counter-exceptionalism. It\u2019s not\u00a0anti-exceptionalist\u2014that is, it is not simply an argument against American exceptionalism. Rather, it is an argument affirming exceptionalism\u2019s inverse: an ideology that argues that America either has always been, or has become, a unique force for ill in the world. Counter-exceptionalism has crept into our public spaces en masse\u2014and it is a force that threatens the political and cultural integrity both of the country as a whole and, in the more immediate term, of the ideological battles of those engaged in an earnest debate about how to better it. A left that cannot conceive of an America that has even the potential to be a force for good now struggles to make a positive argument for that good and concedes the grounds of hope and reconciliation to the exceptionalist right. The counter-exceptionalist right, meanwhile, has grown convinced of American decadence and decline\u2014it believes that the United States has become a sort of Sodom, and in that conviction has become increasingly hostile to democracy and amenable to violence as a legitimate political mechanism. In the first part of the finale on Monday, Clayton second-guessed everything and broke down in tears as he mourned Susie\u2019s departure. For some reason, this inspired him to be \u201ctransparent\u201d with Rachel and Gabby, who were waiting for him at the rose ceremony, since he was supposed to be narrowing the final three down to the final two. In what\u00a0host Jesse Palmer\u00a0excitedly called the \u201crose ceremony from hell,\u201d Clayton informed Rachel and Gabby that Susie left, and it had \u201cshattered\u201d him: \u201cI was in love with her. \u2026 I am in love with both of you. And I also was intimate with both of you.\u201d He admitted he had no idea whom to choose, and soon, the only sounds that could be heard were those of both Rachel and Gabby sobbing as they ran off in separate directions. Somehow (a producer\u2019s encouragement?), Clayton was able to cajole Rachel and Gabby to stick around and even meet his family, who had traveled to Iceland to meet his final two. Everyone pretended not to be miserable, especially Clayton, though afterward he did the worst thing: After putting everyone through that forced happiness, he realized the person he really loved was Susie. During one recent news bulletin on BBC Radio 4, the correspondent referred to \u201cPutin\u2019s baseless claim that the Ukrainian state supports Nazis\u201d. This is, itself, disinformation: it is an observable fact, which\u00a0the BBC itself\u00a0has previously reported on\u00a0accurately\u00a0and\u00a0well, that the Ukrainian state has, since 2014, provided funding, weapons and other forms of support to extreme Right-wing militias, including neo-Nazi ones. This is not a new or controversial observation. Back in 2019, I spent time in Ukraine interviewing senior figures in the constellation of state-backed extreme Right-wing groups\u00a0for\u00a0Harper\u2019s\u00a0magazine; they were all quite open about their ideology and plans for the future.\u00a0 Indeed, some of the best coverage of Ukraine\u2019s extreme Right-wing groups has come from the open-source intelligence outlet Bellingcat, which is not known for a favourable attitude towards Russian propaganda. Bellingcat\u2019s excellent reporting of this under-discussed topic over the past few years has largely focused on the Azov movement, Ukraine\u2019s most powerful extreme Right-wing group, and the one most favoured by the state\u2019s largesse.\u00a0 A New Zealand couple who believed they had dug up the world\u2019s largest potato in the garden of their small farm near Hamilton have had their dreams turned to mash after Guinness wrote to say that scientific testing had found it wasn\u2019t, in fact, a potato after all.  Colin Craig-Brown, who first hit the tuber with a hoe last August when gardening with his wife, Donna, said it sure looked and tasted like a potato. Mind you, he added, he\u2019s never tasted a gourd tuber.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t The war in Ukraine is growing more atrocious by the day, with Russian forces increasingly aiming bombs and missiles at civilians. Yesterday, airstrikes hit a theater sheltering hundreds of displaced families in the besieged city of Mariupol, the latest in a concerning number of recent \u201cindiscriminate attacks\u201d flagged by the United Nations as possible war crimes. Ukrainians are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, and while global aid organizations ramp up their important work, the arts community is doing its part to support them, raising funds and awareness. Some initiatives are already proving successful: Polish artist Karol Radziszewski\u2019s print of renowned Ukrainian poet and feminist pioneer Lesya Ukrainka, illustrated above, was sold out in less than three days and helped raise over $11,000 for relief efforts.  Below is a selection of ongoing art fundraisers, from online print sales to an in-person concert in New York City. All the organizers have said they will donate 100% of the proceeds to verified entities helping to alleviate the suffering caused by Russia\u2019s senseless war.  Four Ukraine-based art organizations \u2014 the Museum of Contemporary Art NGO (MOCA), Zaborona, the Naked Room, and Mystetskyi Arsenal \u2014 launched the\u00a0Ukrainian Emergency Art Fund (UEAF) to assist the nation\u2019s art community impacted by the war. The fund, administered by MOCA, offers one-time financial aid or stipends for up to three months for cultural workers from different sectors, from independent curators to researchers and writers. Donations can be made directly on the fund\u2019s website, which also provides a Google Docs form for those in danger to request help. \u201cWe immediately felt that this was not just an unexpected tyranny move from Putin, but actually a carefully planned imperialistic ambition of Russia to neo-colonise Ukraine in full spectrum: territory, soil, people and culture,\u201d\u00a0Ilya Zabolotnyi, CEO and co-founder of UEAF, told Hyperallergic. \u201cThat\u2019s when we understood that even during this war it is our task is to ensure the continuity and development of the Ukrainian cultural process during the war, so that the voice of cultural actors of Ukraine remains free, alive and strong.\u201d Artists at Risk (AR), a nonprofit founded by Marita Muukkonen and Ivor Stodolsky in 2013 to protect cultural workers escaping persecution and war, said it has received hundreds of applications from Ukrainian artists and others seeking relocation in recent weeks. The organization is raising funds for emergency resources, travel aid, and shelter through its Solidarity Prints fundraiser, featuring works by 70 artists all priced at \u20ac200 (~$222). The sale includes an untitled inkjet print by Rirkrit Tiravanija, whose newsprint collages invite a more profound reflection on current events. In this particular print, the artist overlaid the New York Times\u2019s surreal front page on February 24, the day of the Russian invasion, with a message of hope: \u201cShine Light Into Dark Places.\u201d Other artists in AR\u2019s sale include Nan Goldin, Isaac Julien, Sanya Kantarovsky, and Amy Sillman. This sensual and humorous painting by Brooklyn-based artist Jay Miriam is included in a fundraising sale for Ukraine organized by Her Clique, a group that elevates the work of women artists and supports like-minded nonprofits. Miriam is joined by Katharine Bradford, Deborah Kass, Marilyn Minter, Laurie Simmons, Cindy Sherman and other artists who donated work to help Voices of Children, a Ukrainian organization providing psychological support to the youngest victims of war. As the Russian invasion continues, Voices of Children is also aiding in evacuation efforts. New works will be added on Her Clique\u2019s website\u00a0every few days throughout the month of March, coinciding with Women\u2019s Month worldwide. The Brooklyn artist-run center Ortega y Gasset (OyG) will be auctioning one artwork per day on its Instagram account through March 25 with all proceeds benefiting the Ukrainian human rights organization Razom and the UN World Food Programme. The works were donated by artists currently included in OyG\u2019s Surface Tension exhibition and by the center\u2019s own directors. Bidding for each work will start at $100 and last 24 hours, with all bids recorded in the comments section of each artwork\u2019s Instagram post. Through mid-April, Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood is running a fundraising sale featuring many of the artists in its program, including Sandra Cinto, Sabine Hornig, Tom\u00e1s Saraceno, and Sarah Sze. All proceeds will be evenly distributed between the International Committee of the Red Cross; the Fundacja Ocalenie, which is helping Ukrainian refugees who arrive in Poland; and Voices of Children. According to a gallery spokesperson, the sale has raised over $400,000 so far. This Friday, March 18, over 50 musicians, dancers, and poets will perform in a five-hour concert to benefit Doctors Without Borders in Ukraine at the Clemente Flamboy\u00e1n Theater in Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. The event is organized by the Clemente Soto Cultural Center and two sound and music nonprofits, Arts for Art and Deep Tones for Peace. The lineup includes Frank the London Brass Band and a string ensemble led by violinist Jason Kao Hwang. William Parker, hailed as \u201cthe most consistently brilliant free jazz bassist of all time,\u201d will close the event with a full ensemble. Both virtual and in-person tickets are available, with a suggested donation of $25.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t Archaeological excavation at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris has unearthed several tombs and a leaden sarcophagus thought to date from the 14th century, France\u2019s Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot announced in a statement on Monday. Excavation work is taking place ahead of the reconstruction of the church\u2019s spire after a 2019 fire threatened to engulf the cathedral whole. The discoveries were made right beneath the intersection of the church\u2019s transept and its main body. Bachelot specified in her statement that the remains were found in \u201cremarkable scientific quality.\u201d Archaeologists speculate that the coffin \u2014 which visibly appears to have been dented by the weight of centuries of compression by earth and stones \u2014\u00a0contains the remains of an important church dignitary. A miniature\u00a0endoscopic camera was used to peer inside the sarcophagus, which allowed researchers to detect pieces of fabric, hair, and a pile of leaves resting on the head of the deceased \u2014\u00a0a typical funerary practice for religious figures.\u00a0 Several tombs and a leaden sarcophagus likely dating from the 14th century have been uncovered by archaeologists at\u00a0Notre Dame\u00a0Cathedral in Paris as work continues on the building\u2019s reconstruction after its devastating 2019 fire. https://t.co/KsAsyeVCs5 pic.twitter.com/eny4JIZnJr \u201cThe fact that these plant elements are still inside means the body is in a very good state of conservation,\u201d Christophe Besnier, lead archaeologist on the team, told the Guardian.\u00a0 In addition to the tombs and coffin, archaeologists have also identified parts of painted sculptures such as pieces from an original 13th-century rood screen, a decorative partition between the altar and the rest of the nave that is a common feature of late medieval church architecture. Agence France-Presse reported in a visit to the site of the excavation that archaeologists could be seen removing a bust of a bearded man and \u201csculpted vegetables\u201d from the earth. Also uncovered in the excavation was a subterranean heating system serviced by brick pipes dating from the 19th century. The conclusion of the excavation project, set for March 25, heralds the resumption of reconstruction work on the spire, which is to be completed in 2024, in time for the Summer Olympics in Paris.\u00a0 Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York has increased the presence of armed police officers on its premises in response to last weekend\u2019s horrific stabbing incident, which left two of its employees wounded. In an all-staff meeting on Monday, March 14, the museum\u2019s leadership informed workers that it has renewed a contract for paid security details with the New York Police Department (NYPD) to back up MoMA\u2019s guards, who are unarmed. The decision may be seen as controversial to some museum workers who had pushed management to end a previous contract with the NYPD in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020. The museum also hired details from a private security company, according to several people who attended the meeting. MoMA has not returned Hyperallergic\u2019s repeated requests for comment. The enhanced security measures come after a former museum member identified as 60-year-old Gary Cabana attacked and wounded two front desk employees at the museum\u2019s Film Center entrance on March 12. Security footage showed the suspect leaping over the reception desk and stabbing the workers \u2014 a man and a woman, both aged 24 \u2014 multiple times in the back, collarbone, and neck. Bellevue Hospital in Midtown Manhattan said both workers were in stable condition and would recover from their injuries. MOMA ATTACK: Police say they're looking for 60-year-old Gary Cabana for yesterday's brutal attack inside the Museum of Modern Art. They say both 24-year-old victims, a woman and a man, are now in stable condition. But this is new video they released of the stabbing. pic.twitter.com/bS5eHo54LO After three days on the run, Cabana was apprehended at a bus station in Philadelphia. According to John Miller, NYPD\u2019s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, the suspect was \u201cupset\u201d that he was denied entry to the museum after his membership was revoked due to two past incidents \u201cinvolving disorderly conduct.\u201d Friends and acquaintances of Cabana said that his mental health has deteriorated since he lost his job as a Broadway usher during the pandemic. In a now-removed post on Facebook, he alluded to living with a bipolar disorder. MoMA workers who spoke with Hyperallergic reported an atmosphere of fear and trepidation at the museum in the aftermath of the attack. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because employees were asked by leadership not to give interviews to the press. \u201cWe\u2019re shocked at what happened, but we\u2019re not entirely surprised,\u201d said one worker who regularly interfaces with visitors. \u201cWe constantly deal with members who throw tantrums, especially at the film department.\u201d The worker said that colleagues have previously expressed safety concerns about the film reception desk, saying it leads to a \u201ccul-de-sac\u201d and could leave workers trapped in the event of an attack. This scenario became a terrifying reality last week, as security footage showed the assaulted workers trapped behind the enclosed, curving desk. The museum has not responded to this allegation; the desk was relocated further inside the building after the attack. Workers at MoMA\u2019s Visitor Engagement department (or Visitor Services) count among the museum\u2019s most vulnerable, lowest-paid employees. The starting annual salary for a full-time Guest Assistant at MoMA is $36,131. After a year, a worker in the department becomes a Guest Specialist at $41,570. Salaries include benefits and tend to rise over the years based on seniority, largely thanks to years of contract negotiations between the museum and UAW Local 2110, the union representing MoMA workers and colleagues at other New York museums. \u201cWages are higher at MoMA because we\u2019ve been unionized for longer,\u201d said Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110, in an email to Hyperallergic. \u201cRates at museums that are non-union or have just unionized are much lower. At the Guggenheim and Whitney, for example, people start at $17-$18 an hour, are usually part-time, and don\u2019t have health benefits.\u201d Rosenstein added that the union is currently talking to workers at MoMA about what security measures they would like to see in light of the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s been very traumatic, especially for those who work in Visitor Services and Membership,\u201d she said.  Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

From the dialogues they build among themselves and with other artists, friends, and collaborators, these artists have established a personal language that enables them to present different layers of content and texture in their work. Origins of the PrizeBlack Mountain College (BMC) was a uniquely global college, with ideas and ideals grounded in worldviews that extend beyond the Western canon. In the same way, the legacy of the college has taken root across the globe, evolving and expanding to encompass disparate identities and forms of expression. Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center (BMCM+AC) is dedicated to preserving the history of BMC as well as facilitating new work through collaboration with contemporary artists. As they advance this mission they look to a blueprint set forth by BMC that valued the greater good, experimentation, and accountability. Funded by cultural pollinators Hedy Fischer and Randy Shull, the BMC Prize will allow BMCM+AC to continue on this path by building relationships and creating an impact with intention by supporting the creation of new work by the most innovative artists working within the BMC tradition today. The BMC Prize reflects the spirit of Black Mountain College as a place conducive to experimentation, where global social movements, communitarian efforts, and process-based practice flourished.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t SANTA FE, NM \u2014 This summer, hundreds of thousands of visitors are expected to convene in New Mexico\u2019s capital city, where the centennial edition of Santa Fe Indian Market is scheduled to take place in person on Saturday, August 20 and Sunday, August 21, 2022. According to the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA), the juried Native American art fair features approximately 1,000 Indigenous artists from over 200 federally recognized tribes selling works ranging from pottery and textiles to jewelry and paintings. It\u2019s a far cry from its beginnings 100 years ago, when the market\u2019s organizers didn\u2019t allow participating Native American artisans to be seen by the buying public. Today, the country\u2019s largest Native American public event, which features contemporary and traditional Indigenous art from the United States and Canada, is organized and produced by Kim Peone (Colville Confederated Tribes/Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians), who\u2019s supported by a staff of mostly Native American women. Throughout its history, the market has often responded to the country\u2019s changing sociopolitical climate and the evolving creative output of Indigenous artists. \u201cIt originally came from a preservation perspective of cultures and now it\u2019s evolved into this place of sustaining and supporting living cultures,\u201d says Peone, who became the executive director of SWAIA, the nonprofit that helms the market, in 2020. The market\u2019s debut in 1922, a smaller affair presented under the mouthful title of The Southwest Indian Fair and Industrial Arts and Crafts Exhibition, was held indoors rather than the bustling Santa Fe Plaza. The event, which included Navajo rugs and Plains Indians beadwork and basketry, focused on ceramics in an effort to revive Pueblo pottery making, according to Cathy Notarnicola, curator of Southwest history at the New Mexico History Museum. (The Santa Fe cultural institution, in partnership with SWAIA, is set to open the Tradition and Innovation exhibition on August 7, 2022 that chronicles the history of the market; it\u2019s scheduled to remain on view through August 2023.) Notarnicola adds that the event borrowed influences from the Panama\u2013California Exposition, a World\u2019s Fair-style shindig that took place in 1915. Edgar Lee Hewett, an archeologist and director of the Museum of New Mexico, attended the San Diego fair and later co-founded what would become Indian Market with Kenneth Chapman. The market attempted to capitalize on New Mexico\u2019s burgeoning tourist industry \u2014 tourism remains one of the state\u2019s largest money-making enterprises \u2014 that brought visitors to the Land of Enchantment via the Santa Fe Railway, Notarnicola explains. It was also in response to the various failed US government policies \u2014 including removal, reservation, and assimilation \u2014 that attempted to wipe out Indian Country. \u201cIt was like salvage ethnography in an attempt to try to save what was left of Indian cultures after all the devastating policies,\u201d says Notarnicola. \u201cThe first market came at it from an anthropological perspective, thinking that they were going to preserve Indian arts because we were on the brink of extinction,\u201d adds Peone. Native artisans weren\u2019t allowed to sell their works in-person at the market until 1931, which predated the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, a federal government policy that attempted to reverse the damages of cultural assimilation. The post-World War II federal Indian policy of termination and relocation \u2014 the US government ditched its relationships with tribes so that Native people could be \u201ccivilized\u201d into mainstream White society, often in the big cities \u2014 did a number on Indian Market. The cultural event bounced back in the 1960s with the beginning of the self-determination era and the 1962 establishment of the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA). Notarnicola says IAIA, founded by Lloyd Kiva New (Cherokee) and George Boyce, is often credited for the inception of contemporary Native art. Fritz Scholder (La Jolla Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians) and Allan Houser (Chiricahua Apache) taught at the Santa Fe school; alumni include current US poet laureate Joy Harjo (Muscogee/Creek), sculptor, ceramicist, Indigenous food activist, and gallerist Roxanne Swentzell (Santa Clara Pueblo), and the late painter and printmaker T.C. Cannon (Kiowa/Caddo). \u201cAnother major shift occurred with regards to the mission of the market, which, in its origination, preserved traditional designs and technologies of the past,\u201d says Peone. \u201cToday, the market honors and encourages innovation in its works of Native artists.\u201d In the 1970s, the market became a predominantly Native American-represented organization, according to Jamie Schulze (Northern Cheyenne), SWAIA director of operations, and has steadily grown. Today, the annual summer event attracts upwards of 150,000 visitors, who can talk with and purchase work from Native artists throughout approximately 17 city blocks in and around the historic Santa Fe Plaza. \u201cThere\u2019s a camaraderie that happens with artists and collectors where every year they get to see each other again and catch up on what\u2019s happened in the past year,\u201d says Notarnicola, who adds that she\u2019s seen the children of artists and collectors grow up together at the market over the last 30 years. Moving forward, Peone says Santa Fe Indian Market, which also produces a yearly winter market, will continue adapting to the contemporary moment while fostering personal and cultural sustainability for Native artists. \u201cWe are definitely pivoting,\u201d she says. \u201cWe really want to get away from an organization that only concentrates on two markets. How that comes about really comes from the perspective of partnerships and how we want to not only be a part of this community, but contribute to this community 365 days out of the year.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note, 03/18/22, 10:50am EDT: An earlier version of this article mistakenly identified the year Native artisans were allowed to sell work in person at the market as 1933. This has been corrected. Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t In 2010 and 2011, Robert Ryman (1930\u20132019) made a group of eight paintings measuring between 18 by 18 and 24 by 24 inches. All of them were done on mottled grounds in which the weave of the canvas was visible. The grounds were mossy green, dark brown, or earth red \u2014 colors we are apt to associate with nature. It is an association that Ryman would most likely have accepted, even as he would also have emphasized, in that soft-spoken demeanor he had, that nature was never a subject he pursued. These modestly scaled paintings \u2014 his last body of work before his death in 2019 \u2014 constitute the exhibition Robert Ryman: The Last Paintings at David Zwirner (February 10\u2013March 26, 2022), his first with the gallery, which now represents his estate.\u00a0 It is both unfortunate and understandable that Ryman became known during his lifetime as an abstract artist who used only white paint, because \u201cwhite\u201d is a generalizing term that suppresses all the nuances that one encounters in his work. In each of the exhibition\u2019s eight paintings, the ground is never uniformly one color, as the density of the tone changes. The tonal change becomes evident when the viewer stands close to the painting, which is something that Ryman must have wanted, because, with at least one work, one side is a darker hue than the painting\u2019s surface, suggesting that he added another brushstroke of thin color. These differences and shifts in the ground are picked up in the topography of brushstrokes he built up on the modulated surface, always leaving the painting\u2019s four edges visible.\u00a0 While the visceral shape always fits within the support\u2019s surface, its placement and relationship to the painting\u2019s physical edges vary, as do the brushstrokes. In \u201cUntitled\u201d (2010, 18 by 18 inches, oil on stretched cotton canvas), which was done on an earth-red ground \u2014 a color that also calls up Greek red-figure pottery \u2014 the shape comes right up to the edge on the painting\u2019s ride side, while Ryman left more space between the paint and the edge of the canvas on the left and along the top and bottom.\u00a0 In this painting, Ryman began with short gray-green brushstrokes, some of which he covered over as he added more paint. After this first layer, he added celadon strokes. By the time he added the thicker white brushstrokes (tinged with ochre yellow), he had already laid down two layers of paint. The white paint sits within the shape made by the first two layers, but Ryman did not try to cover all evidence of what preceded this final layer. The paint\u2019s thickness results in a rough, uneven surface in which the celadon strokes peek through, as do the gray-green strokes that extend beyond the white along the top left and side edges.\u00a0 While these turned out to be Ryman\u2019s last paintings, they do not feel that way \u2014 he did not know that he would have an accident and be unable to paint again. There is a joy to these paintings, as well as a playfulness, all arising from the artist\u2019s sensitivity to tone, contrast, placement, and natural light, which is how he would have wanted them to be seen. I remember Ryman suggesting that I go to one of his shows in the late afternoon, when the paintings would be illuminated by the darkening sky filtering in through the skylight. He wanted his work to be seen without being enhanced by artificial light.\u00a0 Ryman\u2019s preoccupation with the relationship between the painting and natural light brings me back to my initial suggestion that nature was key to his work. His belief in paintings as flat, square objects placed against the wall and seen in natural light, as things in the world, is the foundation upon which he developed his practice. That understanding of painting became the circumference within which he worked and where he found immense freedom and joy.\u00a0 While art historians and critics have predominantly focused on what Ryman absorbed from Mark Rothko \u2014 a consciousness of the painting\u2019s physical edge and the placement of the shape within \u2014 and from the cluster of creamy vertical and horizontal strokes in Philip Guston\u2019s paintings from the early 1950s, it seems to me that he also drew on other inspirations that might be considered unfashionable, which is why they are seldom if ever mentioned.\u00a0 Two of the artists that I am thinking about are Edwin Dickinson and Bradley Walker Tomlin, whose works were in the house Ryman and his wife, the artist Merrill Wagner, lived in for many years. Doesn\u2019t the green that Tomlin used in \u201cNumber 9: In Praise of Gertrude Stein\u201d\u00a0(1950) remind you of some of the greens one finds in Ryman\u2019s paintings? (Isn\u2019t it worth remembering that Guston dedicated a painting to Tomlin and readily admitted that he was an inspiration?)\u00a0 Ryman, who worked as a guard in the Museum of Modern Art for seven years, was an autodidact. He educated himself in the museum and never lost his initial curiosity about paint, materials, and the hardware that went into a painting. For him it was all a joy, inflected with a sense of humor. Nothing about painting was mundane. He knew everything he used had its own identity and he was respectful of that, down to the color of a nail and the shape of its head. The pleasure he took in seeing and sensing the world of things so closely is what viewers who are open to his work will take away.\u00a0 Just as Ryman considered the density and viscosity of paint, whether it was lead or titanium white (and how much red, blue, or yellow ochre it contained), different surfaces (aluminum, Tyvek, canvas, and linen), where to start and stop, and how to affix it to the wall, and was always conscious of every choice he made, always responsible for it, he invites viewers to do the same. We do not just look at a Ryman painting; we see ourselves looking at it, walking around it, scrutinizing the relationship of the painting\u2019s sides to the surface. He was not interested in having a painting reveal itself all at once, and in that regard he stood apart from many of his contemporaries\u00a0 In her groundbreaking book, Robert Ryman: Used Paint (2009) Suzanne P. Hudson cites the artist\u2019s statement about his beginnings:\u00a0 I thought I would see what would happen. I wanted to see what the paint would do, how the brushes would work. This was the first step. I just played around. I\u00a0had nothing really in mind to paint. I was just finding out how the paint worked, colors, thick and thin, the brushes, the surfaces.\u00a0 While Hudson focuses primarily on what Ryman learned by working in the Museum of Modern Art, where he took an art-education class on experimental painting in 1953 (although he claimed to have no detailed memories of what he learned in it), it should also be stressed that his approach to painting was influenced by his desire to be jazz saxophonist and his study with the pianist Lennie Tristano. When he abandoned that dream and focused on painting he remained true to something bebop musicians embraced: an openness to experiment and to discovering how the instrument worked. His approach to painting reminds me of Rahsaan Roland Kirk\u2019s experiments with all different kinds of saxophones (he was known to wear three around his neck when he played a concert). Disinterested in the idea of the masterpiece, Ryman defined a very different trajectory than that of his peers. \u00a0 Robert Ryman: The Last Paintings continues at David Zwirner (34 East 69th Street, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through March 26. The exhibition was organized by the gallery. Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t LONDON \u2014 How to characterize Jake and Dinos Chapman? The two brothers first made a big splash in the 1990s, when they fabricated a gruesome, three-dimensional version of an etching by Goya from a series called The Disasters of War. This assemblage of lopped and mutilated, mannequin-like human limbs hanging from a tree was shown in an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1997 called Sensation. It was a nasty piece of work. It likely made you wince because it seemed to lack compassion or human feeling of any kind. It was also entirely characteristic. The brothers seemed to revel in the business of provoking and outraging the world. They wanted to be seen as bruisers, Bad Boys, agents provocateurs. They bristled with a kind of sneery arrogance.\u00a0 I first met them at their studio in London\u2019s Old Kent Road in the autumn of 1998. Jake was the spokesman, the reader, the intellectual, the pushy one; Dinos tended to hang back. Our conversation rapidly declined into an unpleasant argument. Jake heaped mockery and derision on my shoulders. He told me that I knew nothing about art at all. He was even kind enough to give me a reading list. I told him that I honestly thought the 75-page catalogue essay he had written to accompany a show in New York was one of the most pretentious pieces of crap I had ever read, an ill-digested mash-up from bits of Heidegger, Sartre, and others, worthy of a teenager. Jake, I felt, was loving every minute of this bit of verbal brawling. This is how he wanted to engage with art critics and journalists. It would give him notoriety, enemies. And it did. It did. Their eye-catching acts of provocation continued. They reveled in it. They bought a collection of utterly banal paintings by Adolf Hitler, and painted over parts of them in silly and clownish ways. Once again, the action felt attention seeking. What they had done could be taken exception to in a variety of ways. Tastelessness, for example. Who in their right mind would wish to buy and then exhibit \u2014 and thereby associate themselves with \u2014 bad paintings by a monster called Hitler? And then daub over them?\u00a0 In 2003, they were shortlisted for the Turner Prize, and they put on a considered show of public outrage when they failed to win. Grayson Perry, who became more than their equal at the art of showmanship and look-at-me-ism, beat them to it. It was in that exhibition that they returned once again to Goya, who has proven to be an abiding obsession of theirs. This time they painted over an entire suite of those same etchings referred to above, adding clownish heads and other trivializing details of buffoonish defacement. Oh horror! How the art world howled! All very good for the Chapmans\u2019 publicity machine. And now we are all a quarter of a century older and wiser, and I am talking to Jake Chapman once again \u2014 the call is mediated by Yuval Etgar, the young Israeli curator who conceived this exhibition with him \u2014 over the telephone from his home in the Cotswolds, which is as far away in mood from the Old Kent Road as you could possibly conceive. Much else has changed. He and his brother have suffered a divorce. They are no longer quite that cheeky twosome, artistic bomb-tossers of the 1990s. Dinos now lives and works as a solo artist in Los Angeles. The Cotswolds, where his brother Jake has his home, is generally depicted as a snapshot of a timeless, sweet-faced rural idyll of the England that once used to be. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened then?\u201d I ask Jake. Was it a painless divorce? We were never joined at the hip, Jake tells me. It wasn\u2019t a symbiotic relationship. He always read a lot, whereas Dinos didn\u2019t. Is he still a Bad Boy? I wonder. He partly answers the question for me without my even having to ask. It\u2019s quite hard, he tells me, going from being a YBA to an OAP \u2026 The new show is, nevertheless, a thoroughgoing and unmistakably Chapman endeavor. Having said that, it is also less shrill and combative than in the past, and perhaps more calmly thought-provoking. Yet it still manages to include the odd whiff of quite deliberate \u2014 and perhaps even tasteless, if not downright unpleasant \u2014 provocation. The press materials tell us that the show \u2014 which is called Bad Manners \u2014 is an exploration of \u201cnon-consensual\u201d collaborations between artists from about the middle of the 19th century to the present day. You cannot help but linger over that compound adjective, \u201cnon-consensual,\u201d and quietly reflect upon the fact that it is most often used in the context of sexual assault. So the ante is being raised \u2014 as usual. So what exactly do we have in this gallery today? We have a number of works that could be described as cannibalistic: an artist has acquired a work by another artist and done something with it and to it \u2014 drawn on it, added to it, turned it into a part of something quite different from what it was in the first place, and\u00a0all without the permission of its creator. Once this happens, confusion sets in: who is now the creator of this work? Is there anger and dismay too? Not necessarily from the original creator because he or she may be dead, and therefore beyond the reach of caring at all.\u00a0 One of the most interesting examples of cannibalistic collaboration in this show is what looks like a smallish wooden coffee table raised up on a low plinth. In many respects it looks thoroughly unremarkable. And yet something rather odd has happened to its surface. In fact, set into that surface is an abstract painting by Gerhard Richter. Who had the barefaced cheek to turn a painting by Richter into the surface of something as banal and unremarkable as a coffee table on which you might easily and unthinkingly plonk down a cup of coffee? Martin Kippenberger did it, one of the postwar German bad boys \u2014 they do come in many different nationalities. And did Richter complain? I ask Yuval Etgar. Not as far as he knows. He probably thought it was quite a good joke. Artists generally don\u2019t complain when this sort of thing happens. They leave that to the collectors, the dealers, the advertising men. \u00a0 Bad Manners: On the Creative Potentials of Modifying Other Artists\u2019 Work continues at Luxembourg + Co. (2 Savile Row, London, England) through May 15. The exhibition was organized by the gallery in collaboration with Jake Chapman. Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t Against the backdrop of Cuba\u2019s ongoing assault on human rights, an otherwise prosaic image of a bus without passengers becomes unnaturally haunting. In Raychel Carri\u00f3n\u2019s monochrome graphite drawing \u201cRomper\u201d (2020) \u2014 \u201cto break\u201d \u2014 rows of empty bus seats emerge from a thick, textured darkness akin to smog. In the foreground, the distinct shape of a police baton can be discerned amid the sinuous curves of metal railings, chain-like patterns, and strap handles that resemble hooks \u2014 mundane elements made sinister. \u201cOn the 27th of January, in front of Havana\u2019s Ministry of Culture, agents of Cuban state police beat approximately 20 activists, artists, and reporters who were reading poetry,\u201d reads a wall label for the work now on view at Montserrat Gallery in Manhattan, written in Spanish. \u201cThat day it was shown that in Cuba, what is called \u2018culture\u2019 is just another arm of power and repression.\u201d An audio clip accompanying the piece amplifies the screams heard as officers apprehended participants of the pacific homage to Cuban author and journalist Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, shoving them onto the bus Carri\u00f3n so uncannily captured. Some of the artists included in Umbral, conceived by Havana-based curators Claudia Genlui and Anamely Ramos, were present that dark day in Havana, and are often on the frontlines of similar incidents so frequent in Cuba that they have become almost commonplace. In this exhibition of works by Cuban artists, activists, and members of the dissident San Isidro Movement, several names are familiar for their recurrence in headlines decrying state repression of free speech and creative freedom. One of Luis Manuel Otero Alc\u00e1ntara\u2019s symbolic Door paintings hangs next to a blue hard hat worn by the artist as part of a performance piece during the month of February 2020, after three children died when a building collapsed in Old Havana the previous year. Alc\u00e1ntara was detained several times for wearing the helmet in public, a wall text says. And he remains in a maximum-security prison in Havana at the time of this writing, behind bars for the last eight months as one of hundreds arrested during historic anti-government protests on the island last year. When Umbral opened on March 5, Genlui, his partner, had not heard from Alc\u00e1ntara in weeks and knew his health was rapidly declining after he declared a hunger strike in January; it was not his first.\u00a0 Last year\u2019s peaceful demonstrations in Cuba, which found echoes in solidarity protests around the world, were largely prompted by longstanding food and medicine shortages and poverty exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two prints by Aryam Rodriguez feature bottles of rum the Cuban government handed out to households last December, a strategy to deflect attention from these scarcities, as a wall text explains. The rum was distilled using sugar from the 2020-2021 Zafra harvest, dubbed the \u201cworst in the last 120 years in Cuba\u201d due to lack of fuel, machinery parts, and low yields. Ramos explains the resonance of the title Umbral, or \u201cthreshold,\u201d as \u201cthe idea of remaining at the entrance of something, but at a distance.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe fundamental thesis is that when you talk about Cuba, you have to enter a previous, introductory space, the Umbral, where certain notions that are difficult for the rest of the world to understand are explained through the voices of these artists who are in danger,\u201d Ramos told Hyperallergic at the opening of the show.\u00a0 The term encompasses the specific dystopia of voicing dissent while living on the island as well as the tension of existing as a Cuban citizen anywhere in the world, as the government maintains discretionary power to deny entry into or exit out of the country. Ramos currently finds herself currently inhabiting this \u201climinal space,\u201d she adds: When she attempted to return to Havana from the United States last month, gate agents prevented her from boarding the flight. \u201cUmbral was created from a place of permeability,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cIt is resistance, it\u2019s an attempt to reflect on what a frontier is, where Cuba begins and where it ends, and what it means to be safe in Cuba today.\u201d Artist Camila Lob\u00f3n, a Camag\u00fcey native whose works on view include illustrations designed for various civic actions on the island, recently completed a residency in Miami and plans on returning to Cuba. \u201cThe generation I identify with has a deep consciousness around this question of naturalizing the fact of returning, of entering and leaving and coming back, of regaining our ownership over the territory,\u201d Lob\u00f3n told Hyperallergic.\u00a0 \u201cIn my case, I don\u2019t think about the concept of country or nationalism \u2014 it\u2019s my home, it\u2019s where the people I love are, and for that reason, I have the right to be there,\u201d she said. In their subtle elegance, Lob\u00f3n\u2019s drawings are tacitly subversive. One of them depicts three stages in the metamorphosis of a butterfly labeled with the words \u201cresistance, contempt, and disobedience,\u201d the charges on which rapper Maykel Osorbo was arrested in May 2021. Another, a drawing of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed modeled after Cuban modernist Jorge Arche\u2019s iconic portrait of the writer, was made for a \u201cpoetic pilgrimage\u201d calling for the liberation of rapper Denis Solis in 2020. \u201cI have two homelands: Cuba and the night,\u201d it reads, citing Mart\u00ed\u2019s poem. \u201cOr are they one?\u201d \u201cCarolina [Barrero], a historian and activist, had the idea of making these as posters and giving them away. We never got to do that, because police intervened in her home, found the prints, and accused her of \u2018clandestine printing,\u2019\u201d Lob\u00f3n said. \u201cSomething as simple as the image of Mart\u00ed, because of the gesture it implied about autonomy over an image, over an idea, is seen as an act of rebellion in Cuba.\u201d\u00a0 Alexis Romay, a Cuban writer and teacher who attended the opening of Umbral, left the island in 1999. When asked if he plans on returning, he quotes Heraclitus: \u201cNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it\u2019s not the same river and he\u2019s not the same man.\u201d \u201cI resist the hyphen: I don\u2019t call myself \u2018Cuban-American.\u2019 I am profoundly Cuban,\u201d Romay told Hyperallergic. \u201cBut like many other Cubans, I told myself that I cannot return to that Cuba. I can\u2019t return to a place from which I escaped.\u201d \u201cWhat they are doing \u2014 Anamely, Camila, Claudia \u2014 is asserting the idea that this country is ours,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever step on Cuban soil again, but if I do, it\u2019s because of them. They are returning to me a country that I had lost.\u201d A screen plays the music video for \u201c\u00bfDe qu\u00e9 me van a hablar?\u201d (\u201cWhat are they going to talk to me about?\u201d) (2021) shot by Anyelo Troya and featuring Osorbo and Elexer Funk \u201cEl Funky,\u201d which calls for freedom for Alc\u00e1ntara and members of the San Isidro Movement. Osorbo and El Funky are co-authors of \u201cPatria y Vida,\u201d which became a rallying cry for freedom during the peaceful protests of July 2021. When the video for that song began to \u201cspread like wildfire\u201d among Cubans, wrote curator Coco Fusco for Hyperallergic, the government launched a defamation campaign against it that included homophobic attacks. Osorbo is currently in prison and El Funky lives in exile in the US. Troya is in Havana with a yearlong order that restricts his mobility.\u00a0 In a small room in the back of the gallery, Indira Romero, a Cuban artist and performer, offers tarot readings with a deck of cards illustrated by many of the artists in the show. The High Priestess was designed by Lob\u00f3n, a jovial portrait of Cuban salsa musician Celia Cruz mid-song against a background of papayas. Hamlet Lavastida, who was forced into exile last year after three months in prison in Cuba, drew number 15, the Devil: the unmistakable silhouette of Fidel Castro pointing a gun.\u00a0 \u201cOur cry should not be in vain,\u201d Genlui wrote in a statement for the exhibition. \u201cLuis Manuel always said that art gives us the possibility of helping everyone understand. Today, he and Maykel assume that cry in the form of extreme sacrifice; today, through curation and art, we are by their sides, we transit that threshold and we invite the world to understand us.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement. Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t Ask why blue-chip photography galleries represent fewer women than men, and you might hear a supply-side argument: \u201cA century ago, there just weren\u2019t that many women making museum-quality work.\u201d A Female Gaze: Seven Decades of Women Street Photographers, now on view at Howard Greenberg Gallery, proves this theory false. Encompassing work by 12 women photographers that spans the course of the 20th century, this impressive exhibition showcases these artists\u2019 creative ingenuity and their raw technical skill. The exhibition title cleverly inverts Laura Mulvey\u2019s concept of \u201cthe male gaze\u201d \u2014 which, according to Mulvey\u2019s well-known essay, objectifies and fetishizes its female subjects \u2014 while rightly acknowledging that its artists\u2019 perspectives are not universal; it is a vision, not the vision.  A Female Gaze includes a wide range of street photography, not all of which was taken at street level. Several works by Ruth Orkin were taken looking down from the artist\u2019s apartment window, giving the scenes an angled, almost Constructivist appearance. \u201cMan in Rain\u201d(1952) is one such image, which masterfully captures individual raindrops \u2014 no easy feat, even with today\u2019s digital technology. Berenice Abbott\u2019s show-stopping aerial photograph \u201cNight View, New York\u201d(1932) is one of those works that now looks clich\u00e9 because of the decades of photographers who have tried to imitate it. The level of detail in the gargantuan gelatin silver print is startling; despite the photograph\u2019s 15-minute exposure time, one can still make out the rooms behind each illuminated window. Many of the women in A Female Gaze were members of the Photo League, a New York cooperative of socially conscious photographers that was active from 1936 until 1951, when its leftist origins landed it on a Justice Department blacklist. The organization championed work that was both aesthetically composed and socially significant; for example, Helen Levitt, one of the better-known female photographers associated with the group, documented children on the on the streets of New York and the chalk drawings they left behind. One of the works from this series, \u201cN.Y.\u201d (c. 1942), depicts a delightfully youthful chalk portrait of a girl with a sly smile. Positioned so that only the plane of the sidewalk is in view, the photograph itself becomes a kind of abstract drawing, recalling Brassa\u00ef\u2019s Graffiti photo series of the 1930s. Women like Levitt made up almost a third of the League\u2019s membership, serving significant roles within the organization at a time when women were rarely allowed such agency. Whether these women of the Photo League were really \u201cencouraged equally alongside their male counterparts\u201d as the press release claims is up for debate; as Catherine Evans writes in The Radical Camera: New York\u2019s Photo League 1936-1951, the League \u201cencouraged women but did not entirely support them.\u201d Photo League editors \u2014 just like their gallery and institutional counterparts \u2014 favored work by male photographers, leaving many of the group\u2019s female members to return to the domestic roles that society expected of them. Today, much of their work has been lost. Hopefully, A Female Gaze signals a new direction for Howard Greenberg Gallery\u2019s program, which has skewed disproportionately white and male. While the art world has become increasingly conscious of gender and racial inequity in recent years \u2014 and the gallery itself is predominantly staffed by women \u2014 its program has in fact become less equal along gender lines over the past decade. From 2013 to 2015, its website indicates that 26 percent of its solo exhibitions were of female artists; from 2016-2018, as the MeToo movement gained traction, this figure dropped to 18 percent. Since 2018, solo presentations by female artists now stand at a dismal 7 percent. Of the 66 artists that Howard Greenberg lists as representing on its primary roster, 10 of them are women. (Only two Black artists are included in this list: Gordon Parks and James Van Der Zee.) From its inception, Howard Greenberg Gallery has championed a socially conscious approach to photography similar to that of the Photo League; a pioneer in the art market, the gallery fought for photojournalism and street photography\u2019s place in the canon. Its program, however, hasn\u2019t always matched its ethos. As one of New York City\u2019s leading photo galleries\u2014particularly as one that describes its collection as \u201ca living history of photography\u201d\u2014it should strive to represent an accurate, more complete view of that history. As Mary Ellen Mark once said, \u201cnothing is more interesting than reality.\u201d A Female Gaze: Seven Decades of Women Street Photographers continues at Howard Greenberg Gallery (41 East 57th Street, Suite 801, Midtown, Manhattan) through April 2.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t The Museum of the Moving Image\u2019s annual First Look program is a terrific way for New Yorkers to see some of the most exciting new experimental film and documentary work emerging early each year. The 2022 iteration includes several timely works about Ukrainian/post-Soviet history, a pre-COVID meditation on isolation from Poland, a survey of men who live in abandoned missile launch silos, and much more.  One of the more exciting picks is As Mine Exactly, a virtual reality performance piece by filmmaker Charlie Shackleton. During the experience, a participant sits across from Shackleton in a room and straps on a VR headset. Shackleton then reads his lines aloud in the room as imagery from his youth plays on the participant\u2019s screen, laying out the story of his mother\u2019s experiences with epilepsy and how seeing her seizures as a boy impacted him. He not only narrates, but also \u201cconverses\u201d with his mother, whose voice is heard through a speaker positioned behind the viewer. By actively mediating the participant\u2019s interactions with this anecdote, Shackleton draws attention to the ways we already reframe and perform our pasts, both in how we personally process events and how we relate them to others.  Hyperallergic sat down with Shackleton over Zoom to discuss the piece and the logistical and artistic headaches involved in making it. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and brevity. * * * Hyperallergic: Why was it important that you be a physically present part of this experience? Charlie Shackleton: I had qualms about telling this story on film to begin with, because it felt so personal, intimate, and sensitive. Some of the material and experience I let people in on, I was daunted by. I think when I had the idea of it becoming a one-on-one performance, that felt like it circumstantially matched what it represented to me to be sharing this story. However I did it, it would\u2019ve felt like I was confiding in the audience, so why not stage it in such a way that I am literally doing that? And everything that would bring to the performance would heighten the themes of the story. It is so much about presence and absence, so to have me present with the viewer underlined that in a way nothing else really could. H: Especially since, even though you are physically present, there\u2019s the distancing element of the audience member wearing the VR headset. CS: Yeah. It\u2019s fascinating to watch people do it. You\u2019re intensely close to someone in a way that you almost never are with a stranger. I\u2019m staring at their face for half an hour, but they can\u2019t see me back. They can hear me, how proximate I am to them, but it\u2019s a weird kind of proximity that\u2019s unlike anything else. I come out of it \u2014 and I think they come out of it \u2014 feeling both really close to the other person but also weirdly alienated from them. And again, that felt right for this. I can\u2019t imagine doing another piece like this, because I don\u2019t know what kinds of stories it would suit. H: How did you prepare to perform this way? What effect have the performances so far had on you? CS: I think I prepared in all the wrong ways. [laughs] I did have a long time to think about it, and I knew that it was going to be exhausting \u2014 emotionally, physically, even technically, having to be in command of the various components. All that turned out to be true, but in a different way than I ever could\u2019ve imagined. I think what I didn\u2019t really prepare myself for was how psychologically intense it is for a succession of different people go through something emotionally with you. And the reactions really varied. Sometimes it was easy to tell how someone was feeling, sometimes it was quite hard. But I think it left a psychic impact on me as well, just watching them receive it. H: Subjectivity is a recurring theme in your work.   CS: My short Personal Truth made me think about the layers of mediation in telling a personal story. Not only was my notionally conversational voiceover obviously scripted and had been reread so many times in recording it, but also what I was expressing as my unvarnished perspective was of course heavily filtered. It had been through many rounds of drafts in an attempt to make it satisfying, structurally and emotionally. I\u2019d always had this slightly uneasy relationship with how I presented myself in my own work; it\u2019s a strange semi-real, semi-unreal version. I knew that in telling a story that was so personal, I had to confront that within it. It would be dishonest to say that I can tell a story about this incredibly formative part of my life impartially or without artifice. H: How did you plot out what to put into the headset screen, and how to present it, edit it, arrange it, and more? CS: One of the things I like about that technology is that it feels experimental. You put the headset on and you can decide what you\u2019re going to do inside it; it can be completely spontaneous and impulsive. I didn\u2019t see that reflected in any of the broadly defined \u2018film work\u2019 being made for VR. It instead felt like everything was super polished. There\u2019s a focus on immersion that leads people toward sanding off all the rough edges and making grand statements. I was interested in VR as a DIY tool, especially because the technology is still so ropy and breaks as often as it works. It\u2019s only as useful as what it allows you to do, not for its own innate being. I wanted to make something that would evolve quickly and responsively as I was road-testing it. It\u2019s never going to stop evolving as long as I\u2019m performing it. It\u2019s already changed quite a lot just over the course of a week of doing it. The material evolved in response to showing it to people. I had endless material, thousands of childhood photographs and videos and things I\u2019d written, things my mom had written, any of which could\u2019ve been included \u2014 and a lot of which was included, at one point or another. But when you get someone in a headset, it\u2019s fascinating to see where their focus sharpens and where it doesn\u2019t. I can see where they\u2019re looking, what\u2019s catching their attention and whether that aligns with my intention. Those moments are what I tried to build the piece around. Initially I did what I think 99% of people who first make work for VR do, which is shoot a load of 360-degree footage. But because my piece is a theatrical performance as much as it is a work of VR, I had two spaces I needed to orchestrate: the 360-degree canvas of the headset and the physical space I and the participant occupy. And often the two worked against each other. I found that if I started the piece and all I gave them to look at was an image I put directly in front of them, they would focus intensely forward on that spot, which was where I was in the room. That bond was intense, and something I could exploit to create the intimate relationship the piece relies on. But when I showed them a 360-degree video, that bond was instantly severed; they\u2019d look around, look behind themselves. And as fun or immersive as it might\u2019ve been, I never got back that focus. That led me to strip back how much of the virtual canvas I occupied, to maintain control of the audience member\u2019s focus. Something that\u2019s also interesting about VR is the void, which you don\u2019t often get to see because most of the work is so visually populated. You don\u2019t usually get to linger on the strange absence of a frame, but I think that\u2019s intriguing. If I put something in someone\u2019s peripheral vision in a space they had gotten used to being blank, you can see how radical it is for them to suddenly breach this imagined wall. That wouldn\u2019t be the case if I had quickly filled in all the space and shown them a 360-degree vision of my childhood street. H: What technical and artistic changes have you made in this road-testing process? CS: Pacing is probably the biggest thing. What feels right when I\u2019m rehearsing feels totally different in an actual atmosphere with a human being. The pauses are often much longer now than I ever imagined they would be, either because the person is reacting in some way that I need to leave space for, or just because something strikes me in the moment and it feels like it needs to breathe. I also need to reassure people as early as possible that they don\u2019t have to perform. I really need to get that in the synopsis. If I was a viewer, I would be put off by the idea that it was immersive theater, where you have to play a role. I don\u2019t want to only have a self-selecting audience of people who would be up for that kind of thing. It needs to be clear that it\u2019s very low-key, low pressure, that the experience is ultimately being told a story by another human being.

Ukraine has got you covered, with a new stamp that commemorates Ukrainian soldier Roman Gribov\u2019s reply to a Russian warship that asked his force on Snake Island to surrender: \u201cRussian warship, go fuck yourself!\u201d Ukraine\u2019s first deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzheppar, announced the stamp in a tweet earlier this week. The stamp\u2019s design, featuring a panoramic view of a Ukrainian soldier giving an approaching Russian warship the middle finger, was created by Ukrainian artist Boris Groh and submitted to a public contest by the Ukrainian Postal Service (Ukrposhta).  The postage stamp named \"Russian warship, go f**k yourself!\" will appear in\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6.  The sketch by artist Boris Groh received the most votes and will soon be published by Ukraine's state postal company.\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\u270c\ufe0f#StandWithUkraine#StopRussianAgression pic.twitter.com/ByYAzw2tYq Groh\u2019s entry was the winner through social media upvotes, beating out a field of four finalists that included a graphic sinking Russian warship with the included text dripping blood; a subtle Snake Island carved out against a Ukrainian yellow ocean and blue sky telling a huge Russian warship to fuck itself; and one that rendered the small troop of soldiers stationed on the island on a little bit of land, buoyed by their iconic battle cry. Groh proved that a picture is worth a thousand words, as the only entry to elide the phrase entirely, replacing it with a single, eloquent gesture. The stamp is only the latest in what is being considered a masterful public image campaign on the part of Ukraine, encouraging national fortitude and international aid through a heady combination of stalwart determination to hold their ground, and wacky memes. Just as their Russian foes were early adopters of social media as a tool for disinformation and passive disruption of international politics, Ukraine seems to well understand the power of propaganda as a rallying call. And while it is somewhat unorthodox to put literal profanities on postage stamps, and canonize those who utter them as national heroes, it feels extremely fitting given the circumstances.  Not only does it offer Ukranians something to hold onto as they continue their struggle, the new stamp also prvides a future opportunity to mail in Ukrainian parking tickets, tax filings, and other hate mail with a little something extra spicy on the envelope.

        "text": "Hyperallergic \n\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t Maryland\u2019s last public Confederate monument, the \u201cTalbot Boys Statue\u201d outside the Talbot County courthouse in Easton,\u00a0was removed on March 14. The move marked a resolution to two decades of contestation over the statue, which will now be moved to Cross Keys Battlefield in Harrisonburg, Virginia, where it will be stewarded by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation. Standing at 13 feet in height at the courthouse lawn, the monument portrays a Confederate regiment from Talbot County that served in the Civil War. Erected in 1916, a single soldier totes a Confederate flag and peers into the distance wistfully. The granite base is inscribed with the names of 96 Confederate soldiers associated with the county in some way, with the front reading, \u201cTo the Talbot Boys / 1861-1865 / C.S.A.\u201d Previously positioned prominently on the greens just outside the courts where local residents would have to get essential business taken care of, the statue was a visual reminder of the persistence of unequal justice and racism in the United States. It also occupied the very spot where a slave auction block once stood. Guess what you don\u2019t see in this picture? The Talbot Boys. The last confederate monument on public grounds in Maryland is gone. Frederick Douglass finally has the lawn to himself. Congrats to all involved @MTMCoalition @BoysTalbot  cc: @cncep @ClintSmithIII pic.twitter.com/jY0QkXlLcH The county council voted to remove the monument in September after several failed attempts in 2015, 2016, and 2020. Subsequently, a nonpartisan coalition of local citizens came together under the banner of the Move the Monument Coalition to raise $82,000 for the relocation of the statue.\u00a0 While Maryland was part of the Union in the Civil War, many of its counties were divided, including Talbot County. There, family members found themselves fighting each other in battle. Although three times as many fought for the Union as for the Confederacy in the county, a promised Union monument to accompany the Confederate one was never realized. As such, Talbot County is often misremembered as a Confederate bastion in the state. A statue of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who was born just 12 miles away, does stand on the lawn, though it was only erected in 2011 after a long fight. #BREAKING: it\u2019s a big day in Easton today: the Talbot Boys Confederate monument is coming down. The statue came down earlier. Now crews are preparing to remove the base. #TalbotBoys #Easton @stardem_news pic.twitter.com/xOFlTuHYLP Put in place almost half a century after the end of the Civil War \u2014 when the sun was already setting on the era of Reconstruction and Confederate nostalgia was on the rise \u2014 the statue was spearheaded by Joseph Seth, a lawyer and eventual mayor of Easton. In his memoir, he expressed that enslaved people \u201clived under a paternal, kindly rule\u201d on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, regurgitating sentimentally violent falsehoods about the antebellum South. The statue was therefore \u201cerected at a time when Confederate statues were used as a means of racial intimidation,\u201d a legal complaint filed by the Talbot County Branch of the NAACP against the county in May 2021 read. A public information request late last year showed that almost 900 people had contacted the Talbot County council about the statue during a public comment period. Of that group, over 700 argued for its removal. \u201cFrederick Douglass finally has the lawn to himself,\u201d tweeted Maryland resident Sandy Boyd, CEO of the nonprofit Seek Common Ground. \u201cCongrats to all involved.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.

        "text": "By RealClearWire  March 23, 2022 at 1:47pm By David Craig\u00a0&\u00a0John Waters for RealClearDefense Appearing last week in an olive-green t-shirt, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an impassioned plea to a joint session of Congress for a \u201chumanitarian no-fly zone,\u201d as well as more air defense systems, armed drones, and other weapons. To help make his case, he invoked Pearl Harbor and Sept. 11, \u201cwhen evil tried to turn [American] cities into battlefields,\u201d drawing parallels to the carnage in Ukraine over the past three weeks. The argument was compelling and sincere. Since last Wednesday, the White House promised an additional 800 million U.S. dollars to bolster the people fighting to defend their homes and neighborhoods against an invading army. But the outlook for Ukraine is grim. RELATED: FLASHBACK: Congress Banned Arms From Going To Neo-Nazis In Ukraine In 2018 Russia\u2019s military is nearly four times the size of Ukraine\u2019s and consequences of the mismatch have already been devastating. Vehicles incinerated with helpless victims inside. Hospitals bombed, families separated, women and children fleeing to western Ukraine and beyond. The truth is war means separation from family. It destroys who you were and takes away everything you had planned for your future. What we watch happening in Ukraine seems strangely foreign. Pictures of combat shock the conscience, jarring loose old memories of battlefield carnage and its toll on the innocent, young and old. We realize now these are things we will never forget. And yet, the fighting in Melitopol and Mariupol is hard for us to relate to, much less understand. Our military training and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan were predicated on always being the superior force\u2014having the weapons, manpower, and logistical re-supply to overwhelm a smaller, if determined, enemy. Despite our own combat experiences over many years, it is difficult to put ourselves in the shoes of Ukrainian foot soldiers standing at the barricades in downtown Kyiv, wondering if a Russian tank or bomber awaits in the darkness.  Putin\u2019s aggression should not come as a shock. Already it has been nearly a decade since the Russian Federation annexed Crimea then intervened militarily in the Syrian Civil War. Along the way, redlines and threats have done little to chasten Putin. His tactics have always been brutal. He supported Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian dictator who used chemical weapons to kill and disfigure hundreds of his own people. He either authorized or condoned the Russian Federation\u2019s use of chemical weapons in at least two attempts to assassinate his political enemies, both of which violated the Chemical Weapons Convention. Because Putin has the means and motive, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if he employs weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine, too. We fear the worst is yet to come. America has acquitted itself honorably in response. In addition to providing money and materiel to Ukrainian fighters, Western nations have leveled enormous sanctions against Putin, seeking to cut off his regime from the global financial system. The effects of the sanctions are already reverberating. \u201cOur economy will need deep structural changes in these new realities,\u201d Putin said in televised remarks last Wednesday. \u201cI won\u2019t hide this\u2014they won\u2019t be easy [;] they will lead to a temporary rise in inflation and unemployment.\u201d This was an understatement. RELATED: Ukraine Suspends Opposition Political Parties, Zelensky Nationalizes All Privately-Owned Media Companies The United States and Western allies have begun an economic war against Russia that will reveal itself through surging gas, metal, and food prices for countries around the world. Food shortages and high prices will hit hardest in the developing world, and civil unrest could follow. We have no doubt the economic war will have significant human costs. And yet, some are asking for more. From a no-fly zone to cyberattacks directed against Russian command and control networks, politicians and foreign policy experts seem intent on prodding the U.S. toward a deeper military involvement, one with uncertain costs and an even less certain end state. American military veterans are traveling to Ukraine, either to pick up arms alongside the defenders or simply to collect a photo op before jetting back to the States. It has been strange to watch. We would have thought that 20 years\u2019 worth of poor returns in Afghanistan and Iraq would be enough to humble our interventionist instincts, especially in the context of another war complicated by ethnic, cultural, and historical elements which few in the West understand. Instead, we see signs of the same recklessness and arrogance of 2001 and 2003, nearly unabated by two decades of defeat. We\u2019re old enough to recall a time when Americans expected to be greeted as liberators in Iraq and Afghanistan, when a radical new strategy of counterinsurgency would redeem our efforts to save Iraq, when regime change was the prudent course of action in Libya and when an \u201cArab Spring\u201d was imminent, a new future for the Middle East on the horizon. RELATED: Video: Comedian Trolls City Council By \u2018Recruiting\u2019 Volunteers For \u2018World War 3\u2019 In Ukraine None of it turned out to be true. It\u2019s not hard to see some of the same impulses playing out in policy discussions about how far we should go to counter Russian aggression. They say the definition of insanity is \u201cdoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\u201d Let us not allow the emotions of the moment\u2014our empathy for the people of Ukraine or our revulsion at Putin\u2019s ruthlessness\u2014to exhaust our ability to think critically about America\u2019s interests in eastern Europe.

        "text": "By RealClearWire  March 23, 2022 at 12:47pm By Adam Andrzejewski for RealClearPolicy Los Angeles has dedicated $1.2 billion to a new program fighting homelessness, but instead of maximizing the budget\u2019s impact, the city is spending up to $837,000 per unit to house homeless people. An\u00a0audit\u00a0released by Los Angeles City Controller Ron Galperin shows that Proposition HHH, a ballot measure that issued a $1.2 billion bond to fight homelessness in 2016, has been an abject failure. The audit states that \u201cmore people are unhoused today than when Prop. HHH passed in 2016.\u201d Plagued by high costs and major delays, Proposition HHH has left taxpayers with a $1.2 billion bill, and even more homelessness.\u00a0 One of the most egregious parts of the report shows the cost of new units being built to house homeless residents. Most units being built are meant to accommodate one person. RELATED: This Chart Shows Just How Badly Inflation Is Outpacing Any Supposed Wage Increases There is at least one building in the predevelopment phase that is expected to cost $837,000 per unit. Another 12 projects being planned or built are expected to cost more than $700,000 per unit, and another 41 will cost more than $600,000 per unit. Despite the measure passing more than five years ago, only 18 projects have been completed so far. Another 65 projects are under construction and 27 projects are still in the predevelopment stage.  In response to ballooning costs and delays in completion, the city controller recommended that the city speed up the review process, acquire and convert existing buildings for housing, build interim housing using available funds, and reevaluate expensive or stalled projects before finalizing loans. Of these, the City of Los Angeles has only decided to implement the first two. Apparently, reassessing out-of-control spending is too much to ask from Los Angeles.

        "text": "By Rusty Weiss  March 23, 2022 at 11:28am A new report demonstrates just how badly rising prices from inflation are outpacing any wage gains experienced by American workers over the past year. The Biden administration has repeatedly spun the economic numbers to try and convince the public that they are better off due to wage increases. \u201cFor many Americans, wages are up this year,\u201d the President said in remarks on the latest jobs report last month. \u201cThat\u2019s good \u2014 we have to continue to keep wages growing. And we need even more high-paying jobs.\u201d \u201cEven after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year,\u201d Biden said prior to that. Even fact-checkers have scoffed at that statement, with Factcheck.org calling the claim \u201cmostly malarkey.\u201d And now, a new report from the Urban Institute demonstrates just how false this claim is in reality. Wage increases are not keeping up with inflation, but that won\u2019t stop @wildforcongress from claiming the complete opposite! #PA07https://t.co/c83d0RDCPp pic.twitter.com/LfDDLh7Lbl \u2014 Samantha Bullock (@SamLBullock) March 22, 2022  RELATED: Expert Warns America: Get Ready For $5 A Gallon Gas Very Soon  A post on the Urban Wire blog shows how wages aren\u2019t even vaguely keeping pace with rising prices due to inflation \u2013 focusing on fuel prices and rent. \u201cFor Americans, recent dramatic surges in gas prices and rent have increased the costs of daily life at a quicker rate than wages,\u201d author Yonah Freemark writes. Axios reported on the news and reproduced a chart from the Urban Institute that really outlines the true cost of inflation for the American people. Wage increases are not keeping up with inflation Wages rose 5% over the past year, while inflation increased by 7.9%, rents in metropolitan areas jumped by 15% and gas prices soared by 40%.https://t.co/1MX3dtTZaj \u2014 Steven Greenhouse (@greenhousenyt) March 22, 2022  That is a brutal visualization that hammers home the reality of what is happening to budgets, paychecks, and wallets in homes all across this nation, regardless of how the Biden administration tries to spin it. Under President Biden, inflation has soared to a 40-year high, while real wages have fallen. Inflation has outpaced wages every single month since he signed a $1.9 trillion spending bill into law. That\u2019s the reality facing voters every single day. Every time they fill their gas tank. Every time they purchase groceries.\u00a0 Bidenflation is hitting real wages and costing American families $300 more every single month. But instead of offering real solutions, Biden is playing the blame game. It\u2019s time for him to step up and lead. American families can\u2019t wait another second. \u2014 Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) March 18, 2022  RELATED: Bloomberg Lectures Americans On Inflation: Eat Lentils, Take The Bus, And Let Your Pets Die In a remarkable revelation, the Urban Institute report notes that Bidenflation is battering minority communities at a higher rate, something that would have allowed the media to brand the President\u2019s predecessor as a racist. \u201cHouseholds with low incomes\u2014who are disproportionately people of color\u2014will likely be particularly affected by these changes,\u201d Freemark writes. Women, people of color and single parents disproportionally represent low-wage workforce https://t.co/YYGbrV28YQ pic.twitter.com/auLV1RO1qd \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) March 23, 2022  Oh, and pivoting to electric vehicles to save on skyrocketing gas prices as the Biden administration has advised? Maybe not quite as feasible as they\u2019d like to think. The Institute writes that while electric vehicles are gaining in popularity, \u201cfew Americans currently have them, and those who do are relatively wealthier on average.\u201d In other words, the White House can\u2019t figure out why you poor plebeians can\u2019t afford a pricy new vehicle as easily as they can.

An excerpt reveals that Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield blamed Harris for her own horrendous first year in office \u2013 and that it maybe shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise: \u201cIn private, Bedingfield had taken to noting that the vice presidency was not the first time in Harris\u2019s political career that she had fallen short of sky-high expectations: Her Senate office had been messy and her presidential campaign had been a fiasco. Perhaps, she suggested, the problem was not the vice president\u2019s staff.\u201d Bedingfield gave a non-denial denial of the claim in a response to Politico, saying: \u201cThe fact that no one working on this book bothered to call to fact check this unattributed claim tells you what you need to know. Vice President Harris is a force in this administration and I have the utmost respect for the work she does every day to move the country forward.\u201d  Another bit in the book reveals that Harris and Biden\u2019s weekly lunches \u201clacked a real depth of personal and political intimacy.\u201d Finally a voice of reason.

There are millions of people in the United States, she began. Why, she asked, do we have to choose the one who attacked Joe?\u201d The First Lady, already no fan of Kamala Harris, was referencing a presidential debate where then-candidate Harris attacked candidate Biden for racist busing views in the past.\u00a0 In the debate, Harris said, \u201cIt was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States Senators who built their reputations and careers on the segregation of race in this country.

The latest in a long line of staffers to go is deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh, to take a position at the Defense Department. The problem is not a new one. Back in December, as many as four staff members in Harris\u2019 office announced they were leaving at the same time. This followed a CNN report on troubles then in the VP\u2019s office. The atmosphere in Harris\u2019 office was described as \u201ctense\u201d and \u201cdour.\u201d Some staff described situations where ideas might be brought up but were either dismissed or ignored. Many said that Harris does not take responsibility for important issues and blames staff when problems arise. KAMALA HARRIS: \"The significance of the passage of time, right?

        "text": "By The Center Square  March 22, 2022 at 10:08am By Casey Harper (The Center Square) Mortgage rates surpassed 4% for the first time since 2019 and the Federal Reserve announced a series of new rate hikes this week, two major shifts that mark the economic response to months of elevated inflation. The Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% interest rate hike and said six more increases are on the way. Last week\u2019s increase is meant to rein in inflation, but can have negative effects on economic growth. Meanwhile, mortgage rates are expected to increase along with the Federal Reserve rate. RELATED: Bloomberg Lectures Americans On Inflation: Eat Lentils, Take The Bus, And Let Your Pets Die \u201cThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong,\u201d the Federal Reserve said in its rate hike announcement. \u201cIn support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.\u201d The Federal Reserve justified the hike by saying the job market had reached a sufficient level. \u201cIndicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen,\u201d the Federal Reserve said. \u201cJob gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.\u201d Those mortgage rates will make it harder for Americans to afford homes, even as house prices soar.  \u201cHousing sales slip over 7% in February,\u201d said Elizabeth Kreiselmaier, one of many Republican Congressional candidates running on economic problems, which are expected to help hand Republicans hefty wins in November. Congressional Republicans currently hold a double digit lead on the generic ballot against Democrats. \u201cMortgage rates are on the rise, as household savings are reduced by inflation, making it more difficult for first time buyers,\u201d Kreiselmaier said. \u201cThis is the direct result of failed Biden/Kilmer economic policies.\u201d Critics say the latest federal spending spree of several trillion dollars, led by President Joe Biden, is to blame. \u201cThis is the epitome of how big government policies go awry and hurt the little guy,\u201d said Jonathan Williams, the chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council. \u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s trillion-dollar spending increases are directly responsible for inflation and thus the rising mortgage interest rates which are making it harder for hard-working Americans to buy a home. \u201cThe Federal Reserve raises interest rates in an attempt to bring down the high inflation, which is the product of the federal government\u2019s overspending,\u201d he added. \u201cAnytime Congress essentially prints money it leads to inflation.\u201d RELATED: Conservative Firebrand Dinesh D\u2019Souza Rips Biden Voters \u2013 \u2018Happy\u2019 About Karma Coming Their Way Williams said correcting federal spending is the long-term solution. \u201cFor everyone who liked their so-called free government money over the past two years, this is the result: inflation, and now, higher interest rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThe policy solution is for the federal government to adopt a meaningful balanced budget amendment, just as 49 of our 50 states have already done. If designed correctly, this would prevent the federal government from overspending, which inevitably leads to a disastrous cycle of inflation and high interest rates. We need our policymakers in Washington to look to the states, the laboratories of democracy, for policy solutions that work for everyday Americans.\u201d Syndicated with permission from The Center Square.

And the same is happening over who is to blame for the nation\u2019s skyrocketing gas prices. Democrats have gone to great lengths to portray the gas price hikes as \u201cPutin\u2019s price hike,\u201d but gas has been steadily increasing since Biden became President.\u00a0 Biden has also begun to accuse oil companies of \u201cpadding their profits.\u201d But what Joe Biden will not tell you is that in the 2022 fiscal budget, there are at least a dozen new tax increases on American energy companies. It is not hard to figure out that those taxes get passed on to consumers. While Energy Secretary Pete Buttigieg tells everyone who can\u2019t afford gas to buy a $45,000+ Tesla, the current average gas price in the nation is $4.25.

        "text": "By RealClearWire  March 21, 2022 at 1:55pm By Melissa Melendez for RealClearPolicy Ford Motor Company is an iconic American brand that gave us the original Model-T, the classic Thunderbird, the groundbreaking Shelby GT 350, and, of course, the revered Mustang. The story of Ford is really the story of America told in microcosm: an ever-unfolding saga of overcoming struggle with grit; progress through innovation; and the bold and sometimes daunting belief in bringing to life what is possible but not yet is \u2013 all thanks to the potent combination of American ingenuity and unrelenting perseverance. Unfortunately for Ford, those days seem to be far in the rearview mirror. And Americans have California governor Gavin Newsom to thank for it. RELATED: Bloomberg Lectures Americans On Inflation: Eat Lentils, Take The Bus, And Let Your Pets Die Earlier this year, Gov. Newsom toured Ford\u2019s Greenfield Labs research facility in Silicon Valley. He was there to tout a nearly $2 billion investment of California taxpayer dollars in cleaner and more cost-effective transportation as a component of the Golden State\u2019s aggressive emissions and climate agenda. Critical to his policy prescriptions are a swift shift to no-emission vehicles, including for Ford, whose gas-guzzling F-150 remains the\u00a0most popular pickup truck in America. Of course, Gov. Newsom wasn\u2019t in Palo Alto that day to tout the F-150; his visit was focused on the news Ford Mustang Mach-E, which, unlike its fuel-injected predecessor, is a 100% zero-emission electric vehicle (EV). It represents the future of the automotive sector globally \u2013 unsurprisingly, China currently dominates the market \u2013 and could be a major economic and environmental opportunity for the United States.  At this point, you may be wondering where the problem is, and you\u2019d be forgiven for not knowing. What Gov. Newsom didn\u2019t mention during his taxpayer-funded trip to Palo Alto was that the entirety of Ford\u2019s global production run of Mustang Mach-Es are made not in California \u2013 or even in America \u2013 but, rather, in Mexico. This type of chicanery is old hat for the governor. Instead of going to Palo Alto to celebrate an announcement of the Mustang Mach-Es as part of a bold climate and economic vision that will benefit Californians with increased in-state investment and good, hardworking jobs, this $2 billion project, funded by California taxpayers, will see its most tangible benefits go south of the border. This is not lost on the Mexican business and political community. On March 2, an\u00a0editorial\u00a0appeared in Mexican newspaper\u00a0Mexico Now. The author,\u00a0Julio Di-Bella Rold\u00e1n, vice president of public relations for the\u00a0El Gran Baj\u00edo regional chamber of commerce, noted the significant financial outlays made by Ford into the country and the obvious resulting benefits: \u201cThese U.S. capital investments in facility upgrades, skills training, and new job opportunities will benefit all of Mexico, helping sustain the recovery of millions of Mexican jobs lost during the pandemic and imparting vast economic benefits well beyond a single factory.\u201d Rold\u00e1n also refers to this as an \u201cincreasingly familiar story,\u201d raising the obvious question about what our leaders here at home are doing to protect American jobs and support a green, American manufacturing vision for the future, with EVs aplenty. RELATED: Conservative Firebrand Dinesh D\u2019Souza Rips Biden Voters \u2013 \u2018Happy\u2019 About Karma Coming Their Way Plainly speaking, the governor\u2019s event did nothing more than give Ford credit for its investment in EV technology with merely the appearance that the state would reap some direct benefit. Instead, jobs that should be going to hard-working Californians, and Ford\u2019s capital investments in a greener and cleaner future, have ended up in Mexico. This makes the United States less globally competitive, especially with China, and, frankly, less green. Men like Henry Ford built America. His story is our story; as Americans, we all share in his legacy of hard work and stick-to-itiveness that gave us the foundations of American enterprise. By contrast, the governor was satisfied with what amounts to a very expensive photo op \u2013 all while consigning the possibilities of a vibrant, green, American-engineered economic future to a foreign country. That\u2019s a legacy I know most Californians \u2013 and most Americans \u2013 would rather not embrace. Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.

        "text": "By RealClearWire  March 21, 2022 at 12:59pm By Adam Andrzejewski for RealClearPolicy High-powered political consulting firm SKDK improperly received a $35 million contract to encourage people to vote in California in 2020 while one of the founders of the firm was advising Joe Biden\u2019s campaign. The then-California Secretary of State Alex Padilla awarded the contract to SKDK, known for working with Democratic candidates and whose co-founder Anita Dunn works closely with Biden. The $35 million\u00a0was part of a $400 million Help America Vote Act (HAVA)\u00a02020 CARES Act Grant Fund. But California Controller Betty Yee said Padilla didn\u2019t have the authority to award the funds, only the counties did, and she\u00a0refused to pay the invoices. Later, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state legislature got SKDK its money\u00a0directly from the state budget. Besides Padilla not having authority to allocate the funds, the $35 million wasn\u2019t supposed to be used for get-out-the-vote efforts. RELATED: New Bills Would Expose Russian, Chinese Funding Of American Groups  HAVA\u00a0gives emergency funds to states to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus for the 2020 federal election cycle. It was not to encourage people to vote. In addition, Padilla awarded the contract to SKDK without following the state\u2019s competitive bidding process, another firm alleged. Mercury,\u00a0one of the seven firms that bid on the contract, said SKDK was allowed to submit 49 pages, far beyond the 15-page limit that other firms were held to, and was awarded the contract in an expedited manner. This was all going on while Anita Dunn was working for Biden\u2019s campaign. Her firm received $35 million \u2014 improperly from several angles \u2014 to encourage voters to cast ballots. She later joined the Biden White House as advisor and\u00a0refused to fill out ethics forms. Three Congress members, Reps. James Comer (R-Ky.), Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) and Jody Hice (R-Ga.), wrote several letters: first to Padilla, then to one inspector general of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, then to that IG\u2019s successor, as well as to a commissioner of the commission, highlighting how the $35 million was illegally spent. But all their letters have been met with radio silence. No investigation, no questions asked. With such a blatant conflict of interest being allowed, it\u2019s no wonder Americans don\u2019t trust the fairness of our elections. Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.

Schiff, like many who supported Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy leading up to the election, told the American people not to believe reports regarding Hunter\u2019s laptop. \u201cWe know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s been clear for well over a year now that they\u2019ve been pushing this false narrative about the vice president and his son.\u201d \u201cThis whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin,\u201d says House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, reacting to the FBI leading an investigation into whether unverified emails about Hunter Biden are tied to a Russian disinformation effort targeting his father\u2019s campaign. pic.twitter.com/DMSaw5MdSf \u2014 The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) October 16, 2020  Schiff doubled down in the same interview: \u201cClearly, the origins of this whole smear are from the Kremlin, and the president [Trump] is only too happy to have Kremlin help and try to amplify it.\u201d McCarthy said Schiff is only motivated by politics. \u201cThe worst part of it is, you cannot trust what he tells you, that he lies to us,\u201d said McCarthy.\u00a0 \u201cTwo years ago, Schiff stated the emails found from Hunter Biden were all a whole smear on Joe Biden that comes from the Kremlin. That\u2019s what the head of the Intel said,\u201d McCarthy explained. \u201cAdam Schiff lied to us one more time.\u201d Adam Schiff lied. About Russian collusion. About meeting with the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d And about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop. Why is Speaker Pelosi still allowing him to be on the Intelligence Committee? \u2014 Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) March 20, 2022  RELATED: McCarthy May Give Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar \u2018Better\u2019 Committee Assignments If GOP Takes Back Congress This isn\u2019t the first time McCarthy has vowed to remove Adam Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee, though the Hunter Biden laptop episode adds more fuel to the fire. Earlier this year, the Republican leader said he plans to remove Schiff and fellow Democrat Representatives Ilhan Omar and Eric Swalwell from their committee assignments should the GOP win back the House in 2022. POLL: Should Adam Schiff be kicked off the Intelligence Committee? He noted that Swalwell (CA) cannot get a security clearance in the private sector and should therefore not be serving on any committees, a reference to the Democrat\u2019s alleged relationship with a Chinese spy. Tucker Carlson says that \u201cU.S. Intelligence officials believe\u201d that a suspected Chinese spy \u201chad a sexual relationship with\u201d Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell (CA) and that Swalwell\u2019s office couldn\u2019t comment on it because they said that info might be \u201cclassified\u201dpic.twitter.com/biV78uVZHB \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) December 9, 2020  McCarthy also hinted at Omar\u2019s (D-MN) ouster in the same interview. \u201cIlhan Omar should not be serving on Foreign Affairs,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThis is a new level of what the Democrats have done.\u201d Adam Schiff\u2019s office said it would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d if Republicans take the House in 2022 and remove him from the intelligence committee, as Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Breitbart News he would do in an exclusive interview. https://t.co/fagwsPPs1U \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 10, 2022  McCarthy has also insisted that Republicans who have been removed from their committee assignments by Democrats for political reasons over controversial comments will be restored to committees, perhaps even finding themselves in better roles. \u201cThey\u2019ll have committees,\u201d McCarthy vowed of Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ). \u201cThey may have other committee assignments.\u201d In fact, he added, \u201cThey may have better committee assignments.\u201d Greene was removed from the Education and Labor Committee as well as the Budget Committee for ill-advised social media posts made prior\u00a0to her election to office. Gosar was removed from the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Natural Resources Committee after posting a parody cartoon video.

But most people are not capitalists, because they don\u2019t have capitalist money.

Do you think that fossil fuel CEOs should decide whether the planet gets set on fire?\u201d \u201cMe neither,\u201d AOC added. Apparently this is her idea of \u201ctalking about policies.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s whispering video appeared to be part of Q&A session on her Instagram story.

Fauci Returns To Warn Of New COVID Variant And Possible Surge Stephanopoulos asked Fauci about the latest variant of COVID-19, called BA.2.  Fauci replied, \u201cWell, as was said, it has this degree of transmission advantage over the original Omicron but not a multifold advantage, so it\u2019s about 50 to 60 percent or so more transmissible, which means, ultimately, over time, it might take over as the dominant variant.\u201d \u201cHowever, when you look at the cases they do not appear to be any more severe and they do not appear to evade immune responses, either from vaccines or prior infections,\u201d Fauci continued. \u201cSo the bottom line is we likely will see an uptick in cases as we\u2019ve seen in the European countries, particularly the U.K. where they\u2019ve had the same situation as we\u2019ve had now; they have the BA2, they have a relaxation of some of the restrictions such as indoor masking and there\u2019s a waning of immunity.\u201d Fauci went on, \u201cHopefully we won\u2019t see a surge; I don\u2019t think we will. The easiest way to prevent that is to continue to get people vaccinated and for those who have been vaccinated to continue to get them boosted. So that\u2019s where we stand right now; we can expect to see an increase, yes.\u201d Stephanopoulos then asked about possibly implementing more restrictions. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this relaxation of restrictions all across the country right now. Any reason to reverse that?\u201d Stephanopoulos asked the doctor. \u201cI don\u2019t think so George, not right now,\u201d Fauci answered. \u201cI don\u2019t see us going back into any more really very strict of restrictions.\u201d BUT\u2026 Fauci continued, \u201cBut you always have to have the kind of flexibility: Remember when the CDC came out with the kind of modifications of their metrics which would lead to the guidelines of what regions or counties in the country should have a masking indoor? They made it very clear that as you pull back on restrictions, if we do see a significant surge, particularly one that might result in an increase in hospitalizations, we have to be prepared to pivot and perhaps reinstitute some of those restrictions.\u201d BREAKING: Fauci says it may be \u201cnecessary\u201d to \u201cre-institute\u201d COVID-19 restrictions to stop an additional surge, such as forced masking.

However, Bolling didn\u2019t let her slide. \"Let\u2019s not throw stones in glass houses, shall we not, Joy?\"@ericbolling asked where @JoyAnnReid's \"coverage of Yemen\" was after the @MSNBC host complained about the racial \"disparity\" regarding war reporting. https://t.co/yWu6GIOaS7 \u2014 Mediaite (@Mediaite) March 18, 2022  RELATED: Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky Ominously Claims World War III \u2018May Have Already Started\u2019 On Monday, Reid whined about what she perceived, as she always does, as some sort of racial \u201cdisparity\u201d over war coverage in Ukraine versus other parts of the world: \u201cNow, what we\u2019re seeing in Ukraine is absolutely the worst humanitarian crisis that Europe has seen in decades, but we haven\u2019t witnessed the same type of solidarity for the Yemenis as we do for the Ukrainians. We don\u2019t see historic sanctions or global campaigns, corporations like Airbnb and Netflix taking a stand.\u201d But Reid was just warming up for what her true accusation against western media was. \u201cAnd this is not to say we shouldn\u2019t care this much for Ukraine \u2013 far from it. The point is, we should also care this much for refugees in those facing occupation and war in the Middle East, and Asia and Africa too. The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to Western media compared to their browner and blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war.\u201d  Surely with such a complaint, Reid \u2013 as part of the media, with a daily primetime national TV show \u2013 would regularly cover the war in Yemen, right?\u00a0 Wrong!

She\u2019s had days and days to cover more of the wars and famines in the rest of the world.\u201d Bolling then summed up Joy Reid\u2019s entire agenda, not just her implication that the world does not care about clashes in countries that are non-white, but her agenda in general saying, \u201cWhen you find yourself making a judgment on a situation based on the color of a person\u2019s skin, you might find that perhaps you are the one being racist.\u201d JOY REID A GRAND WIZARD!

The meme, which he credits to another creator, shows the crying Rittenhouse seemingly at a gas pump and weeping over the sky-high gas prices. It is an amusing effort that actually pokes fun at himself and points out the absurdity of the Biden gas price hikes.

Mary Trump, the niece of former President Donald Trump, responded to the crying meme with a post that should get attention for the slate of libel lawsuits Rittenhouse is rumored to be pursuing. \u201cIf I killed another human being \u2013 even if it was an accident or I believed it was in self-defense \u2013 my life would be destroyed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis sociopath just revealed himself to be the murderer most of us already know he is.\u201d If I killed another human being\u2013even if it was an accident or I believed it was in self-defense\u2013my life would be destroyed.

What was frightening was that three men, some with serious criminal backgrounds, were almost able to kill a teenager during a serious riot. But he thankfully was able to defend himself. What\u2019s frightening is that the left and the media then characterized Rittenhouse as a murderer and he was almost jailed for life over that false narrative when he was put on trial this past November. What\u2019s frightening is that they continue to lie about what happened. The latest meme from Kyle Rittenhouse is precisely why in the \u2066@NYTmag\u2069 roundtable I described the reaction to this child killing two ppl as one of the most alarming & frightening episodes of the past few years.They want to make remorseless children.https://t.co/YxLt9NIItq pic.twitter.com/NGHeeH3LRj \u2014 Sherrilyn Ifill (@Sifill_LDF) March 18, 2022  \u201cThe Kyle Rittenhouse video is a cry for a \u2018Dancing With The Stars\u2019 slot,\u201d tweeted comedian Paula Poundstone.

Rittenhouse criticized LeBron James for mocking his crying episode in court during a podcast interview in December. \u201cI was a Lakers fan too before he said that,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really pissed off when he said that because I liked LeBron, and then I\u2019m like, you know what, f*ck you, LeBron.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, there were a lot of Laker fans that stopped watching once LeBron James joined the team.

As the\u00a0Political Insider wrote, the New York Times on Thursday published a story on Hunter Biden\u2019s tax bill and the federal investigation into his business dealings which \u201cauthenticated\u201d emails from his infamous laptop. Prior to the election and even many months later, the mainstream media refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of Hunter\u2019s laptop. By contrast, the Steele dossier and its salacious allegations against former President Trump has since been labeled by Axios as an \u201cepic fail\u201d by the media and led to the Washington Post quietly editing their past reports on it after a second key player in the dossier\u2019s \u2018research\u2019 had been\u00a0arrested. Levine\u2019s thread is a solid visual representation of the media\u2019s exuberance in reporting on an unverified dossier that would negatively reflect on Trump, and their utter lack of curiosity in reporting on the existence of a laptop that would negatively reflect on Biden.

        "text": "By The Center Square  March 18, 2022 at 11:33am By Casey Harper (The Center Square) Newly introduced legislation would require think tanks and nonprofits to reveal whether they have significant funding from governments and political groups in Russia and China. U.S. Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, introduced the \u201cThink Tank and Nonprofit Foreign Influence Disclosure Act\u201d Thursday, which would require nonprofits and think tanks to disclose foreign donations over $50,000. The bill would require the U.S. Treasury Department to create a \u201cpublicly available in a searchable database information relating to such gifts and contributions received from foreign governments and political parties\u2026\u201d RELATED: Now That the NYT Has Granted Legitimacy To Hunter\u2019s Laptop, Will It Stop Being A Biden Lapdog? \u201cForeign governments and foreign political parties attempt to influence the government and political system of the United States through donations to nonprofit charitable organizations especially think tanks and cultural organizations,\u201d the bill reads. \u201cWhile institutions of higher learning are required to disclose foreign gifts to the Department of Education pursuant to the Higher Education Act, no such requirement exists for think tanks.\u201d Gooden sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen earlier this month alleging that Russian-funded environmental groups are advocating against U.S. oil production in the name of climate change with the real motive of strengthening their own economy, which relies heavily on exporting oil. \u201cNumerous reports have confirmed Russia\u2019s extensive efforts to interfere in our government, perpetrated through environmental groups such as these, who take shelter behind their non-profit status and donor anonymity,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe are now experiencing the results of unchecked foreign interference to manipulate Americans\u2019 opinions about pipelines, fossil fuels, fracking, and climate change. The Treasury Department has a responsibility to the American people to shed light on the growing role environmental nonprofit organizations have in undermining our national security and American energy independence.\u201d The new legislation points to a 2019 report from the Center for a New American Security, which said: \u201cA number of U.S. universities, academic departments, individual scholars, think tanks, and other civil society organizations receive substantial funding from Beijing that is often targeted at shaping views and discourse on China.\u201d  Funding for those academic institutions suggests it could be more widespread. \u201cHigher degrees of transparency can help to ensure that this funding is not generating hidden forms of foreign lobbying, self-censorship, or other activities that undermine core U.S. democratic principles,\u201d the report said. \u201cTo that end, the U.S. government should significantly lower the funding cap that triggers a requirement for U.S. institutions to disclose these foreign contributions. Concurrently, Congress should also expand the reach of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to require universities to set standards and limits for student organizations and cultural exchange institutions that rely on external, especially foreign government, sources of funding.\u201d RELATED: Over A Third Of Americans Are Willing To Risk Nuclear War With Russia: Poll The Republican Study Committee released a report in June pointing out the same issue. \u201cAlthough universities are required to report foreign gifts above $250,000 as part of the Higher Education Act, this requirement does not currently exist for think tanks and other nonprofit organizations that may operate under the pretext of educational activities,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe Task Force therefore believes that think tanks and similar nonprofit institutions receiving significant funding, over $50,000 a year, from foreign governments, foreign political parties or foreign military entities, should be required to disclose that information for purposes of identifying conflicts of-interest. However, such disclosures should not be mandated for funding below $50,000 a year, or from bona fide non-government entities, so as not to create overly burdensome requirements or hamper legitimate non-government apolitical foreign research funding.\u201d China has been notorious for influencing American intellectual spheres through funding. Several leading universities, including Harvard, the University of Southern California, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and New York University, have received tens of millions of dollars from Chinese donors. \u201cA number of think tanks and cultural organizations incorporated in the United States have received money from the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party \u2013 an organization based on conducting political warfare against enemies of the Chinese Communist Party and undermining democracy around the world,\u201d the bill said. Critics of Gooden\u2019s plan have rebuffed the accusation of foreign funding tainting their mission. Gooden, though, has pushed for transparency, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought attention to the issue. \u201cPresident Biden is beholden to a cabal of radical environmentalists who are actively working to undermine our national security,\u201d Gooden said. \u201cNancy Pelosi and Joe Biden must put our national security ahead of their Green New Deal agenda and investigate these organizations and their ties to Russia.\u201d\u00a0 Syndicated with permission from The Center Square.

In the 24th paragraph of an article detailing the Department of Justice\u2019s ongoing probe into Hunter Biden\u2019s finances, the\u00a0New York Times finally acknowledges the authenticity of material\u00a0on the infamous laptop the president\u2019s son abandoned in a Delaware repair shop. The key passage reads: Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a\u00a0laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation. This, of course, is the same laptop \u2013 filled with explosive allegations of sketchy deals with foreign governments and suggestions of payoffs to Joe Biden \u2013 that the Times and other mainstream outlets ignored or dismissed as \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d after the New York Post first reported on it in October 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Twitter and Facebook\u00a0banned the Post from sharing its reporting. As the Post reported today: In the heat of the presidential race of 2020, the Times never missed a chance to cast doubt on the laptop, saying the information was \u2018purported\u2019 and quoting a letter from former Democratic officials who claimed \u2014 with no evidence \u2014 that it was Russian disinformation. As recently as September 2021, the Times called the laptop \u2018unsubstantiated\u2019 in a news story. RELATED: Now Psaki Doesn\u2019t Want To Answer Questions About Her Past Claims That Hunter Biden\u2019s Laptop Was \u2018Russian Disinformation\u2019 Of course anyone with a pulse knew the laptop was real. While then-candidate Joe Biden trotted out the \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d narrative, his dissolute son Hunter never denied the possibility that the laptop belonged to him. In addition, a former business partner of the Bidens,\u00a0Tony Bobulinski, came forward at the time to both debunk Joe Biden\u2019s lie that he never discussed foreign business with his son and to claim that Joe was getting a cut of the profits.  The damage of this disinformation campaign orchestrated by Democrats and their media allies is incalculable. Given Biden\u2019s razor-thin margins in several swing states, it is worth asking if he would have been elected president had these allegations of corruption received a full and fair airing. One poll by a conservative outfit found that\u00a017 percent of Biden supporters\u00a0said they might have changed their vote. Now that the Times has deigned to confer legitimacy on the laptop, the big question is whether it will pursue its leads. The place to start would be the 2017 email regarding a deal with Chinese energy executives that states, \u201c10 held by H for the big guy?\u201d We know H is Hunter and Bobulinksi has said that\u00a0Joe was commonly referred to as the \u201cbig guy.\u201d Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.

In responding to Holt\u2019s question, Zelensky contended that \u201cnobody knows\u201d whether World War III\u00a0 \u201cmay have already started.\u201d\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s president told Holt through a translator, \u201cWell, nobody knows whether it may have already started and what is the possibility of this war if Ukraine will fall, in case Ukraine will fall. It\u2019s very hard to say, and we\u2019ve seen this 80 years ago when the Second World War had started, and there were similar tragedies in history.\u201d  Zelenksy noted that he believes few can predict when a \u201cfull-scale\u201d world war might begin. \u201cNobody would be able to predict when the full-scale war would start and how it will end and how Putin ends to that. In any case, the war tends to end up in millions of people lost, people die, millions of buildings destroyed,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cNow we have different technologies, nuclear weapons; in this case, we have the whole civilization at stake.\u201d The Ukrainian leader said he had faith in the strength of his people and that they would triumph in the end. \u201cThis is what our people have clearly demonstrated,\u201d Zelensky observed. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa \"If World War III starts, it won't start in Ukraine,\" Biden. #Ukraine #Zelensky #Russian pic.twitter.com/OSpbLyBfWv \u2014 Cumali (@porcumali) March 11, 2022  RELATED: Zelensky: Ukraine \u2018Must Admit\u2019 It Won\u2019t Join NATO.

        "text": "By RealClearWire  March 17, 2022 at 2:19pm By Michael Ryan for RealClearEducation A Kansas school district is accused of suspending and reprimanding a teacher for \u201cdiscrimination and harassment\u201d after she refused to use a student\u2019s preferred first name and gender pronouns. The teacher also was denied a religious exemption to the district\u2019s required practice. The allegation comes in a federal lawsuit filed Monday against USD 475 Geary County School District and the principal of Fort Riley Middle School in Fort Riley. It is filed on behalf of Pamela Ricard, a \u201cdecades-long\u201d teacher assigned to the school since 2005. RELATED: Virginia School Board Meeting Goes Off The Rails After New \u2018Equity\u2019 Policy Is Ruled Discriminatory (VIDEO) Ricard was reprimanded and suspended three days in April 2021 \u201cfor addressing a biologically female student by the student\u2019s legal and enrolled last name,\u201d according to the lawsuit, in an apparent attempt to avoid using the student\u2019s preferred first name. That name is not disclosed in the court filing, but a classmate has said the student preferred \u201che/him\u201d pronouns. The lawsuit says Ricard is a devout Christian who believes gender is assigned by God at conception, and that \u201cany policy that requires Ms. Ricard to refer to a student by a gendered, non-binary, or plural pronoun \u2026 or other gendered language that is different from the student\u2019s biological sex actively violates Ms. Ricard\u2019s religious beliefs.\u201d Ricard requested a religious accommodation three times during an appeal of her discipline. In a closed meeting last August with the Board of Education, Ricard explained that her addressing the student as \u201cMiss (last name)\u201d was intended to be respectful while also protecting Ricard\u2019s religious beliefs. When the board later denied her appeal without a public vote, the Kansas Attorney General\u2019s office warned the district that it had violated the Kansas Open Meetings Act. The board then denied Ricard\u2019s appeal in a public vote at its September meeting.  The district never did offer a possible accommodation of Ricard\u2019s religious beliefs, the suit says. Instead, the board voted at the September meeting to approve a policy mandating the use of student-preferred names and pronouns. At the time of Ricard\u2019s discipline last spring, the district didn\u2019t have such a formal policy. According to the lawsuit, the district and school \u201cnow threaten to punish Ms. Ricard again if she continues to refrain from using a student\u2019s preferred pronouns, express her views through silence or neutral language, or even engage in a neutral policy of referring to students by their enrolled last names or with other gender-neutral language. Under district policies, all teachers must now refer to each student \u2013 both in and out of class \u2013 using whatever names or pronouns the student claims reflect his or her particular gender identity on any given day.\u201d A school counselor had informed Ricard by email of the student\u2019s new preferred name, though the lawsuit says the email continued to address the student as \u201cshe.\u201d That spring, the suit says, school administrators had sent teachers a directive to use students\u2019 preferred names. In addition, a week after Ricard\u2019s three-day suspension and reprimand last April, the lawsuit says, the principal sent teachers \u201ctraining documents on diversity training on gender identity and gender expression,\u201d as well as protocols on the use of preferred names and pronouns. The lawsuit says teachers were told in the training documents that failure to use students\u2019 preferred names and pronouns \u201cwould constitute a discriminatory act subject to employee discipline\u201d and would be a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

        "text": "By RealClearWire  March 17, 2022 at 12:57pm By Philip Wegmann for RealClearPolitics At the beginning of the pandemic, the previous president had a vision \u2013 one his scientific advisors urged him to abandon. Not only did Donald Trump want the economy back open, he said that by Easter Sunday of 2020, \u201cyou will have packed churches all over the country.\u201d It never happened, at least not on the scale he envisioned. Two years later, after millions of vaccines have been administered and the virus has receded from its peak, things look very different. A sign of the times: After two years, the White House plans to resume regular public tours. Doors are scheduled to open on Good Friday. As Biden officials smile about the poetry of that rhyming calendar, the White House is dealing with a political paradox: How to secure more COVID aid from Congress as the administration pivots away from the pandemic. It\u2019s proving to be a hard sell. RELATED: Comptroller\u2019s Audit Finds Former NY Governor Andrew Cuomo \u2018Misled The Public\u2019 On Nursing Home Deaths The same morning the White House announced a return to business as usual for tourists, the administration raised the alarm about a virus they believe is on the run. Cases are down 95% since the peak of the omicron variant. Hospitalizations have similarly plunged by 85%. More than 215 million Americans are already fully vaccinated. Yet officials warned on a call with reporters Tuesday morning that their pandemic coffers could soon be empty. \u201cFor months, we\u2019ve made clear to Congress, on a bipartisan basis, that the funding for tests, treatments, and vaccines was drying up and that additional funds would be needed,\u201d the official said. How much money do they need? The number administration officials floated was $22.5 billion. And if they don\u2019t get it? White House budgeteers will make trims to the request. They warn, however, that the U.S. won\u2019t have enough boosters or variant-specific vaccines \u201cfor all Americans,\u201d according to a fact sheet provided by the administration.  They won\u2019t be able to buy monoclonal antibody treatments, either, and the current supply is expected to run out as soon as May. Without a cash infusion, they predict that the testing capacity will collapse. Governors were warned late Tuesday morning that the administration would be reducing the number of monoclonal antibody treatments by 30% within a week. Republicans say they aren\u2019t necessarily opposed to more COVID spending. They just want to know where all the other COVID cash went first, as\u00a0Sen. Richard Shelby explained to Politico. \u201cThere\u2019s a doubt that they need this money with a lot of us,\u201d explained the Alabama Republican. \u201cI\u2019ve said this for weeks, a real accounting of the money [already spent on COVID] that the American people deserve and then go from there. If there\u2019s no money left, and it\u2019s not hidden somewhere, and if they show a need, then you got, maybe, a persuasive case.\u201d Asked if the White House would negotiate for a lower number, a Biden official gave an emphatic \u201cno.\u201d And when then asked if they would accept using different funds for their COVID priorities, the official demurred, saying only that \u201cthe money they provided over a year ago has been well spent, but we defer to Congress on the specific legislative approach.\u201d It is a routine kind of squabble, albeit one that comes at the tail end of a once-in-a-century pandemic. The difficulty for Biden may be that the public is moving on after he pivoted away from the virus during his State of the Union address. Masks are increasingly uncommon these days.\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci has receded\u00a0from the cable news circuit. News of a land war in Europe now eclipses COVID coverage. RELATED: Rand Paul Proposes Amendment To Eliminate Fauci\u2019s Government Position Entirely White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told RealClearPolitics that COVID funding was a necessity, despite the public\u2019s shifting attention. \u201cWe\u2019re in a different stage and we have a range of tools in order to fight the pandemic,\u201d she explained, adding that in order to keep up that fight, \u201cWe need money.\u201d A new subvariant of the virus, BA2 omicron, has already made it to American shores. It is apparently even more transmissible than the original Omicron strain, Psaki noted, but also treatable. \u201cWe need to have masks, tests, boosters, treatments for [the] immunocompromised in order to continue to treat the American people during a pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it remains urgent.\u201d That urgency was underscored by breaking news Tuesday evening. At least nine Democrats had already tested positive for the virus\u00a0after those lawmakers attended a party retreat\u00a0last week in Philadelphia. The president was also at the event, but he tested negative Sunday night, Psaki told reporters. Then, Kamala Harris\u2019 husband Doug Emhoff tested positive. The vice president had stood shoulder to shoulder with Biden earlier in the day at an indoor event, and she was expected to share the stage with the president at an event in the East Room of the White House to celebrate \u201cEqual Pay Day.\u201d The room was packed front to back, but Harris wasn\u2019t there. \u201cEarlier today, the Second Gentleman tested positive for COVID-19. Out of an abundance of caution, the Vice President will not participate in tonight\u2019s event,\u201d the White House announced just moments before Biden entered the room. \u201cThe Vice President tested negative for COVID-19 today and will continue to test.\u201d The president shrugged off the news like it was routine. \u201cWelcome to the White House,\u201d Biden told the crowd that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and numerous members of his cabinet. \u201cThis is the biggest crowd we\u2019ve had since we got here.\u201d Only later, after a gaffe where he mistakenly said that \u201cthe first lady\u2019s husband contracted COVID,\u201d did Biden ask the mostly unmasked crowd to send to Harris \u201cour love.\u201d Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.

        "text": "By RealClearWire  March 17, 2022 at 12:48pm By Susan Crabtree for RealClearPolitics At a time of tectonic shifts in foreign policy alliances, with Russia and China forming a new pact and aggressively asserting themselves on the international stage, Washington\u2019s national security community is splintered across the ideological spectrum on how best to counter the dual threats. Yet, even before Russia invaded Ukraine, a group of national security practitioners, military veterans, and scholars began trying to move beyond their policy differences to help repair the damage inflicted by the last U.S. foreign policy failure \u2013 the chaotic U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan nearly seven months ago. When the\u00a0Vandenberg Coalition, a group of primarily Republican experts representing diverse foreign policy views and approaches, began their Afghanistan assessment, its members couldn\u2019t have known that international alarm over Russia\u2019s bloody land grab would soon eclipse the U.S. evacuation of Afghanistan. RELATED: Will Russian Invasion Of Ukraine Embolden China? Some national security experts believe that the two U.S. foreign policy nightmares are inextricably linked \u2013 that America\u2019s ignominious retreat in Afghanistan emboldened Vladimir Putin to move on Ukraine. While the world shifts its focus to Europe and weighs Putin\u2019s intentions, Afghanistan remains a smoldering catastrophe with 22 million people, more than half of Afghanistan\u2019s population, in desperate need of humanitarian assistance and with new terrorist threats emerging. China and Russia are also eying new economic opportunities in the war-torn, landlocked country where feuding tribal elements have defied foreign occupiers throughout history With this in mind, the\u00a0Vandenberg Coalition\u2019s Afghanistan Working Group moved forward with releasing its planned report this week, a set of prescriptions its members believe will help restore American goals in the region and assist stalled international humanitarian relief efforts. One of the coalition\u2019s overarching U.S. goals in Afghanistan focuses on China\u2019s growing global influence on international display as Russia turns to Beijing for economic assistance. First reviewed by RealClearPolitics,\u00a0the report\u00a0argues that countering Sino inroads in Afghanistan is a critical U.S. national security interest, but that the U.S. should avoid trying to check Beijing\u2019s every move, because doing so could become a costly distraction to more crucial competition in the region.  \u201cChina is unlikely to cooperate in a process that erodes Taliban control in Afghanistan and will instead attempt to increase its influence and access in Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Pakistan,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe U.S. is best served by focusing on competing with China primarily in the Indo-Pacific while otherwise raising costs for Chinese cooperation with the Taliban.\u201d In \u201climited instances,\u201d the report asserts, U.S. and Chinese goals actually may align, especially when it comes to cracking down on terrorism safe havens in Afghanistan. If China follows through with its interest in the country\u2019s natural resources, it will have an incentive to keep militant activity to a minimum while balancing its efforts to strengthen Pakistan. Beijing has so far refrained from recognizing the Taliban as the legitimate government, but Chinese media have highlighted the economic opportunities the new Islamic leadership presents for Beijing, particularly for lithium mining. RELATED: Hunter Biden On List Of Americans Sanctioned By Russia Terrorist attacks, however, could disrupt mining activity. The Taliban has pledged not to allow foreign militants to regroup. Still, al-Qaeda, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and the Islamic State Khorasan, or ISK, and many others continue to reside in the country, according to the\u00a0first United Nations report on terrorism levels\u00a0in Afghanistan since the U.S. withdrawal, released in January. The report found that ISK is regrouping, carrying out attacks more frequently, with its membership in Afghanistan doubling since August. When it comes to relations with the Taliban itself, the report urges the Biden administration to continue to diplomatically isolate the group that seized power as U.S.-backed forces collapsed and not to recognize it as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. The coalition also stressed the importance of preventing the Taliban from gaining \u201cany access to or benefits from\u201d bilateral and multilateral assistance. However, the Vandenberg Afghanistan working group could not come to a consensus on whether the U.S. should maintain all of its current sanctions on the Taliban. Some group members advocate keeping U.S. and international sanctions in place and maintaining strict limits on the Taliban\u2019s use of funds held by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Others argued that aggressive sanctions would exacerbate the suffering of the Afghan people without destabilizing the Taliban. After Afghanistan fell to Taliban control, the Biden administration insisted that the U.S. would maintain \u201cover-the-horizon\u201d counter-terrorism capabilities \u2013 the ability to assess from afar the state of the terrorist threat emanating from the country. But the coalition believes more concrete steps are needed to enhance U.S. intelligence gathering. The report urges the Biden administration to expand cooperation with countries in the region, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan bilaterally and in conjunction with Turkey and Azerbaijan, to secure access for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance collection, as well as aerial strikes. The opposite is true for Pakistan, the report asserts, recommending that the U.S. avoid working with Islamabad as much as possible while bolstering relations with India. The U.S. should only engage with Pakistan\u2019s leaders to the \u201cminimal extent necessary to retain access to its airspace to conduct drone strikes in Afghanistan,\u201d the report stated. \u201cWith the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the United States has an opportunity to exert more diplomatic and economic pressure on Pakistan than in the past and raise the costs of its ongoing support for the Taliban.\u201d RELATED: Over A Third Of Americans Are Willing To Risk Nuclear War With Russia: Poll The Coalition also recommends that the U.S. restart non-lethal aid to the National Resistance Front, a military alliance of anti-Taliban Afghans who remain the only holdout group refusing to surrender to Taliban control. In trying to channel U.S. humanitarian assistance to the areas of greatest need, the coalition offers several recommendations, including a pointed policy difference with the Biden administration. The report urges Congress to pass legislation reversing a U.S. decision that would allow humanitarian non-governmental organizations to pay taxes or fees to the Haqqani network, long one of the most lethal and vicious factions of the Taliban. \u201cCongress should consider enacting legislation to reverse this action and free the status quo sanctions regime to ensure that the Biden administration cannot pursue similar policies moving forward,\u201d the report states. Other important top-line recommendations: \u201cBeyond the immediate issues of addressing the humanitarian crisis, the United States should ensure the United Nations, especially [that] the Security Council and other key international partners are working towards the restoration of a legitimate and Constitutional governmental order where the rights of all are respected, and political issues are settled at the ballot box and in parliamentary sessions rather than at the barrel of a gun,\u201d the report concluded. Because it\u2019s unlikely that the Taliban would willingly agree to elections, humanitarian access, and other threats to their hold on power, \u201cthe United States and others must be willing to deploy multilateral and bilateral coercive measures,\u201d the report said.

We understand that,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cWe are adequate people.\u201d The Ukrainian president continued, \u201cFor years, we have heard about the supposedly open door, but we have also heard that we should not enter, and this is true and we must admit it,\u201d he said of Ukraine\u2019s efforts to join NATO, which began in 2008.\u00a0 The Ukrainian President\u2019s admission also included a swipe at NATO \u2013 which was created in 1949 as a mutual defense agreement in opposition to the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact.  \u201cThe Russian invasion of Ukraine destroyed everything that security in our region \u2014 and I am sure international security \u2014 was based on,\u201d Zelensky said, \u201cthe weight of the organizations we all hoped for, the force of international conventions. It has also called into question the world\u2019s most powerful alliance, NATO.\u201d While Zelensky\u2019s statement was a much needed aspect of ending the current war in his country perpetrated by Russia, this declaration should have come sooner. As Ted Galen Carpenter observed in The Guardian at the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, \u201cVladimir Putin bears primary responsibility for this latest development, but Nato\u2019s arrogant, tone-deaf policy toward Russia over the past quarter-\u200bcentury deserves a large share as well.\u201d \u201cAnalysts committed to a US foreign policy of realism and restraint have warned for more than a quarter-\u200bcentury that continuing to expand the most powerful military alliance in history toward another major power would not end well,\u201d Galen Carpenter noted. \u201cThe war in Ukraine provides definitive confirmation that it did not.\u201d Many U.S. officials have warned against NATO enlargement for decades for exactly this reason. Former president Bill Clinton\u2019s secretary of state Madeline Albright wrote in her memoir, \u201c[Russian president Boris] Yeltsin and his countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement, seeing it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability and moving Europe\u2019s dividing line to the east, leaving them isolated.\u201d George Kennan, the famous Truman Cold Warrior who is credited with the \u201ccontainment\u201d doctrine of the Soviet Union, warned in a New York Times interview in May 1998 regarding NATO expansion, \u201cI think it is the beginning of a new cold war. I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies.\u201d \u201cI think it is a tragic mistake,\u201d Kennan forebode.\u00a0 Bob Gates, the Secretary of Defense under George W. Bush and Barack Obama, warned \u201ctrying to bring Georgia and Ukraine into Nato was truly overreaching\u201d. The notion was \u201crecklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their own vital national interests\u201d. Much of this history leading up to this point has been forgotten, or most likely simply ignored.\u00a0 As the LA Times points out,\u00a0 In early February 1990, U.S. leaders made the Soviets an offer. According to transcripts of meetings in Moscow on Feb. 9, then-Secretary of State James Baker suggested that in exchange for cooperation on Germany, U.S. could make \u201ciron-clad guarantees\u201d that NATO would not expand \u201cone inch eastward.\u201d Less than a week later, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to begin reunification talks. \"Expanding #NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire cold-war era.\" \u2013 George Kennan, 1997 \u2014 W R (@rylan7) March 16, 2022  So, while no excuses should be made for Putin, many saw this coming. Reasonable people can debate the pros and cons \u2013 but we should all be absolutely clear about the potential consequences.\u00a0 The \u201cit\u2019s not about NATO\u201d crowd must be very confused by Zelensky now saying Ukraine probably won\u2019t join NATO. Much is confusing if you just started paying attention to what\u2019s happening two weeks ago and you trust people like Michael McFaul. \u2014 Richard Hanania (@RichardHanania) March 15, 2022  RELATED: Biden Spokesman Snaps At Reporter Who Asks \u2018So That\u2019s It?\u2019 After Admin Fails To Condemn Mass Execution In Saudi Arabia Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.com is a professional writer and editor with over 15 years of experience in conservative media and Republican politics.
