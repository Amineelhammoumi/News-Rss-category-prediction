With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong,\u201d the Federal Reserve said in its rate hike announcement. \u201cIn support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.\u201dThe Federal Reserve justified the hike by saying the job market had reached a sufficient level.\u201cIndicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen,\u201d the Federal Reserve said. \u201cJob gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially.

And Americans have California governor Gavin Newsom to thank for it.RELATED: Bloomberg Lectures Americans On Inflation: Eat Lentils, Take The Bus, And Let Your Pets DieEarlier this year, Gov. Newsom toured Ford\u2019s Greenfield Labs research facility in Silicon Valley. He was there to tout a nearly $2 billion investment of California taxpayer dollars in cleaner and more cost-effective transportation as a component of the Golden State\u2019s aggressive emissions and climate agenda.Critical to his policy prescriptions are a swift shift to no-emission vehicles, including for Ford, whose gas-guzzling F-150 remains the\u00a0most popular pickup truck in America.Of course, Gov. Newsom wasn\u2019t in Palo Alto that day to tout the F-150; his visit was focused on the news Ford Mustang Mach-E, which, unlike its fuel-injected predecessor, is a 100% zero-emission electric vehicle (EV). It represents the future of the automotive sector globally \u2013 unsurprisingly, China currently dominates the market \u2013 and could be a major economic and environmental opportunity for the United States.At this point, you may be wondering where the problem is, and you\u2019d be forgiven for not knowing. What Gov. Newsom didn\u2019t mention during his taxpayer-funded trip to Palo Alto was that the entirety of Ford\u2019s global production run of Mustang Mach-Es are made not in California \u2013 or even in America \u2013 but, rather, in Mexico.This type of chicanery is old hat for the governor. Instead of going to Palo Alto to celebrate an announcement of the Mustang Mach-Es as part of a bold climate and economic vision that will benefit Californians with increased in-state investment and good, hardworking jobs, this $2 billion project, funded by California taxpayers, will see its most tangible benefits go south of the border.This is not lost on the Mexican business and political community. On March 2, an\u00a0editorial\u00a0appeared in Mexican newspaper\u00a0Mexico Now. The author,\u00a0Julio Di-Bella Rold\u00e1n, vice president of public relations for the\u00a0El Gran Baj\u00edo regional chamber of commerce, noted the significant financial outlays made by Ford into the country and the obvious resulting benefits: \u201cThese U.S. capital investments in facility upgrades, skills training, and new job opportunities will benefit all of Mexico, helping sustain the recovery of millions of Mexican jobs lost during the pandemic and imparting vast economic benefits well beyond a single factory.\u201dRold\u00e1n also refers to this as an \u201cincreasingly familiar story,\u201d raising the obvious question about what our leaders here at home are doing to protect American jobs and support a green, American manufacturing vision for the future, with EVs aplenty.RELATED: Conservative Firebrand Dinesh D\u2019Souza Rips Biden Voters \u2013 \u2018Happy\u2019 About Karma Coming Their WayPlainly speaking, the governor\u2019s event did nothing more than give Ford credit for its investment in EV technology with merely the appearance that the state would reap some direct benefit. Instead, jobs that should be going to hard-working Californians, and Ford\u2019s capital investments in a greener and cleaner future, have ended up in Mexico. This makes the United States less globally competitive, especially with China, and, frankly, less green.Men like Henry Ford built America. His story is our story; as Americans, we all share in his legacy of hard work and stick-to-itiveness that gave us the foundations of American enterprise.By contrast, the governor was satisfied with what amounts to a very expensive photo op \u2013 all while consigning the possibilities of a vibrant, green, American-engineered economic future to a foreign country. That\u2019s a legacy I know most Californians \u2013 and most Americans \u2013 would rather not embrace.Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.State Senator Melissa Melendez represents California\u2019s 28th\u00a0Senate district.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Political Insider.Don't let liberals in media silence conservatives.

Gavin Newsom and the state legislature got SKDK its money\u00a0directly from the state budget.Besides Padilla not having authority to allocate the funds, the $35 million wasn\u2019t supposed to be used for get-out-the-vote efforts.RELATED: New Bills Would Expose Russian, Chinese Funding Of American GroupsHAVA\u00a0gives emergency funds to states to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus for the 2020 federal election cycle. It was not to encourage people to vote.In addition, Padilla awarded the contract to SKDK without following the state\u2019s competitive bidding process, another firm alleged.Mercury,\u00a0one of the seven firms that bid on the contract, said SKDK was allowed to submit 49 pages, far beyond the 15-page limit that other firms were held to, and was awarded the contract in an expedited manner.This was all going on while Anita Dunn was working for Biden\u2019s campaign. Her firm received $35 million \u2014 improperly from several angles \u2014 to encourage voters to cast ballots.She later joined the Biden White House as advisor and\u00a0refused to fill out ethics forms.Three Congress members, Reps. James Comer (R-Ky.), Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) and Jody Hice (R-Ga.), wrote several letters: first to Padilla, then to one inspector general of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, then to that IG\u2019s successor, as well as to a commissioner of the commission, highlighting how the $35 million was illegally spent.But all their letters have been met with radio silence.

The easiest way to prevent that is to continue to get people vaccinated and for those who have been vaccinated to continue to get them boosted. So that\u2019s where we stand right now; we can expect to see an increase, yes.\u201dStephanopoulos then asked about possibly implementing more restrictions.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this relaxation of restrictions all across the country right now. Any reason to reverse that?\u201d Stephanopoulos asked the doctor.\u201cI don\u2019t think so George, not right now,\u201d Fauci answered. \u201cI don\u2019t see us going back into any more really very strict of restrictions.\u201dBUT\u2026Fauci continued, \u201cBut you always have to have the kind of flexibility: Remember when the CDC came out with the kind of modifications of their metrics which would lead to the guidelines of what regions or counties in the country should have a masking indoor? They made it very clear that as you pull back on restrictions, if we do see a significant surge, particularly one that might result in an increase in hospitalizations, we have to be prepared to pivot and perhaps reinstitute some of those restrictions.\u201dBREAKING: Fauci says it may be \u201cnecessary\u201d to \u201cre-institute\u201d COVID-19 restrictions to stop an additional surge, such as forced masking.AFLDS urges every single person to refuse to comply with any restriction on their freedom.Americans must never accept medical tyranny again.\u2014 Dr. Simone Gold (@drsimonegold) March 19, 2022RELATED: Reporter Asks Psaki Why The U.S. Can\u2019t Send More \u2018Offensive\u2019 Weapons To UkraineSo bringing back restrictions could be in the cards.Still, Fauci admitted, \u201cBut right now, at this point, George, I don\u2019t see that.\u201dFauci added later, \u201cThis virus has fooled us before and we really must be prepared for the possibility that we might get another variant.

The point is, we should also care this much for refugees in those facing occupation and war in the Middle East, and Asia and Africa too. The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to Western media compared to their browner and blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war.\u201dSurely with such a complaint, Reid \u2013 as part of the media, with a daily primetime national TV show \u2013 would regularly cover the war in Yemen, right?\u00a0Wrong!It feels like maybe we should have paid more attention to Putin\u2019s brutality toward Syria\u2026 but of course, those were brown Muslim people so\u2026\u2014 Joy-Ann (Pro-Democracy) Reid \ud83d\ude37 (@JoyAnnReid) March 16, 2022RELATED: Now Psaki Doesn\u2019t Want To Answer Questions About Her Past Claims That Hunter Biden\u2019s Laptop Was \u2018Russian Disinformation\u2019Since that segment aired on her show, Reid has all completely ignored the Yemeni war and anywhere else there might be unrest in \u201cbrowner\u201d countries than Ukraine.Mediate helpfully analyzed Reid\u2019s show \u2013 only to discover that since her complaint, she has not covered Yemen and had largely ignored it before then.It is here that Eric Bolling went in for the kill.

Lance Gooden, R-Texas, introduced the \u201cThink Tank and Nonprofit Foreign Influence Disclosure Act\u201d Thursday, which would require nonprofits and think tanks to disclose foreign donations over $50,000. The bill would require the U.S. Treasury Department to create a \u201cpublicly available in a searchable database information relating to such gifts and contributions received from foreign governments and political parties\u2026\u201dRELATED: Now That the NYT Has Granted Legitimacy To Hunter\u2019s Laptop, Will It Stop Being A Biden Lapdog?\u201cForeign governments and foreign political parties attempt to influence the government and political system of the United States through donations to nonprofit charitable organizations especially think tanks and cultural organizations,\u201d the bill reads. \u201cWhile institutions of higher learning are required to disclose foreign gifts to the Department of Education pursuant to the Higher Education Act, no such requirement exists for think tanks.\u201dGooden sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen earlier this month alleging that Russian-funded environmental groups are advocating against U.S. oil production in the name of climate change with the real motive of strengthening their own economy, which relies heavily on exporting oil.\u201cNumerous reports have confirmed Russia\u2019s extensive efforts to interfere in our government, perpetrated through environmental groups such as these, who take shelter behind their non-profit status and donor anonymity,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe are now experiencing the results of unchecked foreign interference to manipulate Americans\u2019 opinions about pipelines, fossil fuels, fracking, and climate change. The Treasury Department has a responsibility to the American people to shed light on the growing role environmental nonprofit organizations have in undermining our national security and American energy independence.\u201dThe new legislation points to a 2019 report from the Center for a New American Security, which said: \u201cA number of U.S. universities, academic departments, individual scholars, think tanks, and other civil society organizations receive substantial funding from Beijing that is often targeted at shaping views and discourse on China.\u201dFunding for those academic institutions suggests it could be more widespread.\u201cHigher degrees of transparency can help to ensure that this funding is not generating hidden forms of foreign lobbying, self-censorship, or other activities that undermine core U.S. democratic principles,\u201d the report said. \u201cTo that end, the U.S. government should significantly lower the funding cap that triggers a requirement for U.S. institutions to disclose these foreign contributions. Concurrently, Congress should also expand the reach of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to require universities to set standards and limits for student organizations and cultural exchange institutions that rely on external, especially foreign government, sources of funding.\u201dRELATED: Over A Third Of Americans Are Willing To Risk Nuclear War With Russia: PollThe Republican Study Committee released a report in June pointing out the same issue.\u201cAlthough universities are required to report foreign gifts above $250,000 as part of the Higher Education Act, this requirement does not currently exist for think tanks and other nonprofit organizations that may operate under the pretext of educational activities,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe Task Force therefore believes that think tanks and similar nonprofit institutions receiving significant funding, over $50,000 a year, from foreign governments, foreign political parties or foreign military entities, should be required to disclose that information for purposes of identifying conflicts of-interest.

Peder Zane for RealClearInvestigationsTalk about burying the lead. In the 24th paragraph of an article detailing the Department of Justice\u2019s ongoing probe into Hunter Biden\u2019s finances, the\u00a0New York Times finally acknowledges the authenticity of material\u00a0on the infamous laptop the president\u2019s son abandoned in a Delaware repair shop. The key passage reads:Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a\u00a0laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation.This, of course, is the same laptop \u2013 filled with explosive allegations of sketchy deals with foreign governments and suggestions of payoffs to Joe Biden \u2013 that the Times and other mainstream outlets ignored or dismissed as \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d after the New York Post first reported on it in October 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Twitter and Facebook\u00a0banned the Post from sharing its reporting.As the Post reported today:In the heat of the presidential race of 2020, the Times never missed a chance to cast doubt on the laptop, saying the information was \u2018purported\u2019 and quoting a letter from former Democratic officials who claimed \u2014 with no evidence \u2014 that it was Russian disinformation. As recently as September 2021, the Times called the laptop \u2018unsubstantiated\u2019 in a news story.RELATED: Now Psaki Doesn\u2019t Want To Answer Questions About Her Past Claims That Hunter Biden\u2019s Laptop Was \u2018Russian Disinformation\u2019Of course anyone with a pulse knew the laptop was real. While then-candidate Joe Biden trotted out the \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d narrative, his dissolute son Hunter never denied the possibility that the laptop belonged to him. In addition, a former business partner of the Bidens,\u00a0Tony Bobulinski, came forward at the time to both debunk Joe Biden\u2019s lie that he never discussed foreign business with his son and to claim that Joe was getting a cut of the profits.The damage of this disinformation campaign orchestrated by Democrats and their media allies is incalculable. Given Biden\u2019s razor-thin margins in several swing states, it is worth asking if he would have been elected president had these allegations of corruption received a full and fair airing. One poll by a conservative outfit found that\u00a017 percent of Biden supporters\u00a0said they might have changed their vote.Now that the Times has deigned to confer legitimacy on the laptop, the big question is whether it will pursue its leads.The place to start would be the 2017 email regarding a deal with Chinese energy executives that states, \u201c10 held by H for the big guy?\u201d We know H is Hunter and Bobulinksi has said that\u00a0Joe was commonly referred to as the \u201cbig guy.\u201dSyndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Political Insider.Don't let liberals in media silence conservatives.

It is filed on behalf of Pamela Ricard, a \u201cdecades-long\u201d teacher assigned to the school since 2005.RELATED: Virginia School Board Meeting Goes Off The Rails After New \u2018Equity\u2019 Policy Is Ruled Discriminatory (VIDEO)Ricard was reprimanded and suspended three days in April 2021 \u201cfor addressing a biologically female student by the student\u2019s legal and enrolled last name,\u201d according to the lawsuit, in an apparent attempt to avoid using the student\u2019s preferred first name. That name is not disclosed in the court filing, but a classmate has said the student preferred \u201che/him\u201d pronouns.The lawsuit says Ricard is a devout Christian who believes gender is assigned by God at conception, and that \u201cany policy that requires Ms. Ricard to refer to a student by a gendered, non-binary, or plural pronoun \u2026 or other gendered language that is different from the student\u2019s biological sex actively violates Ms. Ricard\u2019s religious beliefs.\u201dRicard requested a religious accommodation three times during an appeal of her discipline. In a closed meeting last August with the Board of Education, Ricard explained that her addressing the student as \u201cMiss (last name)\u201d was intended to be respectful while also protecting Ricard\u2019s religious beliefs.When the board later denied her appeal without a public vote, the Kansas Attorney General\u2019s office warned the district that it had violated the Kansas Open Meetings Act. The board then denied Ricard\u2019s appeal in a public vote at its September meeting.The district never did offer a possible accommodation of Ricard\u2019s religious beliefs, the suit says. Instead, the board voted at the September meeting to approve a policy mandating the use of student-preferred names and pronouns. At the time of Ricard\u2019s discipline last spring, the district didn\u2019t have such a formal policy.According to the lawsuit, the district and school \u201cnow threaten to punish Ms. Ricard again if she continues to refrain from using a student\u2019s preferred pronouns, express her views through silence or neutral language, or even engage in a neutral policy of referring to students by their enrolled last names or with other gender-neutral language. Under district policies, all teachers must now refer to each student \u2013 both in and out of class \u2013 using whatever names or pronouns the student claims reflect his or her particular gender identity on any given day.\u201dA school counselor had informed Ricard by email of the student\u2019s new preferred name, though the lawsuit says the email continued to address the student as \u201cshe.\u201d That spring, the suit says, school administrators had sent teachers a directive to use students\u2019 preferred names.In addition, a week after Ricard\u2019s three-day suspension and reprimand last April, the lawsuit says, the principal sent teachers \u201ctraining documents on diversity training on gender identity and gender expression,\u201d as well as protocols on the use of preferred names and pronouns.The lawsuit says teachers were told in the training documents that failure to use students\u2019 preferred names and pronouns \u201cwould constitute a discriminatory act subject to employee discipline\u201d and would be a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yet, the suit says, other examples of teachers having \u201cfailed or forgotten\u201d to use preferred names and pronouns have occurred during the current school year but have not been subject to disciplinary action.RELATED: Biden Admin Briefs TikTok Influencers To \u2018Help Sway Public Opinion\u2019 About Russia And War In UkraineAll of the district\u2019s directives, the lawsuit contends, are \u201cfor the purpose of lending credence to cultural ideas Ms. Ricard does not share or wish to advance that are contrary to her core religious beliefs.\u201dThe lawsuit says the district\u2019s and school\u2019s actions have deprived Ricard of her First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion, as well as her rights to due process and equal protection of the law. In addition, it says, Ricard is concerned for her students\u2019 well-being under the district\u2019s policies:\u201cMs. Ricard believes that, because of the difficulty of assessing matters of gender identity and the long-term irreversible consequences of certain treatments for transgender-identifying people, including puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy, and sex-reassignment surgery, children should not be encouraged to undertake social or medical transition because of their inability to assess long-term consequences.\u201dRicard, a math teacher, also maintains \u201cthat parents have a fundamental right to control the upbringing and education of their children,\u201d and that \u201cany gender-identity education policy must account for this fundamental right.\u201dThe lawsuit, filed by Kriegshauser Ney Law Group in Olathe, seeks a declaratory judgment that the defendants violated Ricard\u2019s rights; injunctions against such violations; a purge of her disciplinary record; and \u201cnominal damages\u201d and attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201cThe school district disciplined Ms. Ricard not for something she said, but for something she couldn\u2019t say,\u201d one of her attorneys, Josh Ney, said in a statement.The\u00a0author has requested comment from a district spokesperson.Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.Michael Ryan is Executive Editor of\u00a0The Lion.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Political Insider.Don't let liberals in media silence conservatives.

Not only did Donald Trump want the economy back open, he said that by Easter Sunday of 2020, \u201cyou will have packed churches all over the country.\u201d It never happened, at least not on the scale he envisioned.Two years later, after millions of vaccines have been administered and the virus has receded from its peak, things look very different. A sign of the times: After two years, the White House plans to resume regular public tours. Doors are scheduled to open on Good Friday.As Biden officials smile about the poetry of that rhyming calendar, the White House is dealing with a political paradox: How to secure more COVID aid from Congress as the administration pivots away from the pandemic. It\u2019s proving to be a hard sell.RELATED: Comptroller\u2019s Audit Finds Former NY Governor Andrew Cuomo \u2018Misled The Public\u2019 On Nursing Home DeathsThe same morning the White House announced a return to business as usual for tourists, the administration raised the alarm about a virus they believe is on the run. Cases are down 95% since the peak of the omicron variant. Hospitalizations have similarly plunged by 85%. More than 215 million Americans are already fully vaccinated. Yet officials warned on a call with reporters Tuesday morning that their pandemic coffers could soon be empty.\u201cFor months, we\u2019ve made clear to Congress, on a bipartisan basis, that the funding for tests, treatments, and vaccines was drying up and that additional funds would be needed,\u201d the official said.How much money do they need? The number administration officials floated was $22.5 billion. And if they don\u2019t get it? White House budgeteers will make trims to the request. They warn, however, that the U.S. won\u2019t have enough boosters or variant-specific vaccines \u201cfor all Americans,\u201d according to a fact sheet provided by the administration.They won\u2019t be able to buy monoclonal antibody treatments, either, and the current supply is expected to run out as soon as May. Without a cash infusion, they predict that the testing capacity will collapse.Governors were warned late Tuesday morning that the administration would be reducing the number of monoclonal antibody treatments by 30% within a week.Republicans say they aren\u2019t necessarily opposed to more COVID spending. They just want to know where all the other COVID cash went first, as\u00a0Sen. Richard Shelby explained to Politico. \u201cThere\u2019s a doubt that they need this money with a lot of us,\u201d explained the Alabama Republican. \u201cI\u2019ve said this for weeks, a real accounting of the money [already spent on COVID] that the American people deserve and then go from there. If there\u2019s no money left, and it\u2019s not hidden somewhere, and if they show a need, then you got, maybe, a persuasive case.\u201dAsked if the White House would negotiate for a lower number, a Biden official gave an emphatic \u201cno.\u201d And when then asked if they would accept using different funds for their COVID priorities, the official demurred, saying only that \u201cthe money they provided over a year ago has been well spent, but we defer to Congress on the specific legislative approach.\u201dIt is a routine kind of squabble, albeit one that comes at the tail end of a once-in-a-century pandemic. The difficulty for Biden may be that the public is moving on after he pivoted away from the virus during his State of the Union address. Masks are increasingly uncommon these days.\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci has receded\u00a0from the cable news circuit. News of a land war in Europe now eclipses COVID coverage.RELATED: Rand Paul Proposes Amendment To Eliminate Fauci\u2019s Government Position EntirelyWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told RealClearPolitics that COVID funding was a necessity, despite the public\u2019s shifting attention. \u201cWe\u2019re in a different stage and we have a range of tools in order to fight the pandemic,\u201d she explained, adding that in order to keep up that fight, \u201cWe need money.\u201d A new subvariant of the virus, BA2 omicron, has already made it to American shores. It is apparently even more transmissible than the original Omicron strain, Psaki noted, but also treatable. \u201cWe need to have masks, tests, boosters, treatments for [the] immunocompromised in order to continue to treat the American people during a pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it remains urgent.\u201dThat urgency was underscored by breaking news Tuesday evening. At least nine Democrats had already tested positive for the virus\u00a0after those lawmakers attended a party retreat\u00a0last week in Philadelphia. The president was also at the event, but he tested negative Sunday night, Psaki told reporters. Then, Kamala Harris\u2019 husband Doug Emhoff tested positive.The vice president had stood shoulder to shoulder with Biden earlier in the day at an indoor event, and she was expected to share the stage with the president at an event in the East Room of the White House to celebrate \u201cEqual Pay Day.\u201d The room was packed front to back, but Harris wasn\u2019t there.\u201cEarlier today, the Second Gentleman tested positive for COVID-19. Out of an abundance of caution, the Vice President will not participate in tonight\u2019s event,\u201d the White House announced just moments before Biden entered the room. \u201cThe Vice President tested negative for COVID-19 today and will continue to test.\u201d The president shrugged off the news like it was routine.\u201cWelcome to the White House,\u201d Biden told the crowd that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and numerous members of his cabinet. \u201cThis is the biggest crowd we\u2019ve had since we got here.\u201d Only later, after a gaffe where he mistakenly said that \u201cthe first lady\u2019s husband contracted COVID,\u201d did Biden ask the mostly unmasked crowd to send to Harris \u201cour love.\u201dSyndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Political Insider.Don't let liberals in media silence conservatives.

China and Russia are also eying new economic opportunities in the war-torn, landlocked country where feuding tribal elements have defied foreign occupiers throughout historyWith this in mind, the\u00a0Vandenberg Coalition\u2019s Afghanistan Working Group moved forward with releasing its planned report this week, a set of prescriptions its members believe will help restore American goals in the region and assist stalled international humanitarian relief efforts. One of the coalition\u2019s overarching U.S. goals in Afghanistan focuses on China\u2019s growing global influence on international display as Russia turns to Beijing for economic assistance.First reviewed by RealClearPolitics,\u00a0the report\u00a0argues that countering Sino inroads in Afghanistan is a critical U.S. national security interest, but that the U.S. should avoid trying to check Beijing\u2019s every move, because doing so could become a costly distraction to more crucial competition in the region.\u201cChina is unlikely to cooperate in a process that erodes Taliban control in Afghanistan and will instead attempt to increase its influence and access in Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Pakistan,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe U.S. is best served by focusing on competing with China primarily in the Indo-Pacific while otherwise raising costs for Chinese cooperation with the Taliban.\u201dIn \u201climited instances,\u201d the report asserts, U.S. and Chinese goals actually may align, especially when it comes to cracking down on terrorism safe havens in Afghanistan.If China follows through with its interest in the country\u2019s natural resources, it will have an incentive to keep militant activity to a minimum while balancing its efforts to strengthen Pakistan. Beijing has so far refrained from recognizing the Taliban as the legitimate government, but Chinese media have highlighted the economic opportunities the new Islamic leadership presents for Beijing, particularly for lithium mining.RELATED: Hunter Biden On List Of Americans Sanctioned By RussiaTerrorist attacks, however, could disrupt mining activity. The Taliban has pledged not to allow foreign militants to regroup. Still, al-Qaeda, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and the Islamic State Khorasan, or ISK, and many others continue to reside in the country, according to the\u00a0first United Nations report on terrorism levels\u00a0in Afghanistan since the U.S. withdrawal, released in January. The report found that ISK is regrouping, carrying out attacks more frequently, with its membership in Afghanistan doubling since August.When it comes to relations with the Taliban itself, the report urges the Biden administration to continue to diplomatically isolate the group that seized power as U.S.-backed forces collapsed and not to recognize it as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. The coalition also stressed the importance of preventing the Taliban from gaining \u201cany access to or benefits from\u201d bilateral and multilateral assistance.However, the Vandenberg Afghanistan working group could not come to a consensus on whether the U.S. should maintain all of its current sanctions on the Taliban. Some group members advocate keeping U.S. and international sanctions in place and maintaining strict limits on the Taliban\u2019s use of funds held by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Others argued that aggressive sanctions would exacerbate the suffering of the Afghan people without destabilizing the Taliban.After Afghanistan fell to Taliban control, the Biden administration insisted that the U.S. would maintain \u201cover-the-horizon\u201d counter-terrorism capabilities \u2013 the ability to assess from afar the state of the terrorist threat emanating from the country. But the coalition believes more concrete steps are needed to enhance U.S. intelligence gathering.The report urges the Biden administration to expand cooperation with countries in the region, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan bilaterally and in conjunction with Turkey and Azerbaijan, to secure access for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance collection, as well as aerial strikes. The opposite is true for Pakistan, the report asserts, recommending that the U.S. avoid working with Islamabad as much as possible while bolstering relations with India.The U.S. should only engage with Pakistan\u2019s leaders to the \u201cminimal extent necessary to retain access to its airspace to conduct drone strikes in Afghanistan,\u201d the report stated. \u201cWith the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the United States has an opportunity to exert more diplomatic and economic pressure on Pakistan than in the past and raise the costs of its ongoing support for the Taliban.\u201dRELATED: Over A Third Of Americans Are Willing To Risk Nuclear War With Russia: PollThe Coalition also recommends that the U.S. restart non-lethal aid to the National Resistance Front, a military alliance of anti-Taliban Afghans who remain the only holdout group refusing to surrender to Taliban control. In trying to channel U.S. humanitarian assistance to the areas of greatest need, the coalition offers several recommendations, including a pointed policy difference with the Biden administration.The report urges Congress to pass legislation reversing a U.S. decision that would allow humanitarian non-governmental organizations to pay taxes or fees to the Haqqani network, long one of the most lethal and vicious factions of the Taliban.\u201cCongress should consider enacting legislation to reverse this action and free the status quo sanctions regime to ensure that the Biden administration cannot pursue similar policies moving forward,\u201d the report states.Other important top-line recommendations:\u201cBeyond the immediate issues of addressing the humanitarian crisis, the United States should ensure the United Nations, especially [that] the Security Council and other key international partners are working towards the restoration of a legitimate and Constitutional governmental order where the rights of all are respected, and political issues are settled at the ballot box and in parliamentary sessions rather than at the barrel of a gun,\u201d the report concluded.Because it\u2019s unlikely that the Taliban would willingly agree to elections, humanitarian access, and other threats to their hold on power, \u201cthe United States and others must be willing to deploy multilateral and bilateral coercive measures,\u201d the report said.Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.Susan Crabtree is RealClearPolitics\u2019 White House/national political correspondent.Read this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.comThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Political Insider.Don't let liberals in media silence conservatives.

We understand that,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cWe are adequate people.\u201dThe Ukrainian president continued, \u201cFor years, we have heard about the supposedly open door, but we have also heard that we should not enter, and this is true and we must admit it,\u201d he said of Ukraine\u2019s efforts to join NATO, which began in 2008.\u00a0The Ukrainian President\u2019s admission also included a swipe at NATO \u2013 which was created in 1949 as a mutual defense agreement in opposition to the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact.\u201cThe Russian invasion of Ukraine destroyed everything that security in our region \u2014 and I am sure international security \u2014 was based on,\u201d Zelensky said, \u201cthe weight of the organizations we all hoped for, the force of international conventions. It has also called into question the world\u2019s most powerful alliance, NATO.\u201dWhile Zelensky\u2019s statement was a much needed aspect of ending the current war in his country perpetrated by Russia, this declaration should have come sooner.As Ted Galen Carpenter observed in The Guardian at the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, \u201cVladimir Putin bears primary responsibility for this latest development, but Nato\u2019s arrogant, tone-deaf policy toward Russia over the past quarter-\u200bcentury deserves a large share as well.\u201d\u201cAnalysts committed to a US foreign policy of realism and restraint have warned for more than a quarter-\u200bcentury that continuing to expand the most powerful military alliance in history toward another major power would not end well,\u201d Galen Carpenter noted. \u201cThe war in Ukraine provides definitive confirmation that it did not.\u201dMany U.S. officials have warned against NATO enlargement for decades for exactly this reason.Former president Bill Clinton\u2019s secretary of state Madeline Albright wrote in her memoir, \u201c[Russian president Boris] Yeltsin and his countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement, seeing it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability and moving Europe\u2019s dividing line to the east, leaving them isolated.\u201dGeorge Kennan, the famous Truman Cold Warrior who is credited with the \u201ccontainment\u201d doctrine of the Soviet Union, warned in a New York Times interview in May 1998 regarding NATO expansion, \u201cI think it is the beginning of a new cold war. I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies.\u201d\u201cI think it is a tragic mistake,\u201d Kennan forebode.\u00a0Bob Gates, the Secretary of Defense under George W. Bush and Barack Obama, warned \u201ctrying to bring Georgia and Ukraine into Nato was truly overreaching\u201d. The notion was \u201crecklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their own vital national interests\u201d.Much of this history leading up to this point has been forgotten, or most likely simply ignored.\u00a0As the LA Times points out,\u00a0In early February 1990, U.S. leaders made the Soviets an offer. According to transcripts of meetings in Moscow on Feb. 9, then-Secretary of State James Baker suggested that in exchange for cooperation on Germany, U.S. could make \u201ciron-clad guarantees\u201d that NATO would not expand \u201cone inch eastward.\u201d Less than a week later, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to begin reunification talks.\"Expanding #NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire cold-war era.\" \u2013 George Kennan, 1997\u2014 W R (@rylan7) March 16, 2022So, while no excuses should be made for Putin, many saw this coming.Reasonable people can debate the pros and cons \u2013 but we should all be absolutely clear about the potential consequences.\u00a0The \u201cit\u2019s not about NATO\u201d crowd must be very confused by Zelensky now saying Ukraine probably won\u2019t join NATO.

Russell for RealClearEnergyThe root causes of the economic upheaval most Americans are experiencing right now are the subject of much discussion lately. Is it the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Is it Biden\u2019s closing of the Keystone XL pipeline? Is it the absurd energy policies of the EU? Certainly there is plenty of blame to go around, but the reality is that all of this started in October of 2020.Back then, Trump and Biden were going head to head in debates leading up to the November election. Biden famously\u00a0stated\u00a0\u201cI would transition away from the oil industry.\u201d\u00a0That statement was a clear signal to energy producers in this country that Biden\u2019s eventual ascent to the presidency would bring unprecedented uncertainty for at least the next four years. Never willing to let a crisis go to waste, the Biden administration went straight to work dismantling the future of our oil and gas refining capacity.RELATED: After Blaming \u2018Putin\u2019s Price Hike,\u2019 Biden Now Blames \u2018Greedy\u2019 Oil Companies For High Gas PricesHis statement in October of 2020 made it clear that his administration would use the massive increase in government control precipitated by the pandemic to massively curtail energy production not in the distant future, but here and now.Though oil production has rebounded to some extent from the demand-driven crash in 2020, refining and drilling are still well below pre-pandemic levels. The regulatory uncertainty imposed on traditional energy production is simply too great. Biden can\u00a0complain\u00a0that these companies aren\u2019t throwing money away to save his poll numbers, but a lifetime politician like him is in no place to criticize those who provide essential goods and services to the American public.Biden\u2019s insistence that his policies have no role in the pain Americans feel right now should fall on deaf ears.So just how severe is this pain? Carl Quintanilla of CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d shared this graph in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0on March 8th in an apparent attempt to put a damper on concerns about gasoline prices. Quintanilla states that the graph represents \u201cgasoline costs, as consumer\u2019s share of wallet\u201d but that\u2019s not entirely correct. For one, the graph clearly states that it takes account of other energy products and that it is computed as a share of \u201call consumer spending.\u201d\u00a0His intended point is obvious enough: Americans shouldn\u2019t complain about high gas prices because, as a share of total spending, gasoline is very low by historical standards. Quintanilla\u2019s comment sounds like the author of the graph added up all the money spent on the various things we buy and compared the dollars spent on fuel to the total. That\u2019s not the case.\u00a0RELATED: Biden Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg Says Gas Prices Can Be Offset By Cheaper Insulin And Child CareA much better representation of the impact on Americans\u2019 wallets would include information about the astronomical inflation we\u2019ve seen in other essential products Americans buy. It would also have a concrete measure of the \u201cwallet\u201d Quintanilla mentions.The graph below uses data on average production and non-supervisory hourly\u00a0wages\u00a0over the past ten years as a baseline gross monthly income. The most recent data available indicates that the average wage for such workers is $26.94 per hour. I assumed that the household drove about 250 miles a week in a car with 20 miles per gallon average fuel efficiency.The blue line shows monthly gasoline expense based on these assumptions using data on conventional gasoline\u00a0prices. So without regard to income and other expenses Americans have to cover, we are paying about the same now as we were during the high gas price era of Obama\u2019s second term: just under $200 per month.But what about the total household budget? Haven\u2019t wages risen over the past ten years, making the increased expense less onerous? Production and non-supervisory wages have risen steadily from 2012 to 2022 to the tune of about 3.75% per year. Dividing the monthly gasoline expense by gross monthly income, we get the red line.RELATED: Will Dems\u2019 Green Dream Fuel GOP Red Wave?During the Trump administration, gasoline as a share of income was right around 3.25% of the budget, according to my simple calculations. In 2021, it began to rise again and currently sits as high as it has been for the past 6 years.\u00a0Those who are sympathetic to Quintanilla\u2019s point might say that we have validated the graph in his tweet, that American\u2019s aren\u2019t as bad off as many claim. However, this analysis misses the rising cost of nearly\u00a0everything\u00a0else in Americans\u2019 household budgets. Starting in mid-2021, prices of staple goods began to skyrocket.The most recent report shows that, compared to this time last year, food and beverage\u00a0prices\u00a0rose 7.6%, durable goods prices (such as appliances and cars)\u00a0rose\u00a018.7%, and overall energy prices\u00a0rose\u00a025.6%.\u00a0Inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. While the Federal Reserve contemplates decreases in the money supply to deal with the money component, the Biden administration\u2019s regulatory chaos continues to restrict our ability to produce the things Americans need.Blaming inflation on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, which is also partly his fault, does nothing to alleviate the stranglehold Biden has on our economy.Syndicated with permission from Real Clear Wire.Levi A.

Maybe we should find alternative financial channels, pronto. \u00a0I'm yet to read the 500 page PDF, but am curious, do Scope 3 disclosures include the greenhouse gas emissions from employees? Like, hiring someone with a longer commute may result in higher emissions reported, underuse of work from home policies, or even use of labor in high emissions markets (USA) vs low emissions (take your pick of developing countries).If not, it creates a disadvantage from employing Capital vs Labor - if energy use on servers/forklifts/conveyor belts must be captured, this then creates a disincentive to employing such labor saving technologies if you're not capturing the carbon \"savings\" from not needing people to perform the procedures anymore. Another nudge against productivity growth.\"The SEC has already required the production of new information, and as Hester Price [*] makes perfectly clear, the climate rules again make a huge dinner out of that appetizer... .\"[*]  Commissioner Hester M.

Pierce:Required disclosures of so-called transition risks also present these challenges. \u00a0The proposal defines \u201ctransition risks\u201d broadly as:the actual or potential negative impacts on a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains attributable to regulatory, technological, and market changes to address the mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate-related risks, such as increased costs attributable to changes in law or policy, reduced market demand for carbon-intensive products leading to decreased prices or profits for such products, [JC: how about skyrocketing prices of carbon-intensive products due to regulatory strangulation of supply, like look out the window?] the devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and litigation defense costs, competitive pressures associated with the adoption of new technologies, reputational impacts (including those stemming from a registrant\u2019s customers or business counterparties) [JC: disclose that the twitter mob might be after you] that might trigger changes to market behavior, consumer preferences or behavior, and registrant behavior.[35]Transition risk can derive from potential changes in markets, technology, law, or the more nebulous \u201cpolicy,\u201d which companies will have to analyze across multiple jurisdictions and all across their \u201cvalue chains.\u201d \u00a0These transition assessments are rooted in prophecies of coming governmental and market action, but experience teaches us that such prophecies often do not come to fruition. \u00a0Markets and technology are inherently unpredictable. \u00a0Domestic legislative efforts in this context have failed for decades,[36] and international agreements, like the Paris Accords, have seen the United States in and out and back in again.[37] \u00a0I.e. make up what the regulators want to hear.\u00a0VI.

That's the only reason to build them. They don't make sense without the tax credit.\"It reminds me of WEllington who was opposed to trains because it  let \"ordinary people get  around  unnecessarily\"I live near NYC...I have not attended a party in 5 years without some ex-banker telling me how he is MAKING a killing on renewable deals!If you wanted to lower CO2...bang for buck is first reduce usage, 2nd Nuclear power, solar and wind operate around 40% of the time...and our terrible solutions!--Judenstern! In more local practice, a method of recreating the Salem witchcraft trials.--The federal government is pursuing contradictory policies, or wishes or rhetoric, on energy prices and the environment. That needn't bother politicians who appeal to one or the other or both interest groups. And it doesn't. The [political] chickens will surely come home to roost, but not just yet.The following thoughts were provoked by an abridged review of the 510-page S.E.C. document: \"The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors\", [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33-11042.pdf].The proposed rules will have an effect similar to the effect that \"Sarbanes-Oxley\" had on registration and new public listings, i.e., negative.Apart from the obvious creation of demand for more accountants and corporate lawyers, the proposed rules will increase the potential liability of corporate boards of directors and executives and officers of registrants.The level of detail stipulated in the proposed rules will give rise to costs that will likely outweigh the possible benefit that the rules are intended to achieve.The time horizons for the projected \"likely material effects\" are not specified, but comments are invited on whether the proposed rules should specify ranges (in years) for \"short-\", \"medium-\", and \"long-term\" horizons.  The rule notification suggests 1-3 years or 1-5 years for short-term material effects, etc., up to and including 40 to 50 years for long-term material effects.  This begs the question of the reliability of forecasts out to those horizons and the difficulty of determining the probability of events that would give rise to future \"likely material effects\" that would require disclosure under the proposed rules.  A new caste of \"fortune tellers\" will be needed to foretell those events and the probability of occurrence.It is easy to imagine that firms adversely affected by the proposed rules will soon be considering de-registration.  The proposed rules cover foreign corporations registered with the S.E.C.  Those foreign corporations may soon be considering de-registration.  Private corporations that may have been considering going public in the U.S. will now have to re-consider those plans if the proposed rules impose onerous filing requirements (cf. \"Sarbanes-Oxley\").The evident absence of balance between the cost of preparing the disclosures required under the proposed rules, and the alleged benefits accruing to shareholders from those required disclosures will need to be addressed by the Commission if it is to meet its legislative mandate.Administrative law in the U.S. is increasingly burdensome.  At some point, the attractiveness of U.S. markets to corporations seeking raise risk capital will decline.  We may be witnesses to that decline in the coming years.The trend towards \"going private\", exemplified by Dell Computer, may be given a boost by the proposed rules.  At a minimum, as noted earlier, corporations will find it increasingly difficult to recruit qualified candidates for membership on corporate boards of directors, officers and executives.What will the industrial basis of the United States look like in ten, twenty, or fifty years from now?  Will manufacturing be outsourced to Asia to the extent that no sizeable manufacturing base is present in the U.S.?  To avoid having to report Scope 3 emissions (upstream suppliers' and downstream distribution chains' and customers' emissions), corporations will refrain from making commitments to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.  Is this a desireable outcome for these proposed rules?This doesn't even address the best/worst part.  Since almost anything now can be deemed to be securities fraud, crafty lawyers for climate activists will take advantage of the necessarily sweeping but nebulous disclosure calculations to assert fraud claims against disfavored companies and industries.  The nuisance will cost defendants millions to defend.  Same as it ever was.In my nearly 40 years of reading SEC disclosures, the only purpose for imposing such nebulous disclosures is to feed the plaintiff's bar--another area for plaintiff lawyers to go after companies with so-called strike suits. Shameful as it is obvious. There will never be sufficient disclosures to satisfy the plaintiff bar because stuff happens, the future is not known and cannot be known. Looking backwards, as these lawsuit do, is a con.This looks like a data grab - not entirely bad if we want evidence based policies. But I figure it'll just be another form of accounting where 2 + 2 = fish. I don't think it'll be good data. Curious. After Raskin withdrew as Biden's Fed nominee over a clash about her  climate views. Hayek put it best. \"Pretense of knowledge.\" SEC regulators can't have all the information necessary to implement this nonsense. Thinking on the margin, how are firms to know the habits of their suppliers and customers? In the real world of unpredictability the disclosures demanded by the SEC introduces more risk into capital markets. The cost of compliance for a hedge fund managing a billion dollars costs around six million dollars a year. the opportunity cost has to be the market rate of return. When implemented, I suspect compliance costs will substantially increase.   I am very happy to be retired from my former trade of corporate lawyer. One of my tasks was preparing my clients annual SEC filings. My clients were small public companies. One of them was a chain of 20 to 30 sitdown restaurants in the \"casual dinning\" sector (not fast food not white table cloth).They probably could have disclosed how much natural gas and how much electricity they purchased every year, but telling you what their emissions were? Good lord, they were chefs not engineers.But the idea of disclosing: \"GHG emissions from ... downstream activities in its value chain\" is downright funny. \"We estimate that the food consumed in our restaurants produced 100,000 pounds of poopoo and 100,000 gallons of peepee. Additionally we sold 50,000 servings of bean chili that produced 10,000 cubic feet of intestinal gas containing 70% methane which is a very potent GHG.Our government is being run by lunatics. It is not a good feeling while the Russians are brandishing nuclear weapons while they murder innocent civilians.The Fed and SEC entering climate policy-making...seems like using a hammer to garden with.I have an idea. If we wish to reduce carbon emissions, let us tax fuel consumption. Preferably in exchange for lower wage taxes...but hey, why reward productive behavior?This seems to mirror the conflict minerals disclosure which seems to be required of all companies, given the number of annual reports with a section that basically says \"we don't manufacture anything so don't use minerals.\"Barron's sees that the SEC is using regulation to dictate climate policy:https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-climate-risk-disclosure-rule-51647880796\"SEC Unveils New Rules to Combat Climate Change\" By Lauren Foster FollowUpdated March 21, 2022 6:07 pm ET / Original March 21, 2022 12:41 pm ETThw Western world has been going mad for decades, this is just an extension of the self-destructive trend.This really seems like an overreaction to disclosure rules. I would understand such criticisms about a extensive regulation of alleged \"climate risks\", but this outcry just because companies will be required to disclose their environmental performance is excessive and sounds more like a pretext for anti-climate regulation than a serious point of substance. ESG investing is a real thing, whether you like it or not. And ESG investors need information on environmental performance of companies. What is wrong with giving such investors a sound information basis? This allows better matching of demand and supply. Since when is Mr Cochrane against efficient markets?I lost 7 figures on HQS, a microcap Chinese tilipia farm on AMEX. Total fraud. SEC did nothing. Worthless.

That is how infinitely more important Ukraine for Russia than it is for the West. Just look at the map. I would not be surprised if Russia will fight this war not only until the last Ukrainian soldier, but until the last Russian soldier and the last piece of bread. In contrast, the American public will likely switch their attention away once the war ends and there is some other news. Why could not Ukraine stay a neutral country that is friendly to both the West and Russia? This would have been great for the Ukrainian economy, Ukraine would have kept Crimea and there would have been no war now. Ukrainians want to join the EU, and Russia has not opposed this (e.g., it does not oppose Serbia joining the EU). As for NATO, why to hurry and ignore Russian position? This could have been postponed for, say, 50 years until Putin is gone and Russia becomes more democratic. What a blunder! The West did not act in the best interest of Ukraine, while claiming to be its friend, and even Ukrainian politicians did not, probably because they listened to their Western advisors too much.  Why? Because Ukraine is a free and independent nation and has the right to decide for themselves what countries that want to align themselves with. NATO is not an organization that has a history of aggression with its neighbors and is, in fact, founded on the notion of providing a defense against Soviet Union aggression (now Russia), which does in fact not only has a long standing of aggression against its neighbors but continues to have a goal of world-wide hegemony. Ukrainians have been subject to the Russian way of life and they have independently voted to reject it. By what thinking does Putin believe he has the 'right' to upend the wishes of more than 40 million people.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

Niall touched on it briefly a bit: the role of desperation.Remember, The Third Reich came to power because Germany had embraced a man who they believed would return them to greatness. Germany was once the home of mystics in Europe and home of the Rational Enlightenment. But the crushing economic obligations placed upon the Germans to prevent the resurgence of a belligerent European power ended up blowing up in their faces. Why? Desperation has a way of pushing people to the edge. Remember, Putin has been quoted as saying, \"If there's no Russia, why do we need the world?\"The other mistake I see, again, comes from lessons in WWII. Letting Adolf run amok in Europe for years led to a very, very, very BAD conflict later on. I'm concerned NATO is allowing the same thing with Putin. Regardless of which outcome comes forth, it will be rooted in desperation and avoiding shame. China is certainly taking notes on everything being done on both sides. And, today! Saudi Arabia will accept the Yuan for oil. Bye bye petro dollar?It was a good episode.  Mike Gallagher comes across as an impressive person & HR was in his element.  I prefer the Goodfellas episodes with someone who has real knowledge about something -- rather than people who are professional yakkers. Thanks for an interesting conversation. Niall Ferguson seemed to be the most informed and closest to the reality, which is to be expected, as a historian he knows the history of the conflict and the history of Ukraine and Russia. I am glad that John seemed to back up on enforcement of a no-fly-zone, and he ruled out bombing Moscow. It would be nice if the conversation discussed the events leading to the war, such as USA arguments, Ukrainian arguments, Russian arguments, NATO expansion, and other major relevant events. Well, I guess this would be out of scope and would take too much time. Great episode - highly recommended!Impression:  The U.S. military is becoming less capable, not more capable, according to the participants in this latest Goodfellows segment.  H.R. McMillan: Give the Ukrainian forces medium-range surface-to-air and surface-to-ship missiles to create a no-fly zone above Ukraine.  N. Fergusson: The conflict in the Ukraine is part of a larger developing conflict; limiting the discussion to theaters, such as the Ukraine, the Middle-East, or Indo-Pacific regions, is an incorrect approach.  M. Galligher: The direction that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff are headed is entirely wrong and misguided--focus on the present and near-term needs/risks; the Biden administration's emphasis on climate change is doing great damage to the economy and the ability of the nation to contend with these risks.The discussion was informative.

Don't bother with the negotiated mercantilism of trade deals -- the \"you can sell to us if our exporters can sell to you\" deals. The point of a foreign country's exports is to get dollars, and the point of dollars is for them to buy from the US. Full stop.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Doug reveals that this story is far too simplistic to understand the closed economies of the 1950s through 1970s, and the great trade liberalization that the world experienced starting in the 1980s -- and which we are very sadly likely to lose in the years ahead. A little reminder of what we gained, and a sad peak:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhc08U26yJOgDRn5NxJYCdXv4JGKHAD9ZenWn2Yc1lXWltsZKVFEyKRxa5ga1OPuX7iJcsmtrn6rRSCOUFuxOUT8xLshDhmGoMy8W_rX4tMZ7aALNpvBZWoA_EZt7kdsoCW-kQ-SpeECcMz5Z5_hETe68ohzrTeJJ-76gGRQyQRWfQOF5uFh3zUH0c=s2310\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhc08U26yJOgDRn5NxJYCdXv4JGKHAD9ZenWn2Yc1lXWltsZKVFEyKRxa5ga1OPuX7iJcsmtrn6rRSCOUFuxOUT8xLshDhmGoMy8W_rX4tMZ7aALNpvBZWoA_EZt7kdsoCW-kQ-SpeECcMz5Z5_hETe68ohzrTeJJ-76gGRQyQRWfQOF5uFh3zUH0c=w400-h233\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div>The process of liberalization started with money, not tariffs: Countries first devalued overvalued currency, usually to a floating rate. Then they eliminated quantitative restrictions on imports including import licenses. Then they reduced tariffs.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>In turn, how did they get there, and why did they not reform earlier? The standard story pits domestic industry vs. consumers. Domestic industries have concentrated interest in protection, consumers are diffuse. That accounts for status quo bias, but not why they eventually changed.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The source of the problem, and reason for the change is different. Countries (especially in the \"developing\" world) were hit with a \"terms of trade\" shock -- they exported commodities, say, to import goods; the commodity price went down so they could not buy imports. Many countries were financing imports with foreign aid and borrowing, and those transfers dried up.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>What do they do? They have to choose between deflation, currency depreciation, or import controls. &nbsp;Deflation at the same exchange rate makes foreign goods more expensive. Depreciation does the same, without changing the domestic price level. Or, stop imports by direct controls, and by rationing foreign exchange leading to a black market. In the early postwar view, consistent with Bretton Woods, they chose the latter. (Why is there so much nostalgia for Bretton Woods? It was a rotten system.)&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Naturally, it didn't work. Eventually they gave up and devalued or floated the exchange rate. Now there is no need to ration foreign exchange or to restrict imports by license. (Tariffs are bad, but quantitative restrictions are worse, since you never know what the cost is, and then imports are allocated by political rather than economic reasons. Just paying a tax is more efficient!) They moved to exports in order to generate foreign exchange to buy imports.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhn1W-sFxGS884lqGrqtganTnIfEAzxWfVV5ZypzGEsDZCRSnWQyJ8_U-YjVeNzeJIaqG-aXmNiR2qvzLsrsaLbdT2D6v_g_r7nJCMbY0jv1LEl7083ihkphyypC_YlVigJ97B7Z_0evHHASOuuuTaM6uDeJpMoDtEHa2nVDU8dkkA6wYaBP5AH4is=s1676\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"290\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhn1W-sFxGS884lqGrqtganTnIfEAzxWfVV5ZypzGEsDZCRSnWQyJ8_U-YjVeNzeJIaqG-aXmNiR2qvzLsrsaLbdT2D6v_g_r7nJCMbY0jv1LEl7083ihkphyypC_YlVigJ97B7Z_0evHHASOuuuTaM6uDeJpMoDtEHa2nVDU8dkkA6wYaBP5AH4is=w400-h290\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgYq6cg9k7AOWF1JtFesWMo11nffi3fH2xp-ONr_JfFLmfcY0usGboqY0SAmPUfQ559l05RNT9OLkywLHj-xTevcDDLgWFGjHzay-2OvL_CdcKtD1GXuI9czRFeWt__CogzClv8bkvGBWiIBGSWt5N8xdc0XYT8hrnt7ooPqUAFCaCxJt6_hSztG-I=s1548\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"346\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgYq6cg9k7AOWF1JtFesWMo11nffi3fH2xp-ONr_JfFLmfcY0usGboqY0SAmPUfQ559l05RNT9OLkywLHj-xTevcDDLgWFGjHzay-2OvL_CdcKtD1GXuI9czRFeWt__CogzClv8bkvGBWiIBGSWt5N8xdc0XYT8hrnt7ooPqUAFCaCxJt6_hSztG-I=w400-h346\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div>So, Doug answers the central question:&nbsp;</div><blockquote><div>Why no reform in 1970s? \u201cforeign exchange reserves kill the will to reform\u201d&nbsp;</div></blockquote><div>Oil and commodity export countries were flush with cash to buy imports.

Is there any way I can receive your posts in my email automatically? Something like a newsletter?The conversation session captured in the video serves to remind us that the U.S. and most other countries are 'open economies' to a greater or lesser degree. As such, 'closed-economy' models, such as the three-equation new Keynesian DSGE model, are inapplicable to much of the World's economies. Fiscal policy interacts with monetary policy and balance of payments in open economies, as is well known.  In a closed economy, the interaction with the balance of payments is absent (no imports or exports of goods or capital occur in a closed economy).  One could argue that taken as a whole, the global economy is a 'closed economy' and, as a consequence, the three-equation new Keynesian DSGE model would apply if there was but one fiscal and one monetary authority. That ideal does not exist at present, of course, and the three-equation new Keynesian DSGE model remains a theoretical curiosity for the present.  Where does the fiscal theory of the price level fit in an open-economy model?  It does fit, but it requires modification to take into consideration balance of payment constraints and international capital flows because the economic system is open.  Theoretical thermodynamics, for example, distinguishes between a closed system in which there is no interchange between the system and the environment not in the system, and an open system in which interchange with the surrounding environment is a material part of the system dynamics.  Most published papers on the FTPL base their analyses on closed economic system dynamics.  Adaptation of the FTPL to open economies would broaden and deepen the applicability of the theory to the practical issues facing modern economies.  Thanks for posting the video it was most educational and served as a welcome refresher course for international business and international finance graduate courses taken forty-years ago.Comments are welcome.

They are making a judgement that Ukraine can survive without it, and that the extra death and destruction in Ukraine is not worth the risk. I hope people are questioning this judgement, but pundits should \u00a0defer a little bit to people in charge with lots of information on such judgement calls.\u00a0But given this decision, why rule it out? Why say it out loud? Why make it a matter of principle, now a doctrine?\u00a0They could simply not do it, and keep Putin guessing. That achieves the end that a U.S. finger does not pull the trigger on a U.S. weapon that sends a U.S. bullet or missile in the direction of a Russian pilot.\u00a0They could call Putin and say \"We're not putting in a no-fly zone. Don't worry, your attack is safe from the air.\" This time.\u00a0But they did not. Once again, the U.S. declares, publicly, ahead of time -- ahead of the possible collapse of the Ukrainian government -- what we will not do, and elevates it to a matter of principle.\u00a0Who else is listening? Well, Xi Jinping. And the Iranians. And the South Koreans, Japanese, Saudi Arabians, and more.Suppose, just suppose, China invades Taiwan. How does the same principle not apply? Goodbye strategic ambiguity. A no-fly zone would be a joke in that case -- if the U.S. wishes to save Taiwan it will mean attacks, not just loitering over Taiwan waiting for something to happen. How about responding with an embargo, a no-trade zone? Well, that would risk U.S. warships shooting at a Chinese ship, which would threaten a wider war. Off the table.\u00a0We have just wrapped Taiwan up and delivered it to China.\u00a0Message to Iran: test one nuclear weapon. Invade Syria, Iraq, or whatever. The US will not respond. Message to others. Get nukes. Now.\u00a0This war isn't just about Ukraine. It is about the kind of world we live in for the next generation.\u00a0Why make these public pronouncements about what we will not do? I can think of only one reason, one audience: American voters. Reassure people in the US who do not want to see greater help for Ukraine. Push up those poll numbers. For once, please, ignore the polls. Govern wisely and quietly. Only one poll counts, at the next election.\u00a0MAD was always questionable game theory. If Russia blows up a city in Europe, why would NATO murder tens of millions of Russian civilians in response? A hardy conventional response was always important.\u00a0But at least the rules of the game were clear: The nuclear threat is respected for invasions of a country that has them, or invasions of allies such as NATO. Nuclear threats do not apply to invasions of third countries. Yes, we do what we can to keep the conflict contained, often at great cost, as in Vietnam. But we do not as a matter of principle rule out any action.\u00a0***Update:Of course the swiftness and severity of economic sanctions are big news of the last few weeks. How will Xi Jinping read that? I note that much of what's going on now are private, voluntary sanctions; a general refusal to do business with Russia because so many people and corporations are rightly outraged about this invasion. \u00a0Now, what will happen if China invades Taiwan? Will people around the world see the same outrage? Even the US officially regards China and Taiwan as one country. Will they be willing to do without the much larger and more crucial amount of Chinese manufactured goods? For how long?\u00a0\u00a0These comments are not aimed at Russia. They are aimed at the local population, who are no longer treated as citizens, but a constituency to be pacified and shielded from any disturbing truths.I would hardly call it \"pacifying\" to communicate clearly to our soldiers (many of whom, including some of my neighbors, have already had their Eastern European deployments extended indefinitely) that the U.S. does not plan on becoming involved in direct military conflict with Russia, e.g. a no-fly-zone. I'm not claiming that's the wisest strategy, and as it happens, I agree with John that this is a circumstance where ambiguity is likely superior. \"But given this decision, why rule it out? Why say it out loud? Why make it a matter of principle, now a doctrine?\"Let's not be cavalier about these decisions: there are thousands of military families out there who would be much more anxious right now if Biden were less ambiguous. John, that's one reason why. Is it enough? Probably not, in my opinion. But it isn't nothing. And it's just my nearly-worthless strategic decision.I appreciate your concern, but the military is expected to operate under ambiguity, which should obviate your argument against leaving the NFZ on the table. While military families might complain about their concerns, they're neither a large nor concentrated constituency to matter in that regard, and the all-volunteer force is free to end their service at the end of every contract. Anxiety is par for the course for military families, and the successful ones learn to live with the uncertainty.How will the market react to news that escalates the war or even keeps it ambiguous? poorly. Haven't they done enough to us the last few years? To be clear, I mean the university intellectual class and politicians and their ridiculous lockdowns.  How about we sit this one out so we can afford to save for your generation's very expensive retirement, and maybe even start families of our own. Old grumpy boomers can still indoctrinate the next generation from cozy armchairs in the 2030s, for now, they need to admit they messed up (even if tacitly like Biden is doing) and need to begin accepting their retirement from the world stage.This administration is short its Henry Kissinger in these negotiations.  I fear that all these digital world people do not understand that the analog world is not the same as their digital models. In the analog world, your adversary gets a say, too.  In terms of Taiwan: it does seem as though the same principle would apply. Therefore  the issue would seem to be for the US and other countries to decide *beforehand* whether they are going to support Taiwan and if so have an official presence there so it would be *China* that risks stepping over the line to incite war with a nuclear power (or powers) and that may prevent it from doing so. It seems your frustration is that you'd like to be able to see them continue their waffling and be able to be drawn into it at a later date if needed without being blamed for stepping in and perhaps triggering a nuclear war. You acknowledge that despite thinking \"MAD was always questionable game theory. \" you imply its good that \"But at least the rules of the game were clear\". So its odd that you are puzzled about the idea of at least partial clarity this time regarding the rules (even if not complete clarity): \"Why say it out loud?... They could simply not do it, and keep Putin guessing.  \"Unfortunately the rules Putin will follow aren't clear. Its not clear whether he will view sanctions that are too harsh or the provision of weapons as a justification for attacking NATO and broadening the war. However its seems clear that any direct conflict like a no-fly zone has always been considered actual involvement in a war so it makes sense to avoid that. I suspect if Nato had troops in Ukraine or Ukraine was part of Nato that this war wouldn't have happened: but frustrated regret in hindsight of what you'd have liked to see doesn't justify increasing the risk of nuclear conflict now. I think you miss the entire point of this administration.  Your assumption that they actually care about the same things you care about is based on the false premise.  Just as one example, an administration that would seek to buy oil from Iran and Venezuela, suppress domestic production, voice opposition to the East Med  pipeline that would supply Greece and Cyprus with Israeli Natural gas is not an administration that cares about promoting the economic and strategic health of America and its democratic allies either now or in the future.  If one looks at the refusal to change course on these suicidal energy and environmental policies I can not see how one could come to any other conclusion.  No one can be that na\u00efve or incompetent.  Damage was caused by some of the reckless statements of the previous administration but this damage may be irreparable.I disagree with the deterrence logic from China's perspective. If the U.S. had said 'maybe we will fight for Ukraine, maybe we won't', then didn't fight, that would encourage China. Saying outright 'we won't fight in Ukraine' still preserves the strategic ambiguity in Taiwan.100%, surprise that we do not have more people seeing that fact, this is not about Ukraine, it is about normal world Vs world in which dictators do what they want... by not getting involved out of fear we virtually guarantee future nuclear war.. Fear is gasoline for dictators, it is drug like drug, sex and everything else.. fear fuels them... Your point on China is a good one and says something deeper about sanctions.  A sanction is not a one-way street.  The \"sanctioner\" suffers as does the \"sanctionee\".  If the sanctioner is large with many other alternative trading partners and the sanctionee is small then sanctions can work - to a degree.  When the sanctionee is your largest trading partner and a large holder of your country's debt the notion that sanctions are viable is silly on its face.  If the US even mentioned sanctions in the case of China, Xi Jingping should just laugh out loud and invite them.  Oh - OK, in that case we would like to redeem rather than roll over all the debt we are holding - ok?  How would that be for a \"sanction\"?There is a major global doctrine that should be questioned: the idea that its a war crime to assassinate heads of state like Putin. Admittedly its unlikely to be claimed: but you still have to wonder how many $billions the Ukraine government could raise from global contributors as a bounty for Putin's head in hopes it might turn insiders against him.  There are innocent people suffering in the Ukraine, and now collateral economic damage to innocent by standards in Russia and around the world since sanctions hurt both sides. @Anonymous:Where is that written? Yamamoto? One source talking about the general issue and mentioning US prohibitions on it:https://lieber.westpoint.edu/assassination-law-of-war/\"ASSASSINATION IN THE LAW OF WAR... In 1977, following revelations of U.S. lethal targeting operations and ensuing Church (Senate) and the Pike (House) Committee hearings, President Gerald Ford issued Executive Order 11,905. The order prohibited Executive Branch personnel from engaging in, or conspiring to engage in, political assassination. Subsequent administrations continued the ban. Four years later, President Regan issued Executive Order 12,333, which, as amended, remains in effect today. It contains the same prohibition, although it limits application to individuals \u201cacting on behalf of\u201d the U.S. government.\"The only purpose in declaring a \"no-fly zone\" over the Ukraine is to destroy the aggressor's assets on the ground.  At present, the Russian Federation does not control Ukrainian air-space -- it, the air-space, is still contested by the Russians and the Ukrainians.  Given that the Ukraine is nearer Russia than it is nearer the U.S., maintaining a \"no-fly\" zone against Russian air force planes over the Ukraine is logistically challenging--the U.S. air force assets in range are based in the EU and the UK at present.  To avoid entangling the EU in the proposed \"no-fly\" zone, USAF assets would have to re-base in the Ukraine, and this is not practicable.The purpose of the announcement by the U.S. is to assure the European members of NATO that the war will not be brought home to them by USAF assets returning from bombing runs in the Ukraine.  Private assurances are not enough.And, it matters not one whit whether the announcement is made privately (in the ears of the European heads of government) or publicly---the position will be known, virtually instantly, in the Kremlin.Game this out for yourself.  You're president of the U.S., and your opponent is V. V. Putin, president of the Russian Federation.  Your assets are dispersed, not concentrated; his are dispersed and concentrated.  You have B-22 bombers; he has SAMs and hypersonic cruise missiles.  He has much to gain by subjugating the Ukraine; you have very little to gain by preventing that subjugation.  He has little to lose if he fails to overrun the Ukraine; you have much to lose if the war widens and deepens to involve all of Europe, the UK, and eventually North America.  The trade analysis needs to be made in a state of sang-froid, not the hot-blooded heat of the moment.I mentioned earlier that the population of the Ukraine is 42 millions, and the adult population between the ages of 18 yrs. and 60 yrs. is roughly 10 millions, and if 10% of those 10 millions will serve in the army to repulse the aggressor, the Ukraine could field 1 million fighters.  What is lacking is armaments--small arms and anti-tank weaponry.  Given the armaments etc. the man-power ratio would then be 5-to-1 in favour of the Ukrainians.  The road from Poland is still open.  Make use of it, before you stagger/blunder into a fight that will lead to a wider and longer confrontation with Russia, and possibly China/N. Korea.  As president of the United States of America, your first responsibility is to the United States of America, and to fill that role you must harden your heart and engage your brain.  The Ukraine must do this for itself.  This is their \"trial by fire\", just as the Revolutionary War and the Civil War were the U.S.'s own \"trial by fire\" struggles.  It's worth mentioning that the Soviet Union (when it still existed) spent over 9 years (1979-1989) trying to subjugate the Afghans.  And that it is when the Soviets were at the height of their economic and political power.For context, the US Revolutionary War was 7 years long and the US Civil War was 4 years long.I don't see this war going on more than two years with continued worldwide economic sanctions against Russia.  The Ruble will become worthless, Russia will be cut off from most (all?) economic markets, and I doubt Putin will live that long.It is idle to speculate on the duration of a conflict such as the Russian Federation's invasion of the Ukraine.  The aggressor has specific objectives that he seeks to attain.  The defender, likewise, has specific objectives he must realize to remain independent.  While the conflict rages and broadens across the Ukraine, the window for compromise becomes narrower and narrower, but the prospects of resolution by the parties increase.  When will the conflict end?  This year, not later than June or July, if that long.The RUR is freely floating and transactions in the RUR comprise but 1.1% of international transactions.  The value of the RUR will be largely tempered by the dependency of the world on commodity exports from both the Russia Federation and the Ukraine.Sanctions will curtail Russian exports somewhat, but as you can plainly see in the case of petroleum and natural gas commodity exports, curtailment is problematical for the EU and europe as a whole.  Even for the U.S., banning imports of oil from Russia poses some problems (drives petroleum fuel prices higher).  For non-energy commodities, it is notable that both Russia and the Ukraine are exporters of small grains which find demand in the Middle East, and in Africa which is especially dependent on those export sources for much of their imports of foodstuffs.  For metals, Russia is a significant source of nickel and aluminum and copper--metals that are used in the fabrication of EV components, for example.  Disruption of the flow of any or all of those commodities (energy, food, and metals) is problematic for international trade and global economic growth.  Sanctioning food exports from Russia is fraught with collateral problems (destablizing Africa for example).  When one considers the source of processed rare-earth elements and the basic commodities, the western countries are not today uniquely endowed or in a position to maintain such sanctions over the long run.  Ergo, sanctions are more of a political P.R. issue than a 'lever' to be used to bring the conflict to an end. That is especially the case in the U.K. and in Canada today.Count on V. V. Putin being around and in power for quite a bit longer than any of the current roster of democratically elected officials leading the western powers will be.  The Fates are fickle that way.\"MAD was always questionable game theory. If Russia blows up a city in Europe, why would NATO murder tens of millions of Russian civilians in response?\"Why not? There was no certainty. That's enough. Nobody wanted to accept the risk.Yes, nuclear powers don't fight directly with each other. Yes, everybody get nukes.Ukraine might have been settled by 2014. We will not know. Looks like the chance is gone, and it's not worth a war to fix it.Only current hope is the unexpected incompetence of Russian forces.The word murder does a lot of work in that quote. The answer is not retaliating is surrendering. Tit for Tat is a superior strategy for inducing cooperation. Surrender just invites abuse. Weakness is provocative. \"Tit for Tat is a superior strategy for inducing cooperation\"That's probably true if you are playing a repeating game with multiple rounds. If you are playing the game only once I don't see the superiority of the strategy. Surrender is a superior one in any count (a much more desirable end game ... literally!!)@El emperador desnudo:\u201cYou were given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor and you will have war.\u201dChurchill @Fat manA conventional war is a complete different animal. We were talking about MAD, and stragegy that works until it does not.I suppose that's right in the context of a game and threats.  But I find US moves very disturbing. Mutual deterrence, another game, works by equivalent threats of execution.  Nuclear arms in Ukraine shortens the time to strike Russia. In the same way, that Russian missiles in Cuba threatened US first strike capability.  Second, we're now talking about arming Ukrainian civilians, after making clear we're not going to do anything. Not a good thing to set up untrained civilians to fight/die for a superpower's geopolitical interests, especially when it's  not fighting for them, or doesn't have that strong an interest.  US led Ukraine down the garden path, then dumped them. And 3rd, there are ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine that didn't agree to the government installed after the 2014 coup.Everybody in Washington thinks in binaries. You are all in or all out. There are lots of other possibilities. How about \"leasing\" some UAVs to Ukraine and painting them Blue and yellow. Some of them can carry missiles. Those missiles may not be able to take out a tank, but taking out a food truck or a fuel truck might be just as good at this stage. If one of them is shot down, there is no pilot for the Russians to torture. Work on the assumption that this is not an idea that has crossed the mind of anyone in the Administration whose job requires Senate Confirmation.Where is the push from the US or the EU or the \"International Community\" to resolve this conflict?  Instead, all the parties who would normally be trying to calm things down are pumping up the violence.It is clear that Russia does not want to occupy the Ukraine.  All they want is to make sure that NATO (i.e. US) does not plant offensive weapons on their border.  Given how JFK responded to the Cuban situation, Russia's stated aims seem quite reasonable.Why are we not seeing any diplomatic effort to (1) assure Russia that the Ukraine will never be part of NATO, and (2) assure the Ukraine that it can achieve the happy prosperous situation of Finland?  Does the lack of a constructive US & Western response have anything to do with the well-established corruption in the Ukraine that reached even to Biden's family?This is not to defend Russia's invasion of the Ukraine.  But we need to ask ourselves -- what other options did \"Our Guys\" give Russia when they repeatedly ignored clearly stated Russian concerns?ExactlyYou're putting too much stock in the premise that other countries believe the US consistently uses force according to set norms or 'rules'. It's hard to imagine any country taking these no-fly statements as 'doctrine' given the chaotic record of US armed forces' interventions. Obtaining nukes has been a goal for Iran and others for decades for their obvious leverage, I have no idea why this changes anything.John, you will never make it as a diplomat or military strategist.  You have taken the President at his word.  Didn\u2019t he also say he would not invoke SWIFT sanctions?...or a ban on Russian oil/gas?  And now he says \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d with regard to a ban on oil/gas.  It is all part of his strategic ambiguity; clarity is not to be forthcoming and does not serve our interest.  Putin plays chess; Biden plays poker. \u2013 What is your next move? What is your next bidding?  Let\u2019s go tit-for-tat up that escalation ladder.I think the object is to draw out the war for weeks and months.  The longer it goes, the more Putin\u2019s hand is weakened.  In a possible confrontation between two nuclear powers, there is no need for America to rachet up the escalation in only the third week of the conflict.  We will go step-by-step; we and our NATO partners have a lot more cards to play.  Ukrainians have a long struggle ahead of them.  Their liberty will be seared in blood, and it will be their sacrifice that proves victorious, and not NATO or America winning the fight for them.  Did the French win our Revolution?  [Next to our Civil War, the American Revolution was our bloodiest.]You are getting out of your lane again; your economic comments are interesting; your poly sci not so much.How are Blinken's comments about Ukraine the equivalent of a doctrine. They are statements about the level of intervention in Ukraine now.They say nothing about Taiwan other than that which is already known: we would rather not be involved but might in certain circumstances. Even in Ukraine if Russia used tactical nukes, they can have no confidence in what NATO would do even though Ukraine is not a member. The fact US Senators are even advocating for a NFZ in Ukraine now for the first time is evidence that US determination to stay out could chsnge.\"They are making a judgement that Ukraine can survive without it, and that the extra death and destruction in Ukraine is not worth the risk\"There is no way of sustaining this judgement from a utilitarian or moral perspective without sustaining that the destruction of Poland or even the US is not worth the riskYou certainly could think that the lives of Ukrainian civilians that are going to be lost in Ukraine are worth less that the lives that could be lost in a nuclear conflict times the risks of the conflict escalating to a nuclear war. And you can arrive at the same position using moral judgement.Now, in the original statement, you change \"Ukrainian civilians\" for \"Polish civilians\" or, even, for \"American civilians\" and nothing should change in your utilitarian calculations (or in your \"moral\" judgement). So, your conclusion should still be, that saving those Polish or American lives by stablishing a no-fly zone is not worth risking a full nuclear war.The only way of justifying engaging Russia to avoid Polish or American casualties but not engaging Russia to avoid Ukrainian casualties on moral or utilitarian grounds is by placing a higher value in an American or Polish civilian life than in a Ukrainian one.I find this proposition very difficult to defend from both a moral and a utilitarian perspective.Well, if NATO introduces a no-fly zone and starts shooting down Russian jets, then Russia will be shooting down NATO planes and hitting NATO airports (presumably in Poland and Romania). What's next? I guess next we will read a John's blog post asking \"Why rule out nuking Moscow?\". John, you need to treat all lives -- Americans, Ukrainians (including those who live in Donbass), Russians, Iraqis, Libyans, Afghans, etc -- equally. Basic concepts: 10 lives lost are 10 time more pain and horror than 1 live lost (no matter what the nationalities are), lives of children and women are far more valuable than lives of men, and so on. Hope you do not believe that there are people who are more equal than other people.How sane. Thank you. I would like to see same equal treatment or judiciousness with sanctions. Syrian friends suffering from US sanctions, freezing with 1 hour on/5 hours off electricity. A Russian friend from grad school whose STEM papers are now rejected bc of Ukraine. The sanctions fallout - madness of firing/deleting artists:  Anna Netrebko, Gergieve, Dostoevsky, Tschaikovsky... Minor disagreement: Syria invited both Iran and Russia, did not invite US who established base at al Tanf, confiscated oil fields,elsewhere in NE SyriaIf Putin believes the US will impose a no-fly zone and that this will lead to escalation, then Putin might not want to wait until the NFZ is imposed but may instead choose to escalate right now in response to what the US is already doing: sharing intelligence and weapons with Ukraine. If there's such a thing as pre-escalation, declaring the no-fly zone off the table could prevent it.It seems there is a supply/demand partial solution to Russia's aggression. I suspect declining oil prices, now highly inelastic, would make Russia less bellicose. The Soviet economy cratered when oil declined from $75 bbl in 1980 to $22 bbl in 1986. By 1989 when the Soviets left Afghanistan, crude oil  averaged about $19 bbl. They were bankrupt. According to the WSJ, 7% of our oil imports come from Russia. Why not increase domestic production so as to lower oil equilibrium prices. NATO and the US cannot and should not enforce a no-fly zone. Blinken as well as NATO stating that is simply common sense, both for NATO servicemen and women as well as to avoid wrong expectations. From a country that invaded other countries without any justification ('weapons-of-mass destruction' anybody?). Decisions about war are rarely about morals obviously (Saddam used to be an esteemed ally of the US as long as his ire was directed at Iran). Back of the envelope strategists can bring their vast experience in nuclear warfare to bear extending beyond Mutually-Assured-Destruction, which I just learned has not worked (because ???). \"Message to Iran: test one nuclear weapon. Invade Syria, Iraq, or whatever. The US will not respond.\"This literally happened and the Obama administration did nothing and most everyone was on board. Except it wasn't just Iran that invaded Syria and threw money and weapons and soldiers there, it was also Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Bahrain. All the while these states had plausible deniability but anyone that says they were not involved in the conflict does not deserve to have their opinion taken seriously.I'm kind of looking at everything everyone is doing to Russia right now and wondering \"we do this to the entire Middle East in 2015, is the Syrian War over in a week?\"Hello Professor John Cochrane. Completely wrong analysis. You seem to think that instead of announcing it publicly that U.S. will not enter into direct conflict with Russia, Biden administration should have privately communicated it to Putin. Have you considered the situation that the Biden administration would not be able to deliver on its private assurances, because of rapid geopolitical developments as well as capriciousness of public opinion in reaction to them. This is what a democracy looks like. The days of Dr. Strangelove or John Von Neumann suggesting nuclear strategies based on game theory are long over. So called geniuses doing dumb things. Best approach is to use democratic means to convince both sides -- Ukraine and Russia -- that there is plenty of upside in giving up the war.A principal of negotiation is to not make concessions for free.That said, from what I've heard from subject area experts, an enforceable no fly zone is not practical.\"I don't think people are seriously considering this, but a no fly zone is a de facto declaration of war... an enforceable no fly zone is a commitment to a kinetic military engagement with Russian forces.\" -- Stanford's Michael Kofmanhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4uHZPFuI1o&t=2584sIn that talk, Ward Carroll of the US Naval Institute also makes the point that combat air patrols above Ukraine would be in range of the S400 SAM sites that ring the western border of Russia. Those could be soft killed (whatever that means?), but \"the one thing that would be an act of war, if your SAMs are getting soft killed and your only response is now air to air warfare, now you're going to get one of your airplanes shot down and then your next move is to declare war on whatever country it was or NATO...\" He continues, \"... it [a no fly zone] is just not practical, and I don't think we're going to have a UN resolution, because you need that, and you need local air superiority to do it, and we don't have either of those things at this point.\"I\u2019m surprised at the shallowness of your concept of the geopolitical situation with respect to China.  The Chinese and Xi aren\u2019t like Putin and his quack cronies.  Their understanding of the geopolitical situation isn\u2019t restricted to threat / no threat.  They understand the subtleties of economics and appearances much more deeply than the Putin regime and no doubt have a more accurate concept of the relative strengths and weaknesses of their military position.  They surely recognize that, in the eyes of the US, Ukraine and Taiwan aren\u2019t remotely comparable.  The US has *very* strong historical ties across the Pacific - Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Korea, Viet Nam, Australia, numerous small island nations - and none in Ukraine.  The US would be stupid to tie down assets and resources in Ukraine that could otherwise protect Taiwan.  China understands that.   China would *rather* the US get wrapped up in Ukraine and leave Taiwan exposed.  Europe and the US should already be thinking globally.  Europe has by far the most substantial strategic interest in protecting Ukraine and the geopolitical position to do so, so it should be Europe that carries the load on Ukraine.    In this sense China and/or Russia might recognize that NATO is in some respects a ball and chain for Europe.  While the US can act independently in the Pacific, NATO action in Europe must be restricted because it would draw the US into the conflict.  But at this point Europe has no prepared means to act as a unit independent of NATO, so there is little chance of a direct military response.  I've determined you know nothing of how the FED works, (from an earlier article) now I know that you know nothing of how the world works. Seems to me you're an over educated leftist (you probably voted for that senile old grifter who currently pretends to occupy the oval office)and in these times when leftist want to destroy the U.S. that sure makes you a traitor. What do we do with traitors during a time of war???MAD is questionable. Of course. But remember, if you make a mistake, if your rational calculus is mistaken, then it is the end. So, please consider nuclear strategy seriously and take a pessimistic outlook. Any NATO intervention and we could be in this nightmare.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

From the end of World War II to 2000, US real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita grew 2.3% per year, from $14,171 to $44,177 (in 2012 dollars). Americans became healthier, lived longer, reduced poverty, and paid for a much cleaner environment and a vast array of social programs. But since 2000, that post-war growth rate has fallen almost by half, to 1.4% per year.

It's not the first, and it won't be the last on the issue!\u00a0Now that surging inflation has refocused everyone's attention on the long-ignored supply side of the economy, the question is how best to support broad-based growth, efficiency, and innovation. The answer is not necessarily deregulation, but the need for smarter regulation is increasingly apparent \u2013 even to progressives.STANFORD \u2013 The return of inflation is an economic cold shower. Governments can no longer hope to solve problems by throwing money at them. Economic policy must now turn its attention to supply and its cousin, economic efficiency.\u00a0The issue is deeper than delayed goods deliveries and a year\u2019s worth of sharp price increases. From the end of World War II to 2000, US real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita grew 2.3% per year, from $14,171 to $44,177 (in 2012 dollars). Americans became healthier, lived longer, reduced poverty, and paid for a much cleaner environment and a vast array of social programs. But since 2000, that post-war growth rate has fallen almost by half, to 1.4% per year. And it\u2019s worse in Canada and Europe, where many countries have not grown at all since 2010 on a per capita basis.\u00a0Nothing matters more for human flourishing than long-term economic growth. So, no economic trend is more worrisome than growth falling by half, especially for the well-being of the less fortunate.\u00a0The eruption of inflation settles a long debate. Sclerotic growth is not the result of demand-side \u201csecular stagnation,\u201d fixable only with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. Sclerotic growth is a supply problem. We need policies to increase the economy\u2019s productive capacity \u2013 either directly or by reducing costs.\u00a0How? The simplest and most important thing governments can do is to get out of the way. Byzantine regulations and capricious regulatory authorities stymie business. We do not need thoughtless deregulation, but rather smarter regulation that is simple, effective, avoids disincentives and unintended consequences, and is not distorted to protect current business and prop up regulatory empires.

The Chinese have used \"free\" trade to steal our intellectual capital and gut our manufacturing. All we have gotten in return is crappy cell phones and the plague. Every cent we made off of \"free\" trade has been burned to deal with the plague. It wasn't worth it.\"Free\" trade was a great idea for the UK when Britannia ruled the wave and the sun never set on the British Empire, and for the US in the aftermath of the Cold War. But now the world has gotten real again. It is the world of Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Hobbes.Trade is now a tool of foreign policy not part of economic policy. I do think we should remove all trade barriers with those of our allies that are democratic and committed to the rule of law. To me USMCA does not go far enough, and we should have similar agreements with Japan, Australia, the UK and other NATO countries.I would rather be a poor man standing on my own two feet, than a rich man on my knees kowtowing to Xi Jinping.As for your open borders idea. It suffers from many of the same defects as \"free\" trade. Yes, we need more skilled labor. No, we don't need more illiterate peasants, MS 13 members, drug dealers, or welfare drones. We also need to ensure that every able bodied American citizen has a good job at a living wage. We don't need to import workers so Hollywood executives have cheap nannies and gardeners.The \"free\" trade open borders economy has made a lot of money for urban elites who profit from investments in China and benefit from cheap domestic servants. It has devastated wide swaths of the country with joblessness, drug addiction, and hopelessness. And, it has poisoned our political and social dialog. Despite all the miracles of modern medicine life expectancies have gone down amongst the excluded classes.This is the real crisis that our idiot leftists want to label as the distribution of wealth. Piketty, like most Frenchmen is recycling the slogans of the Jacobins, 200 years after they lost all relevance. Joel Kotkin is an analyst who has a much better understanding of the nature of the crisis. Good post by John, good rejoinder from Fat Man.  A great deal of the two posts is also applicable to Australia, although things aren't as bad here, they are still moving in the wrong direction. I agree with much of \"Fat Man's Comment.  The US must have the most counterproductive immigration policy in the world.  We now have open borders that has allowed 2 million unvetted and unvaccinated illegal aliens into the country along with huge amounts of contraband.  Meanwhile we send home Indian Engineers with advanced degrees unless they can win the visa lottery.  Allowing a controlled flow of unskilled immigrants is fine to fill the jobs cited by Cochrane. But the current policy is a disaster. Think about the cost that will be incurred by local governments for years to come. On free trade, I could not care less if the US no longer produces low end cheap manufactured products but to cede our expertise in high end manufacturing to the mercantilist CCP is no longer tenable.  Some of the problem can be attributed to onerous environmental and other regs that discourages production of rare earth metals and other critical inputs and which can be rectified by reform.  It is a difficult path to get it right and industrial policy always becomes political and results in massive misallocation of resources.  Somehow a middle path needs to be found that balances free trade efficiencies with national security priorities as we face implacable adversaries in China and Russia.It is often forgotten that the benefits from a move to freer trade are net benefits. There are winners and there are losers, with the winners winning more than the losers lose. That doesn't make the losers happy.Compensate the losers. @Alan K wrote: \"I could not care less if the US no longer produces low end cheap manufactured products but to cede our expertise in high end manufacturing to the mercantilist CCP is no longer tenable.\"I should begin by thanking him for his endorsement. He recognizes that some simple things such as mining rare earths have been shut down by regulatory actions. But, I think the issues are bigger and more complicated than just giving out permits. I think that the following excerpt points out that high end vs low end does not capture the complexity of the problem:\"So let's talk a bit about the synthesis of Paxlovid (PF-07321332), Pfizer's protease inhibitor drug for the coronavirus. ... Small-molecule drugs are wonderful things ... but they have logistic complications of their own. Let's list some: ...\"That multistep work means that there are a huge variety of reagents that can be involved in such syntheses, and every new drug arrives with its own list. ... this is one of the absolutely more important parts of drug production on scale: what reagents do you need, how much, and where are you going to get them? What steps of the process are going to be done where, and by whom, and for how much money? A given drug (or its constituents) can go through two, three, half a dozen facilities in completely different countries during this work ...\"... if you track almost any drug's production down to the earliest stages, you will almost invariably come to a whole bunch of offshore suppliers. These are mostly Chinese, although there are some Indian ones and other countries in the mix as well. What they tend to have in common are lower labor and capital costs and a higher tolerance for the presence of a large number of smelly, unattractive, and sometimes downright dangerous chemical production facilities. We simply do not have a lot of that capability here in the US any more; it's been declining for decades because it's so much cheaper to have someone else do it. ...\"\"Making Paxlovid\" By Derek Lowe \u2022 5 Jan 2022 \u2022 https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/making-paxlovid \u2022 Derek Lowe has a PhD in organic chemistry and has worked for several major pharmaceutical companies. He writes a blog: \"In the Pipeline\", which is hosted on the Science Magazine website. I highly recommend it. I have learned from it a great deal about the biological science behind the plague and its treatments.The implications of this situation for national security are frightening. How can we fight a war against a country that can cut off our supplies of medicines? If the Chinese Communists take over Taiwan and cut off the supply of computer chips that run our military equipment how will we resist them?I do not claim that every step of every process must be inside the the US. Some things can be in Central and South America, and others in South or Southeast Asia. But no strategic supply chain should be allowed to go through the China/Russia Axis of Evil. We need the most searching inquiry into all of our supply chains and a policy of protecting ourselves from their vulnerabilities. Trade policy must become the servant of Foreign and Security policy.I see the immigration issue as fairly straightforward: we need more legal skill-based immigration, and less illegal immigration. It's shocking our political class cannot come to this compromise.I might go a step further and disallow immigrants access to our social benefits system for some period of time. This will reduce any misplaced incentives for people to come.Across the spectrum, there are so many win-win compromises that can't be reached because politics is broken. It's a big issue.Really, the private sector would build millions of new housing units along the West Coast if allowed. Much needed.I suspect some sort of federal bonuses for areas that move un-zoned property is needed. Tried that.

BiologyFree trade critically relies on the assumption that everyone plays by the rules and no one cheats. That assumption does not hold with China, which cheats and steals at every opportunity. Therefore, we cannot have free trade as long as China--or communist China, at least--is in existence. And firms in the West do not know this, do not put it into their prices, and are otherwise throwing money away, acting like charities.John, you state: \"But since 2000, that post-war growth rate has fallen almost by half, to 1.4% per year. And it\u2019s worse in Canada and Europe, where many countries have not grown at all since 2010 on a per capita basis.\"The following chart from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' FRED database does not indicate support for your statement (quote above): https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=MDXO .The traces shown in the chart are:Red -- Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure in Constant Prices: Total Gross Domestic Product for Canada/Population, Total for Canada;Green -- Real Gross Domestic Product/Population, Total for United StatesThe abscissa is calendar time spanning from 1962 through 2020 (time increments are annual, end of period).  The ordinate is displayed in percentage change year-to-year.There is no significant difference evident between the growth rates of real GDP/capita of the two national series.  The traces indicate that the correlation between the two countries is strongly positive.  The trend lines in both countries are essentially of the same in magnitude and direction.From this data, the null hypothesis, Ho: there is no difference between the two time series is unlikely to be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, H1: per capita real GDP growth in Canada is worst than per capita real GDP growth in the United States.What is your position on unions in general? Should they be regulated? How?I read your article dated may 12,2020 titled \"How the Fed Plans to Pay the Country's Bills\" and I have a question... at one point you say the banks can by \"flipping an electronic switch. Banks can convert reserves to cash and back at will.\" That's not how I understand fed created reserves(money supposedly created when the FED buys treasuries from a primary dealer.)My understanding is those reserves must remain within the FED system, never to be converted to cash. So, what's the real answer... are banks allowed to convert FED created reserves to cash for the purpose of lending?Reserves held at the Federal Reserve Banks can be exchanged for currency at any time when the Federal Reserve Bank in the commercial bank's city or state is open for business.  The currency so obtained becomes a \"vault reserve\", i.e., a reserve held on the premises of the commercial bank.  Currency can be exchanged for reserves at the FRB in a reverse transaction.  Handling the currency, however, requires physically transporting the currency to/from the FRB from/to the commercial bank's vaults, a costly process usually undertaken for the convenience of the bank's depositors (e.g., individuals and retail businesses that transact in the physical currency).I specified FED created reserves, ie, the FED \"buys\" treasury debt and credits the selling banks reserve account.I believe those reserves must remain in the system to be swapped when the FED returns the treasuries. Hence, no new money is created. Do you want to change your answer?\"So, what's the real answer... are banks allowed to convert FED created reserves to cash for the purpose of lending?\"Sure, by buying back the Treasuries from the Fed and then selling them in the open market (two step process).  Really!!! So the real answer is NO. Reserves remain with the FED system and cannot be converted to cash. Only when reserves are no longer reserves can the bank use that cash to \"print out of thin air\" \"loans.\"There, fixed it for you.Mark,You are forgetting something.  The Fed pays interest on reserves.  Those interest payments can be lent back out.  Principle can't be touched as long as it is held in reserve, interest payments can.Interest was never the question. The statement I objected to was that banks have an electronic switch to turn reserves into cash. Clearly, they do not... only when they are no longer reserves can they serve as basis for \"lending.\" Are you forgetting that those treasuries payed interest??? Are you claiming the FED pays more interest than those banks would receive from the Bonds??? So, NO. No new money is created. Period.No, Mark, I have no intention of changing my comments that appear above.  The description of the process of converting FRB reserves to 'cash' is correct as stated.John Cochrane's remark is famously opaque and I interpret it to be 'throw-away comment' and not one to be accorded any weight whatsoever.In a fractional banking system, the commercial banks regulated by the FRB Board of Governors (delegated) hold reserves in many forms, including but not limited to the banks' accounts with the Federal Reserve Banks around the country.Where does \"new money\" come from?  (1) Commercial bank loans to private borrowers (persons, corporations, municipalities, state and other local governments); and, (2) FOMC quantitative easing (\"QE\") programs.  In case (2) 'base money' is created when the FOMC purchases securities to hold to maturity through the committee's open-market activities.  In case (1) M2 increases.  In case (2) base money increases, which in turn increases M2.  In both cases the money supply increases.  If the FOMC decides to sell its holdings of financial assets, then the base money supply would contract, and M2 would likewise contract.  A commercial bank that holds a balance with the FRB-NY in excess of its calculated reserve requirements needed to clear its liabilities in the payments system, will rid itself of the excess balance by making loans to other banks, brokers, industrials, and non-financial corporations at various terms to maturity.  One might suppose that this is basis of John Cochrane's puzzling remark.  And, I tend to think that that is what he was referring to.Can you be for infinite growth on a finite planet, stereotypical economist and still be taken seriously? We seem to be coming to the end of the fossil fuel splurge but even should \"a miracle occur\"with more energy supply the oceans will boil with a few centuries of compound rate of growth.

If we do not fight in Ukraine now, we will fight there later, or in the Baltics, Poland, or Taiwan, at much greater cost. If we do not forcefully reverse this invasion, larger ones will follow.</p><p>The next few days and weeks are vital. If the government of Ukraine falls, President Zelenskyy and other leaders of the legitimate government will be jailed or murdered. Russia will annex Ukraine, or install a puppet government with a defense treaty. It will declare Ukraine under the Russian nuclear umbrella. Freeing Ukraine after the fact, re-creating a government, will be much harder and riskier.</p><p>Sanctions will not save Ukraine. Sanctions were intended as a deterrent. Sanctions are a punishment. Sanctions are not an effective way to fight a war. They will do little to stop Russia from winning in the next month or two. Sanctions will not achieve what must be our goal: Russian withdrawal, Ukrainian sovereignty, a return to the borders we pledged to uphold in 1994. Cuba, Iran, and North Korea withstood sanctions for decades. So will Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that sanctions have failed to deter Putin, what is the plan? On the current course, if we don\u2019t provide more help, Ukraine loses, the country is destroyed or partitioned, and we settle in for decades of deciding just how much energy Russia sells to Europe, what Europe sells in return, and how much tut-tutting we do about Russia trading with China, Iran, and others. While Putin turns his roving eye to the Baltics.</p><p>To save Ukraine, to save its democratically elected government, to save its people, to stop this from happening over and over, allies must &nbsp;fight.</p><p>We have the means. Russia does not have the power of the old Soviet Union, or of Nazi Germany. Russia spends $62 billion a year on its military. The US spends $788 billion. Germany and France spend $53 each, and the U.K. $59. NATO as a whole spends about $1.2 trillion a year on defense, almost twenty times what Russia spends. Our armies are larger, better equipped, and better trained than Russia\u2019s. We lack only the will.</p><p>News from Ukraine already suggests unexpected Russian weakness: deficiencies in advanced weapons, tactics, training, supplies, and intelligence. There is a good chance that Russia needs this to be over quickly. If this is true, it is all the more important for us to help Ukraine to hold on.</p><p>What can be done in practical terms? NATO can immediately declare a Russian no-fly zone over Ukraine. Denying Russia the skies would critically hamper their invasion. NATO can launch missiles, drones, and airstrikes at Russian army assets. NATO should move invasion forces to the Ukrainian borders. Allies could work closely and directly with the Ukrainian Army, and support their intelligence. The U.S. could unleash our own cyber capabilities. We should protect President Zelenskyy and his government. (The man is a hero.)</p><p>\u2028We cannot fight, many say, because any engagement of NATO and Russian forces could provoke a nuclear escalation. It\u2019s a legitimate worry. Putin is already capitalizing on this fear by placing nuclear forces on alert in response to sanctions. First, Putin knows the retaliation that would follow. Second, our goal is freedom for Ukraine, not invasion of Russia or regime change in Russia. Nuclear weapons exist to defend a country, not to prosecute aggressive wars, and even Putin knows that.

If we do not fight in Ukraine now, we will fight there later, or in the Baltics, Poland, or Taiwan, at much greater cost. If we do not forcefully reverse this invasion, larger ones will follow.The next few days and weeks are vital. If the government of Ukraine falls, President Zelenskyy and other leaders of the legitimate government will be jailed or murdered. Russia will annex Ukraine, or install a puppet government with a defense treaty. It will declare Ukraine under the Russian nuclear umbrella. Freeing Ukraine after the fact, re-creating a government, will be much harder and riskier.Sanctions will not save Ukraine. Sanctions were intended as a deterrent. Sanctions are a punishment. Sanctions are not an effective way to fight a war. They will do little to stop Russia from winning in the next month or two. Sanctions will not achieve what must be our goal: Russian withdrawal, Ukrainian sovereignty, a return to the borders we pledged to uphold in 1994. Cuba, Iran, and North Korea withstood sanctions for decades. So will Russia.\u00a0Now that sanctions have failed to deter Putin, what is the plan? On the current course, if we don\u2019t provide more help, Ukraine loses, the country is destroyed or partitioned, and we settle in for decades of deciding just how much energy Russia sells to Europe, what Europe sells in return, and how much tut-tutting we do about Russia trading with China, Iran, and others. While Putin turns his roving eye to the Baltics.To save Ukraine, to save its democratically elected government, to save its people, to stop this from happening over and over, allies must \u00a0fight.We have the means. Russia does not have the power of the old Soviet Union, or of Nazi Germany. Russia spends $62 billion a year on its military. The US spends $788 billion. Germany and France spend $53 each, and the U.K. $59. NATO as a whole spends about $1.2 trillion a year on defense, almost twenty times what Russia spends. Our armies are larger, better equipped, and better trained than Russia\u2019s. We lack only the will.News from Ukraine already suggests unexpected Russian weakness: deficiencies in advanced weapons, tactics, training, supplies, and intelligence. There is a good chance that Russia needs this to be over quickly. If this is true, it is all the more important for us to help Ukraine to hold on.What can be done in practical terms? NATO can immediately declare a Russian no-fly zone over Ukraine. Denying Russia the skies would critically hamper their invasion. NATO can launch missiles, drones, and airstrikes at Russian army assets. NATO should move invasion forces to the Ukrainian borders. Allies could work closely and directly with the Ukrainian Army, and support their intelligence. The U.S. could unleash our own cyber capabilities. We should protect President Zelenskyy and his government. (The man is a hero.)\u2028We cannot fight, many say, because any engagement of NATO and Russian forces could provoke a nuclear escalation. It\u2019s a legitimate worry. Putin is already capitalizing on this fear by placing nuclear forces on alert in response to sanctions. First, Putin knows the retaliation that would follow. Second, our goal is freedom for Ukraine, not invasion of Russia or regime change in Russia. Nuclear weapons exist to defend a country, not to prosecute aggressive wars, and even Putin knows that. That\u2019s why the potential for nuclear war is higher if we try to free Ukraine after Russia has already subsumed it into its sovereign territory. Most of all, if we cannot ever use our conventional military to stop an unprovoked invasion, we surrender now and watch the Century of Invasions unfold.We must not fight, others say, in \u201cforever wars\u201d in far-away countries.

Bush and his weapons of mass destruction?\"We two are not habitual hawks.\"Weren't you the one asking for a war with China to justify investment in math and science education?I agree.A no-fly zone would require the US/NATO to shoot down Russian planes. Are you (Professor Cochrane) ready for this escalation?Our founding fathers discouraged foreign intervention/entanglements, and John Quincy Adam said we should not go abroad looking for monsters to destroy. We have more than enough problems in the US including a porous border, escalating violent crime, a tattered K-12 educational system, over $30 trillion in debt, and on and on. Plus, as FRestly aptly points out, we have been lied to one too many times (Vietnam, Iraq, COVID, Afghanistan (it was supposed to be a short war that was our longest war and then our exit was tragic) just to name a few).Why not pressure the Biden administration to open up pipelines, leases, permits, and encourage companies to drill for and create energy?If the US government can pay billions for weak/ineffective COVID vaccines, then surely the US can provide incentives for companies to drill for and create energy not only for the US but so the US can reap the windfall from providing energy for Europe, rather than Putin.Under President Trump the US was energy independent, and the US was the largest exporter of energy, so we can do it again and quickly.BTW, why is the US currently importing 20% of our energy from Russia? Stop this madness and windfall for Putin!US and NATO troops could not defeat Afghanistan.How can they defeat Russia?Russia has already demonstrated their incompetence. And there's an enormous difference between defense and invasion. Could not defeat Afghanistan ... in Afghanistan. That's an argument actually in favor of the ability of defeating Russia in UkraineJohn, I've always enjoy your thoughts. What do you think of the \"realist\" position (Mearsheimer's position: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4) and how do you reconcile your thoughts with the tough facts they bring to bear?Before Mearsheimer was a realist, Hans Morgenthau was a realist.  What they both lack is the moral foundation any society must rest upon in order to sustain itself.  That created the undoing of communism in Russia because it got to the point where the people were not invested in their nation to the degree needed to compete with the West.  The same will be true for China \u2013 material wealth will bring demands from the people for more political liberty.  What will a communist political regime do then?  We are not talking about abstract idealism.  What do you think is going on in Ukraine right now?  The same thing that went on in the East Bloc after communism fell.It is not for Russia, or Russians, to determine what Ukraine, or Ukrainians, should want.   If the settlement of the Ukraine situation today were to result in Ukraine becoming neutral militarily but allowed to be democratic and join the EU and \"lean\" West (like Finland, Austria (especially in the '50s), Switzerland) would Putin accept this?I\u2019m reading several news accounts this week, like Mearsheimer's view, of how the U.S. is to blame for Russia/Putin\u2019s action with Ukraine.  They say it started with the U.S. attempt to expand NATO when the Soviet Union collapsed.  Oh really?As I recall almost thirty years ago \u2013 the mid-1990s \u2013 as we were dealing with a newly created Russia and the questioning if NATO was still needed, what shall we do with NATO?  Some of the idealistic talk was that if a new free Russia could liberalize it could join with the rest of Europe economically and a cooperative military arrangement could be made that would work with NATO.This talk was not that all idealistic; it was acted on.  While Russia was not ready to join the European Union (EU) economically, it was invited and did become a participating member of the G-7, making it the G-8 in 1997.  With upgrades to its economy, it could be ready to join the EU.Of the former East Bloc of the Soviet Union, all of those countries started their application to the EU between 1993 and 1996 and got their membership after 2000.  Russia never applied or started an initiative to join the EU. In 1999 the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland became members of NATO \u2013 none of them border on Russia proper; Poland borders on Kaliningrad which is part of Russia but separate from the main territory because it is wedged between Poland and Lithuania.  So no NATO nation was on the Russian border when Putin came to power in August 1999 and became President of Russia in May 2000.  The Baltic States and other nations on Russia\u2019s border joined NATO 2004 and after.My point is this:  Russia, in the mid-1990s, had two paths to follow.  It could liberalize and join Western Europe, or it could remain as it has historically, an East European power.  It choose the later, not the former; and when Putin came to power, he doubled down on this.  Putin had an opportunity to truly revolutionize Russia\u2019s outlook for the future; but choose otherwise.  Germany had a similar opportunity after WWII in the 1950s \u2013 to take its traditional role of a Central European power, counter-balancing its interests East and West; or turn to the West and join in an alliance.  Konrad Adenauer, the leader of West Germany in 1949, choose a new path for Germany\u2019s future.Russia lost its G-8 membership when it invaded the Crimea in 2014.  History has no subjunctive case.  Here we are.  Now what?I largely agree, though we need to be careful not to so unsettle Putin that he greatly expands the war out of desperation to hold onto power.  I do want us to strike now, if we can, as supply lines are stretched and stressed and the Russians are apparently over a barrel. The prospect of watching Russians surrender and/or retreat by the thousands is certainly welcome, as long as we don't push a desperate leader too far.Russia cannot meaningfully compete with the West in the short, or long-run.NATO countries are thugs in a back alley and can only attack weak countries. Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan...These summarize my thoughts as well. It's a grim but inexorable conclusionThere's no need for the US to intervene. The balance of power doesn't shift appreciably in Russia's favor if it wins in Ukraine, and it should be clear by now that the blood price will be substantial. As for the next wars, assuming Russia even has the resources to fight them, Poland will offer even stronger resistance and be defended by Germany, Sweden and probably UK naval and air power. We can't let issues in Europe distract us from the main security theater in the Pacific, where the US needs to unite a disparate coalition of lesser powers against a far more powerful potential hegemon.\"You have been given the choice between war and dishonor. You have chosen dishonor, and you will have war!\" - Winston Churchill to the English Parliament, 1938. After the English Parliament's 1938 appeasement in Czechoslovakia.Fascinating how history repeats itself and how short is our memory.\"You have been given the choice between war and dishonor. You have chosen dishonor, and you will have war!\" - Winston Churchill to the English Parliament, 1938. After the English Parliament's 1938 appeasement in Czechoslovakia. Fascinating how history repeats itself and how short our memory is.Xi makes Putin look like Mr. Sissypants. But America's corporate, financial and media elites do business with China.Putin=Hitler, but Xi=Confucianism.There is no money in the U.S. budget for the war. The U.S. state can no longer maintain bridges and roads on its territory. I must add, I feel uncomfortable supporting war when I am passed the typical age of a soldier and have no children in the service or eligible for service. Sending someone else's kids to die in the name of justified liberty is still hard for me to do.I think one thing worth noting, is that President Putin is not necessarily in the correct state of mind. Thus, in some sense, if NATO chooses to conduct military operations in Ukraine, this may indeed trigger Russian to carry out nuclear missile launches. If one were to assume Putin were rational, this need not be such a concern. However, given the numerous intelligence officers who have stated their position on his state of mind, it may be better to avoid any kind of military involvement in Ukraine, but pledge military involvement if other NATO nations are militarily threatened by Russia.Yes, those who have closely observed an increasingly isolated Putin over the last two years fear that he will not act rationally if his standing is at stake.but what kind of an example would military intervention set for our own corrupt despots? there is a moral hazard here, we cannot let anyone involved in corruption on our side profit from our military actions.  let the good name of the clinton family be as sullied among the corrupt as it is already among the honest. then we can at least know whether we are foaming at the mouths for war because we truly believe in it, or is it just because the \"legitimate\" government of Ukraine has spent a lot on donations to our political leaders...but I dont know...maybe I'm just under the thrall of disinformation...maybe the Clintons and the Bidens and the Bush's are all swell people and only Putin is bad.Hi John Cochrane,Even though I agree that we should be doing more, we are sending special ops veteran volunteers and there are numerous countries sending their own volunteers as well. It might not be enough in your eyes, however, with how disorganized the Russians are (they aren't even following proper military communication standards) and how many of them do NOT actually want to fight nor have proper training/strategy in how to do so effectively......I actually think it's more likely we hold Ukraine than lose it. We still hold every major city and we even have Russians surrendering to turn around and fight alongside Ukrainians against Russians now.Does more still need to be done? Yes. However, there is also a lot that has already been done and continues to be done or at least considered. Cyber warfare is being considered by Biden already and an execution of such a strategy was suggested to him on a bigger scale than ever before.This comment has been removed by the author.A few of ideas:First: The US and the NATO countries have not yet implemented a truly sweeping set of sanctions. They must sanction all imports of oil & gas from Russia. Further, we must seize all properties in New York and London that are owned by Russians of any sort. The same goes for bank accounts and other investments. We need to impose the same sanctions on Russia and Russians as we imposed on Germany and Germans during WWII.Second: The bulk of Russian troops are low skill, very young, conscripts on short terms. https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/why-the-russians-are-struggling/ What would happen if we offered any Russian soldier who surrenders peaceably, \u20ac10,000 in cash, a clean set of civilian clothes, a visa and a work permit for, and a ticket to the NATO country of his choice. I will wager that we would get a surprising number of takers. We might pay an additional bonus to any officer who delivers a whole unit. We could also pay for any arms and ammo they surrender. \u20ac1,000,000 for an MBT would be cheap. Russian MBTs are over $2,500,000 new. Heck, offer \u20ac5,000,000. Still cheaper than blowing them up.Third: There are a lot of \"contractors\" who were employed in Afghanistan and Iraq. They have some very serious skills in the military arts. We could re-up them and subcontract them to the Ukrainian military. they could be in the fight fast.Fourth: Along those lines. How about a squadron of A-10 Warthogs. Lend-lease them to Ukraine. Find \"contractors who know how to fly them. Send them to Ukraine. They can really mess up a formation of armored vehicles.John: These are free to all takers. if you like them please pass them along to H. R. McMaster. He could pass them on to his former colleagues who are still on active duty. An extension of my idea 2. We could easily justify paying a tank crew that surrenders an intact MBT peaceably, \u20ac1,000,000. The Russian MBTs are priced at \u20ac2,000,000+ new off the lot. Late model used vehicles are being sold at like new prices these days, so we could get our money back. Professor Cochrane, I agree with you. I have family in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. The city was attacked on the first night by Russian aircraft and on Saturday night by Russian tanks. The tank attack was successfully repulsed. However, I do not know how long the Ukrainian forces can hold out but I pray that they do. I had a Whatsapp message from my cousin in Mykolaiv a few hours ago saying simply \"We will win!\" My uncle is returning to Ukraine from Italy to join the fight. Even though I have family there, it is not the only reason why I support you. I support you because it is ultimately in the best interests of the US to defend democracy. My family in Ukraine is grateful to the US, the UK, the EU, Australia and Japan, and many others, for the assistance so far given but now is the time to do even more. I agree.Thanks for the interesting piece. Re \"a return to the borders we pledged to uphold in 1994\", I am a bit confused - my reading of the Budapest memorandum (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances#Content) is that the signatories pledged to respect the existing borders, and defend Ukraine in the event of a nuclear attack; but did not commit to defend those borders in the event of an invasion. Can you help me understand if I am missing something?John, You've said exactly what I've been thinking. Especially when I see that 40 mile long traffic jam of Russian tanks and armored vehicles. But in conversations I get no support. Everyone is afraid of being at war with Russia And you use an \"Anonymous\" name because?Remember the \"Flying Tigers\"?  (American volunteers assisting China when Japan's army invaded).Imagine a rogue group of A10's savaging that 40 mile column.In 2010, the people of Ukraine elected Viktor Yanukovych as President of the Ukraine. In 2014, he was violently ousted from power, leading supporters of that government were killed or imprisoned, and are still imprisoned to this day. Pro-Russia news media and Internet social sites were shut down by the force of the government. Cochrane says the current government is a legitimate, democratically elected government, but arguably that's not true at all. The current government wouldn't be in power if they hadn't recently used violence to kill or imprison their political rivals and crush their news and social media sites.Cochrane is advocating military escalation. That will inflict much more suffering on innocent people. If we shoot down Russian fighter jets, what stops further escalation? Cochrane says that choosing war against Russia now will prevent a future military conflict over Taiwan; will it? It seems entirely plausible that the opposite outcome will happen. A horrible war with Russia might reduce the will in the west to fight an even bigger war with China.Lastly, this isn't an issue of economics. Cochrane is entitled to his opinion, but has no special background or expertise that makes his opinion necessarily better than any other opinion.A good cautionary response.politepete ........ 1.  you should read politico.2.  you should examine the looting done by Yanukovych.Dear John, thanks a lot for your position. I'm from Ukraine, Kyiv School of Economics (VP for economics education). Can i invite you to give a lecture on this in Kyiv (on-line of course)You've lost your mind. It's sad to see. A no fly zone means US is shooting down Russian planes.  You're basically asking to have a nuclear power actively engaging in military conflict with another nuclear power. Seriously. Think about this. The tail risks. What % odds do you put of miscalculation/fog of war/ escalation to general nuclear exchange? 5%? 10%? You should be better than this, and I'm assuming this is heat of the moment, excessive twitter use, social desireability bias madness. But I'd have expected better and think far less of you for this irresponsible post.Couldn't agree more.  A no-fly zone means war with Russia, and yes, a double-digit chance of mushroom clouds in America.And for what?  The Russian conventional military has already proven itself pathetic.  The odds of them rolling on into NATO territory are miniscule at this point.  They know and we know that they would lose if they did. Ukraine will be the farthest west they go, no matter where events go from here.John, thanks for posting this, I could not agree more. Going to war to save Ukraine is a very hard decision, but there are times when hard decisions cannot be avoided, and the logic outlined in your piece is brutally clear. Aggression will not stop until we stop it by force. The risk of nuclear conflict frightens me, but if we signal we are the only ones who fear it, and believe Russia does not, we might as well give them back East Berlin already. Our governments are still debating how much economic discomfort we are willing to bear as we impose sanctions, hoping we can soon go back to business as usual. That ship has sailed. Our way of life is under threat, and if we\u2019re not willing not defend it, then we have already lost it. John, Elizabeth,I am still just stunned at what has transpired here, and it does remind me of Kuwait, when on the dawning day of the start of US actions in the 1st Gulf War, I found it very depressing to think \"why did it come to this\".  At the time I was on temporary assignment in Japan for Intel and my local Japanese engineers were all excited the morning the US attacks began, while I found it very heavy and depressing that it come to that point.  That said, your OpEd is spot on in that short term situation with the ongoing daily escalating Russian forces, attacks, and sieges of major Ukrainian population centers is very tense, tenuous, and at fulcrum situationally for very different possible futures.  Short term, there is an escalating humanitarian crisis for the Ukrainian population, both in already occupied and under siege population centers across the country.  Any action of the allies risks rapidly escalating events locally, regionally, globally, e.g., even just declaring and enforcing a no fly zone over Ukraine for purposes of airlifting food and humanitarian supplies would be a major risk for much greater escalations.It's a quagmire, with Putin apparently locked into the reactionary position that anything less than a captive Russian state version of Ukraine is an existential threat to the Russian state and people, something he has been moving towards relentlessly for the last 20 years of persistently resenting the breakup of the Soviet Union, and increasing alarm of the western \"allies-i-zation\" of former eastern bloc countries, even to the point he now regrets having supported US leveraging mid Asian states during a mutually interested fight against terrorism after 9/11 in Afghanistan.I have to ask myself, what would other leaders have done here?  Biden and Obama before him certainly project weakness, with any commits of real US forces on the ground always the position of last resort, which doesn't work well in the real world or in the playground in the presence of bullies.Any real escalation by the US and western allies would be simultaneous to persistent diplomatic efforts to get Putin to accept losing the war and allowing a free and independent Ukraine, which is going to be extremely challenging.  You may be right in that the time to act is here, but the risks for larger multi dimensional escalations and with significant long term deleterious effects on many fronts is also real and very challenging ground.Regards, Mike RodgersWhat does game theory say here? We have ceded the nuclear leverage to Putin. He controls the playing field in Ukraine. Belarusians, Chechens, mercenaries, may enter. Others no. What then for South Koreans and Taiwan if this is our playbook?Game theory would suggest that if Mr. Putin wants to play Wild West shootout, it's time for the \"Dead or Alive\" posters to be put up:See:https://news.yahoo.com/russian-businessman-places-1m-bounty-231620021.htmlWill any of your children be fighting the Russians for Ukraine?In 2014, Russian attack to Crimea and Donbass was not punished. True, some cocktail parties were cancelled but otherwise the sanctions were just a substitute for words \u201dnot our problem\u201d. This time Biden promised the same recipe: sanctions but definitely NO more (no force). Putin learned the lesson. And the game continues as long as we rules stay the same. See:https://news.yahoo.com/russian-businessman-places-1m-bounty-231620021.htmlHas the crowd funding site been set up yet?Will the world's first trillionaire be the guy that takes out Putin?You are assuming that Putin is rational and will not go nuclear. That's a really bad assumption. We need to reserve taking that risk for an attack on a NATO country.It is so tempting to agree. It seems pretty likely that a NATO enforced no fly zone combined with air attacks on Russian forces would have a devasting effect on the invasion. But that means many more Russian dead at the hands of US and NATO forces. Might that not strengthen Putin? The alternative of leaving the fighting to Ukrainians while providing whatever materiel they can effectively use seems superior-- especially when Russian morale is already so low you see Russian some soldiers abandoning equipment and even pre-emptively surrendering. The cost of this approach is move devastation of cities in Ukraine, but this approach still seems like the best approach in the longer run. First thought is that someone needs to buy John and Elizabeth a couple of plane tickets to Ukraine or the nearest country so they can join the fight, but leave the rest of the world out of it. I am not in favor of risking nuclear holocaust over the Ukrainian dictatorship. It is amazing how the fury of war propaganda can lead otherwise rational individuals to the conclusion that civilizations end is worth risking. While I love the USA, I am not so young as to think US foreign policy isn't belligerent. Must the USA constantly be at war with someone. 20 years in Afghanistan and all the war in between isn't enough? But this time we won't be pushing around little countries, we will be up against a nuclear power. I could go on about the stupidity of NATO expansion; perhaps looking at things from Russia perspective; the years of hating Russia over what turns out to be a hoax. Talk about mass formation psychosis over Russia and Ukraine! I find it hard to fathom how any remotely rational person could be advocating armed conflict between 2 major nuclear powers: especially with questionable and possibly unpredictable leaders in charge. Some suggest Putin has lost his marbles, while other suggest he is merely sowing confusion as a tactic so people don't guess at his real objectives. He has more room to negotiate for what he really wants if people aren't clear what the objectives are and if they think he may go further than is rational in trying to achieve them.At the same time, many are concerned about Biden's mental acuity. Even if we can hope that he defers to competent specialists and is mostly a figurehead: he is still the one officially in control and if he is truly not fully competent might perhaps be driven polls to \"look presidential\" and \"do something\" and be too aggressive were he to get the US into this.Its unclear why the US should risk any actual involvement. Its unclear if even too harsh economic sanctions might lead an unpredictable Putin to over react and pull Nato countries into this and force the US or even more minor nuclear powers into this. Great post!Simply put. We should be oppossing Russia in Ukraine, the same way that we know now we should have opposed Nazi Germany invading Poland in 1939.That simpleNot that simple.  Do you see any Republicans seeking tax increases to pay for this opposition?https://taxfoundation.org/historical-income-tax-rates-brackets/Tax Rates by year1940 - Bottom 4%, Top 79%1941 (US Enters WWII) - Bottom 10%, Top 81%1942 - Bottom 19%, Top 88%1943 - Bottom 23%, Top 94%1944 - Bottom 23%, Top 94%Instead the federal debt and inflation grows effectively taxing the bottom part of the tax bracket.\"politepete\" is correct. John starts with a wrong postulate, the Ukrainian is democratic, and arrives at a wrong conclusion -- it is worth risking a nuclear war with hundreds of millions dead. Let me add that not only Viktor Yanukovych was ousted, but his agreement with opposition leaders to stop violence and to conduct early elections signed with foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland was broken in couple days. The Minsk agreements were never honored as well. Pro-Russian politician, meaning Ukrainians who are for good relationships with Russia and for mutually beneficial economic ties, were prosecuted and sanctioned (both by the US and by Ukrainian government). Russian language was restricted/banned. High ranked Ukrainian officials openly called Russian people and Russian supporters to be second-class people. This all was in the news (not US news, of course, but it was on BBC news).  John, there is absolutely no problem with voicing your opinion in this blog post. However, for your own benefit, you ought to do some basic research instead of just relaying on American mass media:(1) Check on Wikipedia articles about Ukraine-Russia relationships, 2014 war and 2021-2021 conflict (still on-going, unfortunately), Minsk agreements, etc.  (2) It might be worthy reading about 2003 Iraqi war on Wiki and comparing the two wars (the timelines, events, casualties, etc).(3) An article on Wikipedia about the Peace Treaty of Versailles and its consequences is worth reading.(3) You might also perhaps find and read an English transcript of Putin's speech dated 02/23, in which he declares the war. Even if you do not believe any single word, wouldn't is be worthy for a prudent researcher to know what the enemy thinks? \"politepete\" is correct.

Even if you do not believe his single word, wouldn't is be worthy for a researcher to know what the enemy thinks? First, I deeply respect your opinions on economic and related issues. I am always recommending or quoting your columns to friends and family. Thank you for helping your readers make sense of confusing economic events and policies, especially via the sources you cite. Second, who with a human heart cannot join you in wishing -- demanding! -- an end to the death and destruction that Putin is visiting on Ukraine? Third, I wish for Ukraine to keep its national autonomy and the people their political self-determination. Given all that, I am wondering about your opinion of the Ukrainian election that installed the government that was subsequently overthrown by coup in 2014. Was that election rigged, and what of elections held after the coup?Putin plays chess; Americans play poker.  I think Biden has played his cards well, and is still holding.  He has been strategically ambiguous, so he has Putin guessing how far to go tit-for-tat up the escalation chain \u2013 a strategy that Obama did not want to play.First, as long as it is land armies in battle, Ukraine should be able to hold out, if not outright defeat the Russians.  The West needs to supply the Ukraine effort and give whatever other support is needed.  It is important that Ukrainians win their battle, and not others win it for them.  They can do this.Second, it is important that the Western Alliance hold together along with the rest of the international community.  Biden has done a good job on this, not going too fast for some reluctant NATO members who are now fully onboard.  Putin really miscalculated on this, as well as a number of American commentators \u2013 Victor Davis Hanson for one, as well as some of your other Hoover \u201cexperts\u201d.And third, when it comes to Putin\u2019s use of air power and missiles, I think at some point the United States especially, along with other NATO members, will have to militarily intervene.Fourth, the sanctions are working.  Because Putin invaded, the U.S. and NATO get to play with all the tools of hybrid warfare; something Obama was too restrained from doing.  There is still a lot more on the table that Biden and the Alliance have not used yet; so it is going to be drip-by-drip for a while.  Get used to it.And finally, strategically it is important for the West to stay out this militarily if it can and let the Ukrainians handle it and hopefully have a good outcome.  Putin has a disrespect for democracies, and thinks authoritarian rule is more stable than \u201cmessy\u201d democratic governance.  A Ukrainian victory, where the West stays out of it and only resorts to sanctions and other hybrid/unconventional tactics, would be a tremendous blow to Putin\u2019s ego.  And you just may get political change in Russia, from within instead of an outside \u201cconqueror\u201d.  Mourir pour Danzig?No, and Putin knows it. Everything  was fine with the West when Ukraine was part of the Soviet empire, and Putin knows it.There will be some kind of demarche to get some kind of mutually acceptable solution. My question is whether a solution might have been agreed upon before the shooting started. I do not know the answer.How about a buffer state?I do not know whether Putin would accept.This war against Russia can be won without the US firing a single shot.  Find a Treasury Secretary willing to kick gold's ass and this war will soon be over.No, anonymous Bitcoin and other digital currencies are not the solution.No, raising interest rates (and associated government interest payments) are not the solution because of the Fisher effect and because of the Ponzi limit.But since we rely solely on war dog economists for policy advice, this is the road we have been led down. This comment has been removed by the author.A no fly zone would require us to take out air defense systems, many of which are located in Russia.  Therefore, for us to provide the support you are suggesting, we would essentially need to strike the Russian homeland.Yes. No-fly-zone is a term that is great against an opponent you have beaten. This is not the case with the opponent in Ukraine. It's another term for war.We intellectuals are adept at conducting the war of words.I rarely disagree with your brilliant articles. This one is way off. Challenging a nuclear power like Putin with a no-fly-zone or similar is like poking in the eye a angry bear, with theather and tactical end strategic weapons. There is a good chance he will use them.All for what ? For Ukraine ? a semi-failed state hungry for NATO and EU money with deep historical ties to Russia.haven't we had enough of regime change or Democracy building With excellent results in Libya, Iraq, Afgnanistan and Syria. this was an awful article which reveals serious lack of analytical skills. You are relly advocating the dignificant risk of a nuclear conflict in Europe for a failed and corrupt country like Ukraine, Ukarine that only wants to enter NATO e and the UE to get access to billions of euroes and dollars of free lunches? You must be kidding...Thanks for saying this John, agree completely and appreciate the facts you presentIf we replaced \"Ukraine\" with \"Vietnam\", what would the main differences be?The US can do more and should. You are so absolutely right. Other than their nukes, Russia is nothing more than a fading, regional power. Their population is dying off, as is Ukraine's. Their army is struggling to capture positions tens of miles from their borders. Yes, it's horrible what they've done, but it's not worth America going to war. Go take a look at the German order of battle for the invasion of Poland in 1939. Their invasion force was 15 times the size of what Putin is able to muster to attack Ukraine. Ukraine vs Russia is the international equivalent of bum fights. If NATO wants to intervene so bad, let the Poles and the Germans do it.Finally, it's surreal to worry about Ukraine's borders when our own are totally undefended. Every 3 weeks, more illegals invade our country than Russia has troops attacking Ukraine.Disagree completely. Putin has finally learned that he cannot make agreements with the west (U.S.) because the west (U.S.) NEVER abides by such agreements... just ask any native american about that. For eight years he's been trying to get Ukraine to abide by the minsk accords, to no avail. The expansion of NATO is the sole cause of Putin's actions and every death there is the result of the U.S. pushing for ever more NATO encroachment to the borders of Russia.

Quantitative Easing and the Bond Market Subsidy of Prospective Fallen Angels\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1004.pdfThe Fed fails to understand that whenever wealth:gdp is high, the system will be prone to crisis (higher valuations make a flight to cash more attractive). Bailouts reward existing asset owners and creditors at the cost of keeping assets expensive for potential future owners.The American economy seems to thrive on borrowing. Even the creation of new money only occurs when commercial banks lend. The gigantic real estate sector is soaked in debt.Solutions?Make equity dividends tax free? Stimulate macroeconomic growth through money-financed fiscal programs (primarily tax holidays) and not borrowing?I think I agree with the thrust of this column, but you will have to concoct a new method for stimulating macroeconomic growth other than the build up of debt.If I understand matters correctly, there is already a huge amount of \"cash on the sidelines.\"BC,\"Solutions?\"It is a misconception that the Federal Government must borrow under any circumstance.  This misconception is perpetrated by more than 100 years of war dog economists (J. Yellen included), policy makers, politicians, and media cohorts.It is Constitutionally permitted for the US Treasury to sell equity claims against future tax revenue.  Those equity claims should be a public good (as defined by Paul Samuelson) being both non-rivalrous (my claim on future tax revenue does adversely affect the government's financial position) and non-exclusive (equity sold by Treasury is available to any US taxpayer and is sold on demand rather than as a consequence of deficits).  Understand that government bonds are a rivalrous good because of the Ponzi limit.  It is illegal for the U.S. Treasury to pay bondholder interest payments with the sale of new bonds (Ponzi finance).\"I think I agree with the thrust of this column, but you will have to concoct a new method for stimulating macroeconomic growth other than the build up of debt.\"Equity sold by the US Treasury would reduce the federal debt regardless of other spending / taxation programs instituted by the Federal Government.Irving Fisher and a group of economists proposed a similar plan (called the Chicago Plan) calling for equity financed banking and the elimination of the federal reserve as lender of last resort.What I would propose is that since the unified banking system (courtesy of Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Alan Greenspan) refused to convert their outstanding debt into equity shares back during the crisis of 2010-11, the US Treasury should take their place as the seller of equity.Larry Summers and Robert Rubin had the opportunity to institute such a program but instead chose to sell TIPs and inflation indexed bonds instead (modeled after \"Linkers\" in Great Britain).Linkers, TIPs, and other inflation linked securities suffer the same problem that traditional bonds do - they are a rivalrous good in that the returns on them to individual holders are paid from available tax revenue supplied by all tax payers.  During a stagflationary scenario where inflation rises but tax revenue falls, the payments on them can be put at risk.They (TIPs and other inflation indexed bonds) also suffer a political risk in the US.  Because the inflation indexed component on them was not legislated into existence by Congress, a future Congress (seeking to cut federal expenditures) can chose to set the inflation component to whatever they feel like (including negative values) to fund government programs.I have outlined all of this in my Blog including an augmented Taylor rule describing both monetary policy and Treasury policy rules.Ben,\"If I understand matters correctly, there is already a huge amount of cash on the sidelines.\"You understand correctly.  See:https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDDNSThe run up in demand deposits began around 2010.What that should tell you is that capitalism broke around that time and has never been fixed.And so you might ask yourself - stock indexes are near all time highs, why isn't all this money on the sidelines investing in stocks?Two reasons:1.  The 9-11 attack revealed a weakness in the consolidation of equity markets centered in New York City.  A centralized market works great but also puts up a big target for the nefarious.2. See the Ellsberg Paradox - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradox\"It is generally taken to be evidence for ambiguity aversion, in which a person tends to prefer choices with quantifiable risks over those with unknown risks.\"With publicly traded equity stocks there is a level of ambiguity / unknown risk that people may not tolerate - for instance the risk of a bunch of hijackers crippling the markets using airplanes as bombs.With equity sold by the Treasury, the risk is individualized.The best example I can give (as far as government programs) is Social Security.  Social Security benefits are a risk asset in that you may end up paying more in taxes than what you receive in benefits.And yet it is a program that has stood the test of time with bi-partisan support despite being illiquid (I can't sell my accrued benefits to my neighbor).John, this is a dangerous way to think.  Monetary policy is too blunt an instrument to punish a few bad actors without punishing the entire economy.  The Fed must provide us with nominal stability.  That's its job, its whole reason to exist.  The Fed must do this whether or not any particular company or industry shows good character.Kenneth DudaMenlo Park, CAI'm interested to know if you feel a Universal Basic Income is feasible and/or advisable?As at December 2021, some 78.5% of total federal debt is held by the American public, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  It's difficult to see how this proportion of debt held domestically presents a risk of sovereign default.Paul Singer is a speculator in financial markets. This is public knowledge. He would welcome a reduction in the number of competitors he faces daily, wouldn't you say?The Fed's mandate is price stability and full employment.  How would a financial collapse help the Fed achieve either or both of those mandates?  Paul Singer's operations might be spared, but who is Paul Singer to dictate what the Fed will or won't do in a crisis?From 2019Q4 to 2021Q3, in nominal dollars, the federal debt increased by $5.2 trillion, base money increased by $3 trillion, total reserves increased by $2.5 trillion, M2 increased by $5.4 trillion, and, nominal GDP increased by $2.3 trillion (after decreasing by $2.2 trillion by 2020Q2--a turn-around of $5.5 trillion).  Of that $5.2 trillion increase in federal debt during that period, the American public holds $5.1 trillion of it.  A little inflation is a small price to pay.The net effect of that debt increase is a redistribution of asset ownership amongst the American public. In the long-term, the federal debt will be repaid by the cohort of Americans who pay the greater share of federal taxes. That cohort is likely to be the largest holder of federal debt, directly or indirectly, as well. What goes around comes around; as Ing. Vilfredo Pareto, the Italian economist of the Laussane School noted in his population studies. This effect would not have been lost on the economists advising the White House in 2020, or the Fed economists advising the FOMC at the time.Finally, an observation:  Decisions are made on the basis of information known at the time the decision is rendered.  Hindsight is 20:20, it is said.  After the fact, we can say whether a decision was right or wrong, and punish the transgressors through word or deed, as Congressional committees often do.  But, the criticism is often of an academic character and largely unlikely to shed light on what should have been done based on the situation analysis by the decision-makers at the time in the heat of the moment. The legislation that results is, as you point out, and as I pointed out to colleagues in the investment business at the time, in the case of the Dodd-Frank bill, worse than the condition it was intended to cure.  Aside: It continues to astonish this observer that good men and women continue to seek to serve in positions of public trust knowing full well that they will be punished for it whether deserved or not.\"The Fed's mandate is price stability and full employment.\"Actually, the only Fed mandate is price stability.See Humphrey Hawkin's Act of 1979.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey%E2%80%93Hawkins_Full_Employment_Act\"MANDATES the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability.\"Notice - The direction is given to the Federal Reserve board of governors.  This is separate and distinct from the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.Somehow even supposedly well trained economist either don't understand or just ignore the distinction.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governorshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_CommitteeAnd while there is an overlap between the two groups (the 7 board members are also FOMC members), the responsibility for price stability lies with the board.The full employment mandate comes from an older Act of Congress - see:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Act_of_1946Do people read anymore?OEE,\"In the long-term, the federal debt will be repaid by the cohort of Americans who pay the greater share of federal taxes. That cohort is likely to be the largest holder of federal debt, directly or indirectly, as well.\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFRBNThe Federal Reserve banks (as holders of nearly $6 Trillion in government debt) are far and away the largest single cohort.  And so they are going to pay the greatest share of taxes?Well, gosh, why the heck are any of the rest of us paying taxes?  Just have the Federal reserve banks put a bunch of deposits in the US Treasury account and call them \"taxes\".On your 2nd post, FRestly, you have overlooked a salient fact -- the FRBs pay 100% of their net income to the U.S. Treasury.  In effect, the FRBs' marginal tax rate is 100%.On your 1st post, FRestly, you have read the objectives of the Hawkins-Humphrey act of 1978 too narrowly.  Wikipedia (your citation) states:\"In brief, the Act:o   Explicitly states that the federal government will rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve the four goals.o   Instructs the government to take reasonable means to balance the budget.o   Instructs the government to establish a balance of trade, i.e., to avoid trade surpluses or deficits.o  Mandates the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability.o  Instructs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to transmit a Monetary Policy Report to the Congress twice a year outlining its monetary policy.o  Requires the President to set numerical goals for the economy of the next fiscal year in the Economic Report of the President and to suggest policies that will achieve these goals.o  Requires the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to connect the monetary policy with the Presidential economic policy.\"The fourth and the seventh of these seven bulleted requirements ties the actions of the FRB and FOMC to the requirements placed on the government.  The fifth requirement closes the control loop on the FRBs' actions in implementing monetary policy.In other words, fiscal policy and monetary policy are required to act together in harness.  The fourth mandate is:o  Mandates the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability.To maintain long-run growth, a condition of \u2018full employment\u2019 is a requisite, for otherwise monetary policy would be less than optimal as a different monetary policy that gives rise more efficient utilization of the nations resources (including labor) would yield a higher rate of economic growth.  The physical feedback loop is personal consumption expenditures -- the unemployed consume less while placing a greater burden on government for social support and spending, ergo higher social transfers which reduce resources for productive economic growth (i.e., higher levels of taxation or government borrowing to fund transfers to the unemployed).  Fiscal and monetary policies that achieve productive \u2018full employment\u2019 increase social welfare and reduce the tax burden on productive sectors of the economy, thereby reducing the \u2018dead hand\u2019 of government.  Full employment in this sense is an implicit objective of the 1978 Act.  And, it is in this sense, that the twin mandates are understood, a.s.OEE,The problem is when government ignores it's own requirements:1.  Explicitly states that the federal government will rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve the four goals.2.  Instructs the government to take reasonable means to balance the budget.3.  Instructs the government to establish a balance of trade, i.e., to avoid trade surpluses or deficits.My point is that relying JUST on the central bank to accomplish all of these goals makes all of them difficult to achieve - which is why I isolated the explicit directions given to the Fed Board of Governors.With price stability responsibility given to the central bank, the responsibility for the rest falls upon government.If instead we want to rely solely on the central bank to achieve ALL of the goals, then it (the central bank) must get into the business of credit allocation deciding which business investments will lead to lower inflation, reduction in trade balance, reduction in federal budget deficits, etc.If we are going to rely solely on the central bank to achieve all of these goals, then we should grant them the tools to achieve them including:1.  Rejecting private loans to companies / individuals that offshore their tax liability or simply dodge any tax liability.2.  Rejecting private loans to companies / individuals that speculate on the price of commodities and other raw / intermediate goods.3. Rejecting loans to the federal government itself and any bank / business that purchases bonds issued by the federal government.OEE,\"On your 2nd post, FRestly, you have overlooked a salient fact -- the FRBs pay 100% of their net income to the U.S. Treasury. In effect, the FRBs' marginal tax rate is 100%.\"No, I didn't overlook that the FOMC can CHOOSE to either pay the interest payments that they receive from the federal government to banks as interest on reserves or they can CHOOSE to return the interest payments to the Treasury.  There is no legal mandate that the FOMC must return interest payments back to the Treasury.  The FOMC's marginal tax rate is whatever they want it to be.\"To maintain long-run growth, a condition of full employment is a requisite, for otherwise monetary policy would be less than optimal as a different monetary policy that gives rise more efficient utilization of the nations resources (including labor) would yield a higher rate of economic growth.\"The point of my post was this - relying SOLELY on the central bank to achieve multiple economic objectives (for instance balance of trade and budget) is a recipe for trouble.In the somewhat hypothetical, if the federal government set the age at which you begin receiving retirement benefits at age 45 instead of 65, how close do you think you would get to full employment REGARDLESS of what the central bank does?If you are going to rely SOLELY on the central bank to achieve multiple economic goals, then the ONLY way that happens is for the central bank to pick and chose which loans will result in higher employment, lower trade deficit, etc. - aka, credit allocation.Do you have evidence that the federal government is not relying primarily on the private sector to achieve the four goals?I stress again that you are interpreting the language of the Acts too narrowly.  You have emphasized that the government is \"- relying SOLELY\" on the FRB \"...to achieve multiple economic objectives (for instance balance of trade and budget)... .\"  How do you arrive at that conclusion?Then, \"... if the federal government set the age at which you begin receiving retirement benefits at age 45 instead of 65, how close do you think you would get to full employment REGARDLESS of what the central bank does?\"  The real world example that fits your hypothetical scenario is Malaysia in the 1990s.  The retirement age was set at 55 years of age, and it didn't  negatively affect \"full employment\".  Indeed, the government's policy was intended to promote full employment by forcing older workers out of the workforce when they reached the official mandatory retirement age, thereby opening positions to younger workers at a time when the Malaysian demographic statistics were highly skewed to the young.  But that is government policy working through the private sector, not the central bank.The concept of full employment does not imply that there will be no unemployment.  In any event the term \"full employment\" does not appear in the 1946 Act or 1978 Act. \"Full employment\" is just a short-hand way of describing the neutral rate of unemployment -- i.e., the level of unemployment at which the price level neither increases nor decreases, ceteris paribus.  You will recognize this as the \"Phillips Curve\" effect.  The parallel concept is the 'neutral rate of interest' which is that rate of interest that neither accelerates economic growth and thereby lifting the rate of inflation, nor decelerates it giving rise to deflation.  This is a Wicksellian concept, though the term Wicksell used was \"the natural rate of interest\" and it applied to the private sectors' cost of capital--if the bank rate exceeded the natural rate of interest, recession resulted, but if the bank rate was below the natural rate of interest, economic expansion resulted.  At the natural rate of interest, growth was steady and the private sector earned its cost of capital.  The concept of inflation was worked into this conceptual model, and employment followed the normal course--rising during economic expansion and falling during recessions.The trade balance depends on private sector competitiveness and government policy (excl. of the central bank, though the bank rate has an impact on the rate of foreign exchange which affects the balance of trade to a degree).  A country whose currency serves as the World's reserve currency will inevitably run a trade deficit.  Discontinue the USD as the World's reserve currency if you would rather run a trade surplus.Your last point is germane. Since the central bank does not engage in credit allocation decisions in normal economic situations (financial crises being excepted as being non-normal situations), we can infer, on the basis of this criterion, that the FRB is not being relied upon solely as the agent for the government to attain \"the four goals\".I now punt the ball back into your court.OEE,\"Do you have evidence that the federal government is not relying primarily on the private sector to achieve the four goals?\"Government stimulus checks?Have you had your head stuck in the mud all of this time?\"The retirement age was set at 55 years of age, and it didn't negatively affect full employment.

Problem solved!!! Anyone over the age of 22 that is not working is considered retired.\"  If you say so.  The example of Malaysia was presented in response to your earlier remark, and not a recommendation for the USA which has the opposite problem--i.e., a population demographic which is increasingly weighted towards the elderly and an insufficient proportion of younger working age adults.\u25cf \"Not really. See John's statement above:  \"This is absolutely wrong. (Bold  ... .\"\"  John Cochrane's statement pertains to \"moral hazard\", i.e., the negative externality imposed upon society by private sector actors who rely on limited liability to avoid shouldering the consequences of their actions when the market moves against their leveraged positions and the Federal Reserve and the federal government are forced to step in to stop runs on the financial intermediaries that result from those actors' behavior. He is speaking from the perspective of a general tax payer whose future income and wealth will be burdened by government taxes and/or inflation arising from the government's and/or the Federal Reserve's support to the markets.  His remark does not speak to credit allocation by the Federal Reserve System, per se.\u25cf \"When you understand that a government Treasury can sell equity in lieu of debt / bonds, then everything else falls into place\" This is your conception of a security that the U.S. Treasury could, theoretically speaking, utilize.  For its effectiveness, it relies on the private sector to take up the hypothetical securities, as we've discussed previously.  It is not a security that the Treasury has issued up to the present time.\u25cf \"Nope, incorrect. The dollar has been the world's reserve currency since the Bretton Woods agreement.\"  The USD was not the world's reserve currency at the time of the Bretton Woods agreement (July 1944).  The Bretton Woods arrangement became functional in 1958.  The agreement pegged the value of the USD to gold at $35/troy oz.  A currency peg to gold has straight-forward dynamics that require the country pegging to gold to maintain a positive or neutral trade balance.  If that country runs a trade deficit, then it must either close the trade deficit and run a trade surplus or it must raise its interest rates to attract gold to it, or lose its gold reserves.  The agreement collapsed because the US wasn't prepared to discipline itself to maintain the peg.  France which was running a trade surplus with the US at the time demanded gold in exchange for dollars; Nixon then broke the peg because the US had printed more dollars than there was gold in Fort Knox to back those dollars.  It took until 1971 for the system to break.  Nothing happens overnight.\u25cf \"I have explained this to you more times than I can count.\"  Scolding now?OEE,\"Government stimulus checks? -- I would say that the transfer payments made in 2020 and 2021 are not evidence that the government is not relying on the private sector to achieve the four goals.\"What in your mind would be evidence?\"...and the Federal Reserve and the federal government are forced to step in to stop runs on the financial intermediaries that result from those actors' behavior.\"No one \"forced\" Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, etc. to convert bank debt to Treasury debt - who are you trying to kid here?

Has this country been at war for so long that the fields of economics and public policy have become entirely enshrouded in the fog of war?The Chicago Plan was proposed in 1933 by Irving Fisher, et al., and answered in 1935 in the negative.  It was resurrected in 1939, and then shelved.  It was again resurrected in 2012, with modifications in a working paper published by the IMF, but never gained traction.  In 2019, Christine Lagarde dismissed it, saying that she was not convinced \"that eliminating the role of private banks in the supply of \u2018broad\u2019 money is a good idea\".  [Wikipedia: Chicago Plan] John Cochrane, in this blog space, has promoted \"narrow banking\" (essentially, The Chicago Plan of Irving Fisher, et al.) while noting that the FRB has rejected every application for 'Narrow Banks'.  Your \"Government Equity\" concept is hypothetical in nature.  It requires a taxpayer who is willing to purchase forward contracts from the IRS, i.e., pay cash money, to pre-pay a future uncertain tax liability some n years ahead of the liability's due date.  It is not the Chicago Plan.  It would not raise money in any situation like that which occurred in late 2008 and 2009.  The players then were not regulated commercial deposit taking banks, but were unregulated or self-regulated 'investment banks', and hedge funds and insurance companies.  Contrary to your assertion, the two alternatives facing Paulson and Bernanke at that instant were (1) to provide unlimited access to federal funds (Treasury or FRB) or (2) allow the U.S. financial system to work it out for themselves without federal assistance at the risk of significant damage to the U.S. financial system collectively and to the reputation of U.S. government.  Hindsight is 20:20 and you are applying that normative standard here in your remarks.What I stated viz. \"Government Equity\" (\"GE\") was (a) I'm not a buyer, and (b) you haven't had any success in convincing the Sec. of the Treasury or the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank System to buy into it and present it to Congress for approval.  I pointed out the inherent risks that GE (as first described by you in this blog space) presented to a potential purchaser and why I thought that it would not be an attractive proposition to a business owner.  I haven't troubled to follow up on your latest variation on GE, so you may consider my views to be 'out of date'.  Be that as it may be, there is no likelihood that GE will be adopted by the Treasury anytime soon, in my humble opinion.As to the Chicago Plan, forcing commercial banks to reduce their loans outstanding to the level of their book equity plus deposits--i.e., eliminating fractional banking in the U.S.--would lead to an economic depression presaged by widespread bankruptcies and considerable population dislocations.  John Cochrane's support for \"Narrow Banks\" (no fractional banking) is limited specifically to bank charters for new banks (essentially 'savings and loan' companies, or 'trust companies') that can only lend up to 100% of their reserves held in the Federal Reserve Bank System or as vault reserves (cash, bullion and species).  The point of these new 'Narrow Banks' is to access the FRB's federal funds rate or interest on excess reserves (\"IOERs\"), and not as sources of new loans although that is not necessarily precluded. 'Narrow Banks' would not be able to compete against the regulated fractional-banking system banks for loans and deposits (which come with those loans and other services).As to the question, \"What in your mind would be evidence?\", my reply is that I am not the one challenging the status quo--it is up to the challenger of the status quo to prove the validity of his thesis, or give it up.Seems to me the Fed needs better tools, if they can be engineered. You know the saying - if you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail: pandemics, wars, climate threats, natural disasters. But maybe liquidity is the best hammer/tool in the toolbox. I've often wondered if 5/5/5 is an economic sweet spot: 5% UNRATE, 5% FFF, and NAIRU = 5%. It worked pretty well through the 1990's until a bunch of economists thought it was a good idea to fund a bunch of investment bank bailouts and never-ending wars on the cheap.https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFFPowell's job was to control the money stock so as to control inflation.  But Powell continues to buy bonds, he removed Reg. D restrictions on savings' withdrawals, and he eliminated reserve requirements.  Powell hasn't reversed anything he unleased and inflation is at 40-year highs.The truth is probably closer to, if the fertilizer had been allowed to hit the fan, the economy would briefly have tanked. Pols and voters would have seen that the price of COVID panic was too high and gone back to business as usual. By now the US economy would be back on course with the reversal showing as only a brief dip in the rearview mirror. The doubtless well-meant rescue measures have only succeeded in multiplying the misery, and extending its timescale for  decades to come.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

In Germany I can't wait to see how the battle between climate activist and conservationist over wind turbines unfold.Once you enter the realm of the \"political market\" any costly stupidity can happens (a risk that it is only mitigated by the fact that, most of the times, nothing happens given the \"veto power\" of so many constituencies in this political market)https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/17/germanys-plans-for-wind-power-are-dauntingly-ambitiousEnjoying the coverage of these energy snafus! The root of the opposition to energy / infrastructure at large is an anti-human philosophy, that views human action or impact as being evil as such. Notice how there is ALWAYS a reason for opposition: whether the trees, the butterflies, the bats, the sturgeon - all take priority over human existence and what human existence requires. \"For now, we burn gas to make electricity, then send it over nonexistent power lines to turn the electricity into heat, at about half the efficiency of just burning it at home.\"Heat pumps are a thing FYI. It's usually more efficient to burn gas in a turbine to make electricity to power a heat pump, than burning it in a boiler.

When I was editor of The Journal of Law and Economics, we published a whole series of studies of regulation and its effects. Almost all the studies\u2013perhaps all the studies\u2013suggested that the results of regulation had been bad, that the prices were higher, that the product was worse adapted to the needs of consumers, than it otherwise would have been. I was not willing to accept the view that all regulation was bound to produce these results. Therefore, what was my explanation for the results we had? I argued that the most probable explanation was that the government now operates on such a massive scale that it had reached the stage of what economists call negative marginal returns. Anything additional it does, it messes up.The whole interviewhttps://reason.com/1997/01/01/looking-for-results/Just pray fusion works. And if not that, magic and chanting. Comments are welcome.

Isn't the economic driving force, the fact that Americans will pay more for the electricity? I suppose some bureaucrat will get a warm feeling as NY moves closer to their 70% goal, but from the standpoint of carbon emissions, this project is nonsense, because of transmission losses.Couple of potential reasons. IIRC they have a surplus. They want to expand one way or another. New York City is a metropolis that's relatively close to Qu\u00e9bec. Aside from the red tape, the national political border doesn't make it further away physically. NYC may be willing to pay more or pay it sooner than the other nearby places the power provider could export to. Someone can correct me if I'm off-base here, but would replacing NYC's current 'less-than-green' power sources with surplus from a hydropower plant still be nonsense from a carbon emissions standpoint, even with transmission losses?I live in a country with almost all rivers blocked with dams. And we have no migratory fishes anymore. It is a bad trade off, I'd take nuclear over that any day.

If we have complete surveillance and control, political \u00a0liberty goes out the window.\u00a0Just found your blog. Interesting reading & great to hear you.Here's how the priorities should work:1. Human rights (right to body)2. Contract rights (right to collaborate)3. Property rights4. Political rights (ability to affect policy toward others)These are implicitly commandments 6-9. You don't have effective property rights unless theft is prosecuted, contract rights unless violation is prohibited, or human rights unless murder is prosecuted. Similarly, if abuse of the political system is permitted, the political system loses its legitimacy and we effectively lose political rights too. Excellent synopsis. Thx. Especially grounding our rights in Scripture. Rational governance is Supra-rationally grounded in the ineffable. Hobbes, like Machiavelli before him, promoted the idea that monitoring really does matter. And, like North, institutions restrict an option set, not by virtue of the probability of being caught, but the certainty of it. The US government shut down railroads strikes in the late 1800's because rail cars were being used to transport US Mail. So there's a precedent in the US for shutting down protests that interfere with government business and general commerce. I'm not sure what the equilibrium will be with digital commerce when it comes to enforcement. With fintech, all transactions can be harvested and flagged based on who writes the algorithms and for what purpose. This makes the MC of fighting corruption potentially very low, but with unknown externalities. \"Weapons of Math Destruction\" by Cathy O'Neil does a great job of exposing how algorithms can be used to punish and restrict economic activity and opportunity. Regarding crypto - I believe the Treasury dept has been laying down some regulations for transactions on Crypto Exchanges as a means to monitor wealth creation. How it could be used to monitor potential criminal activity is another matter. Converting crypto to whatever fiat currency still requires some work, but the lineage of transactions being anonymous presents issues. Surveillance capitalism isn't just on the social media side: it'll find its way into transactions, too. Already recommender engines use transaction logs to suggest more stuff to buy. Can build a preference model of that data, along with search. \"You can run, but you cannot hide.\"John,\"This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto.

The answer is that you must migrate away from your thinking about transactions in terms of two parties and move toward three party transactions.  That third party can be government but does not need to be.In a two party transaction it takes the mutual consent of both parties for the transaction to take place.P1 - No, P2 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes - Transaction happensIn one of four (25%) cases, the transaction takes place.Contrast that with three party transactions:P1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensIn 4 of 8 cases (50%), the transaction happens.Markets are INEFFICIENT because they rely predominantly on two party transactions.Samuelson and Fama are incorrect.No-one is going to want to participate in a system where any two parties can conspire to force a transaction on an unwilling third party, which your example implies.If all three parties have to agree, then the transaction occurs in only 1 in 8 cases (12.5%). But, that's irrelevant: the probabilities of the 8 cases are not equal; they depend on expectations of value creation.Anonymous,\"But, that's irrelevant: the probabilities of the 8 cases are not equal; they depend on expectations of value creation.\"The probabilities on the 4 cases in a two party transaction are not equal either; they also depend on expectations of value creation.The point of the exercise was to do an apples to apples comparison of two party and three party transactions.\"No-one is going to want to participate in a system where any two parties can conspire to force a transaction on an unwilling third party, which your example implies.\"Do you live in a cave or on some deserted island?See prosecutor (party #1), jury (party #2), and defendant (party #3) in any criminal proceeding.Or see taxation for that matter.  Can two parties (elected representatives and other voters) conspire to force me to pay taxes?  They most certainly can.  I will have a vote in the matter, but as with my three party example, I may get outvoted.John,\"This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto.

In the two-party transaction example, in 1 of 4 combinations, 25%, a 2-way transaction occurs.  In the three-party transaction example, in 1 of 8 combinations, 12.5%, a 3-way transaction occurs.  The conclusions expressed in the penultimate and the ultimate sentences bear no relation to the examples given.OEE,Check your reading comprehension skills.In the three party transaction, I am relying on majority rule (2 votes out of 3) for the transaction to take place the same way that I am relying on majority rule in a two party transaction (2 votes out of 2).  With three party transactions, that occurs in 50% of possible voting outcomes.The point is that there is a trade off between economic efficiency and economic freedom as illustrated by the example above.Two party transactions provide the most individual freedom but are the least economically efficient.Three party transactions sacrifice some economic freedom (you may vote no on a trade, but be outvoted) but are more economically efficient.Robert Mundell (your fellow Canadian) made a similar observation regarding currency exchanges here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_problemFRestly,My remarks referred to your statement:\"It's not really that hard a question to answer. The answer is that you must migrate away from your thinking about transactions in terms of two parties and move toward three party transactions.

If you are relying on bi-lateral arrangements to make your point in criticism of John Cochrane\u2019s remarks, then my observation serves to point out that you have, in your enumerated examples, ignored \u201cthree party transactions\u201d, i.e., A-B-C (tri-lateral) vs. A-B (bi-lateral).The Wikipedia page refers to currency trading pairs (bi-lateral) but notes that Mundell\u2019s observation does not hold for currency trading triples (tri-lateral).I trust that this explanation will serve to clear up any misapprehension.OEE,\"Your examples all refer to bi-lateral arrangements (transactions in terms of two parties)\"Again, check your reading comprehension skills.From above:P1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction does not happenP1 - No, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction does not happenP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - No - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - No, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - No, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 - Yes, P2 - Yes, P3 - Yes - Transaction happensP1 = Party #1P2 = Party #2P3 = Party #3In 4 of 8 cases (50%) IN THE THREE PARTY VOTING ARRANGEMENT, the transaction happens.Using the above:For two party transactions - 25% of potential trades take placeFor three party transactions - 50% of potential trades take placeIn an n good barter economy:For two party transactions there are n*(n-1)/2 combinations of two goods that can be tradedFor instance with goods A, B, C, and D there are the following combinations:AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD : Total of 6 combinationsFor three party transactions there are n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6 combinations of three goods that can be traded.For instance with goods A, B, C, and D there are the following combinations:ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD : Total of 4 combinationsIf we allow all possible trades to be voted on, then in a barter economy with two party transactions the average quantity of lots of goods that will be traded can be calculated as follows:2 * n*(n-1)/2 * 25% = n*(n-1)/4In a four good barter economy with two party transactions an average of 4*3/4 = 3 lots of goods will be traded.If we allow all possible trades to be voted on, then in a barter economy with three party transactions the average quantity of lots of goods that will be traded can be calculated as follows:3 * n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6 * 50% = n*(n-1)*(n-2)/4In a four good barter economy with three party transactions an average of 4*3*2/4 = 6 lots of goods will be traded.It should be obvious that n*(n-1)*(n-2)/4 is always greater than n*(n-1)/4.John, blocking bridges with trucks is not speech.  Is the Canadian government trying to silence people, or are they trying to protect people's freedom to transact from disruptive behavior?Hopefully, if the executive branch abuses its power and silences protected speech, the judiciary will step in.  If the Trump era has taught me anything, it's the importance of an independent judiciary, a key protection for political liberty in a world where the government has complete surveillance and control of electronic transactions and everything else.Kenneth DudaMenlo Park, CACanada is a different kettle of fish.  I don' think they really have an independent judiciary.  Here in teh US most judges are stooges of the Democrat-Progressives.  Earl Warren's SCOTUS showed us that judges are mere autocratic bureaucrats in black robes, effectively a second unelected legislature relying on sentimental fools to stay in power.  The current judicial \"system\" in the US reminds me of the last days of the Parlements of France under the Ancient Law of France--which got abolished during the Revolution and replaced with the Code Napoleon.  The Restored Bourbons in 1815 kept the Code Napoleon and the revised courts; the old Parlements were premanently gone.  Read \"The Black Count\" to get some feel in passing what the Ancient Law of France was like in practice--one of its Maxims was \"There are no slaves in France\".  The First Republic for a few months even tried to make slavery legal in Revolutionary France!Superb comment, John. Those of us who warned about \"soft totalitarianism\" on the campuses of the 1990's are seeing our fears realized. It is important to note the \"finer points\" of the strategy employed by Mr. Trudeau. His minister is threatening to freeze bank accounts of those connected with the trucker protest, but the minister refuses to specify how many accounts, or what criteria would be employed. Moreover, one article stated that lists would be turned over to banks, and it would be the banks' responsibility to determine who would be frozen. This allows Mr. Trudeau to evade responsibility, while terrorizing anyone who might disagree with him. Cost-conscious bank executives might decide to simply cancel the accounts of anyone on the list. Mr. Trudeau missed a golden opportunity to bring Canadians together by (a) meeting openly with the truckers, and (b) finding a compromise solution. Anyone marginally more competent than our current U.S. President could have done this easily.This comment has been removed by the author.This is the first I've heard of runs on banks, which I thought would be all over the place after the government promised to \"do more.\"  Either it's not happening much or the news of it is seriously being squelched?  (Or I'm not reading the right news sources, also a very likely possibility.)Remember, the other reason why governments license businesses and individuals (besides revenues) is this gives them control over your livelihood and the ability for you to provide for your family.  This is incredible leverage and just what they want. Maybe so. But the alternative is anarchy, which in its purest form is severe idealism: that people can self-monitor their behavior and the natural by-product is everyone gets along and there are no violations of property or to others. Uh-huh. Maybe it's possible in a 2 person society, but even Adam and Eve had issues.Mark,See above:\"This is going to be a hard question as we move to electronic transactions, whether fintech or crypto. If we have arbitrary, cheap, completely anonymous transactions, tax evasion, theft (ransomware), fraud, can go haywire. If we have complete surveillance and control, political  liberty goes out the window.\"Professional licensing provides a level of accountability with the veil of anonymity lifted.  Do you really want a doctor using a pseudonym performing surgery on you or a lawyer using a phony name representing you in court?Mykel,\"Maybe it's possible in a 2 person society, but even Adam and Eve had issues.\"Adam and Eve had God around (3rd party).If I were a Canadian I would be looking to migrate, quickly. Just where to go?It certainly wouldn't hurt Oz to inherit a few freedom lovers, with a backbone. Ours could use a bit of reinforcing about now.John, I think what you mean in this sentence is \u201cprivately\u201d, not \u201canonymously\u201d :\u201cAnd the right to transact, freely and anonymously. If the government can monitor your transactions, freeze your assets, \"sanction\" you, or freeze your ability to transact, to buy or sell anything, it can quickly silence you, stop your political participation, undermine political movements or even aspiring individual politicians.\u201d Anonymity has never been a right. Privacy, or even secrecy, has a much stronger foundation.In digital tech this is a big difference. A big part of the problem with today\u2019s digital structures is anonymity.Digital privacy is an achievable goal but it does require a validation authority. Unless one believes in a world without passports, there needs to be a way to establish identity beyond a reasonable doubt. Creating that value also enables privacy because it enables individuals to encrypt their data with their digital identity.The state has a unique role in strengthening citizen freedom through private validation of identity. That will need to be recreated in the digital realm to deliver the same value in the digital as exists in the physical.This is a very good point. The best I can come up with are private payments processors, backed by treasurys or reserves, that maintain customer privacy. Government can search with a warrant, and immense legal protections. An imperfect middle, to be sure. Maybe this will help crypto go more mainstream. I am Canadian, and while I didn\u2019t donate to the Convoy, I almost did. I have donated to other causes (generally free speech related) that the current uber-woke Canadian government might find \u2018offensive.\u2019 So I would like to move my money out of Canadian banks. Crypto is attractive for that reason\u2014but solely for that reason. I do not want to speculate in crypto, and the less I need to learn about it the better. I just want to use it as a medium term store of value that is safe from the Cdn gov\u2019t, ideally with a rate of return that is comparable to what I can earn in standard mutual funds, or a bit lower as the cost of security from government. If someone sets up that institution, there will be a lot of takers. (If it is already possible, please point me in the right direction.)Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

Thanks John, great post.Best question of the day:  \"If 'markets' aren't 'valuing' green investments correctly, isn't it remotely possible that they are valuing them too much?\"But \"central planners of the economy\" do not understand their own limited knowledge horizon, and their power assures us their guessing-mistakes will hurt the evolving economy much more severely.  The Social Cost becomes gigantic from the illusion of \"planning.\"  Why not just boost the capital requirements of the coddled bankers (with access to the Fed).It's strange how people do not realize how ironic this affirmation is, as you did. How can one not sarcastically propose that the fed is better at evaluating risk than the whole of the financial sector? And if you believe this how can you be against revolving doors? We need those fed magicians working at the banks!Given the point of the Fed is to disrupt the proper functioning of financial markets, perhaps they are best positioned to foresee such risks?One of the ways the Fed adds money into the economy is by losing alpha.John,\"I should have added: there is no such thing as an orderly price adjustment.

On the bright side, the focus on vaccines since early 2021 has been relentless. Someone has to be commended for that. If we had vax rates close to that of Denmark or Portugal, the number of deaths would be much lower. The current number is heartbreaking, as is the suffering of the families left behind. I don't know how diluted the focus on the vaccines has been by policies on masking, testing, etc. Things are not mutually exclusive, so I think the effect has been minimal and vaccines remain front and center of the public health strategy. Of course, the focus on vaccines could be even clearer, but not sure hesitancy would be lower with more aggressive efforts on that front. And at least we do not have people in positions of power at the Federal level questioning the efficacy of the vaccines. That would have been a bigger problem given how effective vaccines remain. Cheers.Seems like every nation ends up losing against Covid-19. Testing, testing, vaccinations, lockdowns, no lockdowns, masks what have you, it all ends up in the same place.If I am doing my math correctly, the latest strains of Omicron are 200 times more infectious than the original virus.

Sorry to be slow on this. I kept thinking the comments were going to another post and couldn't figure out the problem. Now fixed. Why am I not surprised? It has always been and will remain that someone's need will be someone else's opportunity. You also make clear the point that, in the end, it is the consumer/taxpayer who foots the ultimate bill. If we want cheaper health care, someone's ox will need to be gored. Either consumers will need to accept a lower (less costly) standard of care, or health care providers, pharmaceutical companies, etc., will need to earn less. Without serious federal government action, it seems unlikely that the cost side of health care will fall anytime soon.The pandemic has also made clear that our current health care system operates on a \"just in time\" service basis. It works as long as the demand is not too high, but in the case of a broad based emergency, that model can quickly break down.Could be time to go with herd immunity. (Trump was right.) With the less deadly viruses, especially.  And if unvaccinated folk perish, it was time to cull the herd of stoopid Libertarian Republicans, in any event.  In France a PCR test is free for the citizen (you don't even need to bring a payment method) and the lab charges 40euros to the state.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic.

You could even go so far as to say that political parties have utility functions, and describe the utility functions based on policy choices they make.  You might even observe that politics is about divying up the pork in the 'pork-barrel'.  Indeed, you could draw on an old aphorism that dates from the Era of Trusts, to observe of today's 'progressives', \"If you can't buy [or, brow-beat and bully] a congresswoman, what good is she?\"The real failing is not on the side of the democratic party senator or representative, but it is on the side of the republican party senator or representative who falls for the con.In the parlimentary model of govenance, to be on the opposition side of the aisle is to oppose the government at each and every instant and instance.  The republican form of government seems to abhor such practices, focussing on cooperation, bi-partisanship, and other forms of compromise.  The other side of that coin is the practice of wholesale turnover of the bureaucracy whenever there is a change of party in power, in conjunction with partisan political appointees up and down the civil list.  You re-start from zero every four years.  It's no way to run a railroad.You can do little about the form of governance, but you can do much about who is given the reins of power.  The old adage, \"Vote early, vote often\", has its place in that pantheon.As to federal highway spending, the keys to the citadel have landed in the hands of those who disvalue rural communities, economic efficiency, and republican constituencies.  Grin and bear it, for the time being.  Your chance will come around, a.s.Dont worry Ill, along with plenty of voters, will vote often and democrat when were dead.Bring back earmarks. The executive branch cannot be trusted to pick good projects. Congressmen know what their constituents want. They should write into the legislation so that they don't get horsed around by bureaucratic dip wads like these.Personal automobiles are the most inefficient (particularly in terms of space) way of moving humans. Weird an economist would push for more of it when historically investment in it has been so lopsided compared to alternatives. Fix what we have, but if you're serious about moving people or goods, the the most rational electric vehicle investment for America would probably have an over head wire and run on steel tracks (trains, subways, trams).My car gets me door to door at any time I want. Public transit does not. Relative to its modal share, we spend far too much in transitBecause parking for private vehicles is severely underpriced. Private automobiles are essential for suburbs, and America's suburbs are the reason that the U.S. is not facing imminent demographic collapse, like Europe, Japan, China, etc.\"I found the original memo here. (WSJ, why do you not link to sources?)\"I've long wondered why they don't. Journalists want us to trust them but I'm a little low on trust these days. News reports that were footnoted and sourced would go a long way to enhance credibility. The federal and state governments collect about $40 billion a year in fuel taxes and transportation excise taxes.  There are fewer than 180,000 miles of federal highways in the United States. That is more than $220k/year per mile of roadway. If half of that is channeled (diverted?) back to the states for local highways and roadways, that still leaves $110k per mile of federal highway.  Reasonable estimates of annual maintenance of multilane highways are in the $25 to $30k per mile per year. That leaves more than $75k/year per mile of existing highway to pay for major repairs or replacement.  Where did the money go? As an economist, I hope you reconsider your desire for widening un-priced vehicle travel lanes. You're surely smart enough to know the bulk of literature refutes additional road capacity being a way to \"fix\" congestion. As you are also smart enough to know, additional road capacity induces greater SOV travel demand, increases per-capita VMT, and harms the environment \u2014 which you as economist will understand is an unpriced externality in the current road pricing framework.Yes! I'm all for real-time congestion-priced tolling everywhere. Roads are no longer public goods -- goods that you can't charge for. The Economic literature is full of papers offering impracticable suggestions and recommendations to policy makers.  \"Congestion-priced tolling\" has been implemented on interstate highway I-405 that serves the eastern half of greater metropolitan Seattle, in the State of Washington. Policy doesn't enforce congestion pricing in all of the lanes of I-405.  The state highway 520 is also tolled, but interstate highway I-90 is not.During the 1990s, Malaysia built a 4-lane tolled highway, and charged 20 Malaysian Ringgit per one-way trip from the International Airport to Kuala Lumpur.  A beautifully designed modern roadway, it was hardly used.  Instead, the alternative route from the International Airport into Kuala Lumpur was a heavily congested two-lane secondary highway that was the inefficient but untolled alternative that ran through densely built up urban areas. The cost in productive time lost, extra wages paid for time spent behind the wheel of lorries and taxis, and exhaust emissions were a consequence of government policy following the recommendations of the learned economists such as yourself.  Those negative externalities were the result of govenment policy, and are referred to as uncompensated governmental negative externalities, you no doubt know.  Blind application of economic theorists' theories is poor economic practice.  A properly performed benefit-cost analysis would have led to levying the toll on the older highway to reduce externalities, and left the new highway untolled to encourage diversion of traffic from the older route to the newer more economically efficient route.I could not agree more. Elections have consequences.  We have seen three elections where men who have not been fully vetted by the voter has succeeded in advancing to the Presidency.  These men, each in their own way, reflect the decline of voter faith and trust in the Government to do what is right.  The three of them are examples of what happens when the voter is engaged only to appear and cast a vote. Our Congress has failed to take up the fight for Freedom and has settled into counting their pension benefits paid for by you and me.  It is a messy time for Democracy.  Here's hoping.     How do you knowv that yellow plastic crosswalks can be dangerous to bicyclists in the rain?I ride bicycles in the rain. What is the incentive for representatives to care about the national budget? People have debt-like exposure to the government, so nobody wants governments to earn a profit. As for public needs, these are subject to the tragedy of the commons. The obvious solution here is to elect and incent representatives the same way board members are.It's even worse than you say. In Houston, they are blocking a highway project that is fully funded by state money already allocated.It appears Congress failed to write a Conference Report or Legislative History. That failure impairs or obscures the intent of the text of the law which, in turn, leaves the Biden Executive Branch to interpret the law pretty much as they see fit even if it contravenes the understanding of some of the Republican legislators who voted for it.Absurd. Why did Republicans not condition their votes on the writing of a Conference Report?https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/textThis comment has been removed by the author.Hi professor. I think you are wrong here. Current research on the subject is quite clear that more highways don't solve traffic problems. Your third lane one the I-5 will not be a solution.If it were true that we are no better off with more highways, then we are no worse off with less highways. Blow them up. There won't be any more traffic jams! The logical flaw: Even if traffic does not improve, more people go places. You may disparage their desire to do so, but it's important to them.

Instead, we saw disinflation and lower rates.The last year has been most welcome in the profession.\u201cThe risk-neutral mean is a better sufficient statistic for decisions\u201d is there a resource for a formal theory of sufficient statistics (including risk neutral means) in decision theory? Or are you using sufficient statistic loosely?Would be interesting to see this graph over a long period of rising interest rates.  This comment has been removed by the author.The 10 yr bond interest rate forecasts are available for analysis at:https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/tbondThe forecasts of the individual forecast professionals can be downloaded as an Excel file.  Mean and median statistics are also available in Excel format but, as summary statistics, these measures are less useful for purposes of analysis of forecasting accuracy, e.g., (expected minus actual)/actual.Forecasts are given by calendar quarter, enabling analysis of dynamic recalibration by individual forecaster.  The result is greater \"color\" in the data available to the data analyst.Torsten Slok's remark is hardly newsworthy. Forecasts are usually taken with a grain of salt.  It is not the mean, or the median, forecast that is useful, but the individual forecaster whose forecasting ability has demonstrated a consistent record of accuracy that is worth listening to. Find that individual or handful of individuals and pay attention to their estimates and expressed expectations.  The forecast survey data, not the statistical measures, is the critical information.This is a GREAT graph and great post.  I have grabbed this chart and shared it with friends on numerous occasions whenever we speak of inflation/rates and they go into...but the market isn't expecting...Broader question - what does a chart say about standard economic theories that depend on correct long-run expectations - should we still be making predictions based on P=E[mX] when \"E\" can be so screwed up for so long....?  Of course we can re-classify the mistake into \"the required rate of return\" but that seems so unappealing.  I think you are missing the point: long run expectations are already embedded in the price, but that price also embeds the cost of risk. You can't distill true expectations unless you have a perfect pricing model that can calculate the price of risk. As a shorthand, media and market participants refer to \"market expectations\" all the time. Knowingly or not, those are only pseudo expectations, accurate solely in a risk neutral world. Forecasters, intriguingly, seem to do the same thing.   Very interesting graph. When I was at Booth I did a paper on market sentiment/forecasters and correlation with the following periods of market movement. It was focused on the short term in commodity markets, but sentiment was generally correlated well with the previous period--recent rally, expect more of the same. The only forecasters with good records were forecasters in markets with positive serial correlation (long trends). This \"broken clock syndrome\" is interesting in the long run. And I've had my issues with the wind forecasts from NOAA as well. As a devout windsurfer, I grew frustrated with the forecasts always well above the measured windspeeds. I even did an unscientific study and contacted NOAA about the perils of crying wolf. No reply, but forecasts today are much more accurate than in the past. https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/media/Lehrstuehle/vwl/Adam/AdamMatveevNagel_JME.pdfThis JME paper shows quite convincingly that your explanation of risk-neutral or pessimistically-tilted expectations cannot be correct.

The right answer would seem to be, if you are not vaccinated, health insurance will adjust your premiums, as they do for smokers. Why must higher premiums for unvaccinated people be illegal?\u00a0Good points. I'm particularly I'm favor of vaccines and got all the required shoots. However, I don't really blame the average Joe if he doesn't want to take the vaccine because he doesn't trust the public health \"experts\". I mean, come on, besides all the points you talked about we still had: WHO being against masks, WHO saying that in cooperation with Chinese officers they found no evidence of human to human transmission (I even have print screens from their tweets), hundreds (HUNDREDS!) of epidemiologists signing a letter saying that BLM protests, in the most critical moment of the pandemic, were necessary and presented no significant risk of transmission.Those are all valid reasons for being angry with public health officials and thinking the CDC and the WHO need radical overhauls.  They are not reasons for refusing to take the vaccine.  The germ theory of disease is real. The disease is likely to be transmitted through the air - in which case masks and social distancing are prudent.  At this point there have been so many hundreds of millions of vaccine doses given that the safety and efficacy should be readily apparent whether or not you would trust the CDC or the WHO to tell you the time of day.  It makes no sense to say \"the CDC lied to me at the start when they downplayed the seriousness so they must be lying and exaggerating the seriousness now.\"  COVID vaccines: The COVID vaccines have killed tens of thousands of people and injured hundreds of thousands of people (https://openvaers.com/covid-data). More people have died from the COVID vaccines than from all of the other vaccines combined since 1997. And the vaccinated are not protected from getting or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and dying from COVID (see Belgium, Israel, UK, Iceland, Ireland, Singapore, Gibralter, etc., all highly vaccinated countries), so what is he point of the vaccines especially if they weaken our immune systems and make us more likely to have complications and die from COVID?https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/new-big-data-study-of-145-countries - New big data study of 145 countries show COVID vaccines makes things worse (cases and deaths). The study found that the COVID vaccines cause more COVID cases per million (+38% in US) and more deaths per million associated with COVID (+31% in US).https://popularrationalism.substack.com/p/in-the-united-states-vaccination - James Lyons-Weiler recently showed that the US state data shows that the more we vaccinate, the higher the # of COVID cases.https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19843315.covid-scotland-case-rates-lowest-unvaccinated-double-jabbed-elderly-drive-rise-hospital-admissions/ - COVID Scotland: Case rates lowest in unvaccinated as double-jabbed elderly drive rise in hospital admissions.According to Dr. Robert Malone: A statement out of Israel reports a nosocomial outbreak involving 16 healthcare workers, 23 exposed patients and two family members. The source was a fully vaccinated COVID-19 patient. The vaccination rate was 96.2% among all 248 exposed individuals (151 healthcare workers and 97 patients). Out of the 248 people, fourteen fully vaccinated patients became severely ill or died, and two unvaccinated patients developed mild diseaseMasks: The COVID-19 virus is tiny and most masks are ineffective at stopping the virus because the diameter of coronavirus \u2014 is 0.13 microns (a micron is 1,000 times smaller than a millimeter). The best N95 standard mask only filters down to 0.3 microns, therefore the masks are ineffective in stopping transmission of COVID. Wearing a mask is like putting up a chain link fence to stop mosquitos. I think most people know that masks are useless for stopping COVID and masks are harmful for socializing, learning, breathing, peer interaction, and masks are devastating for autistic and deaf children. Masks can also cause bacterial and fungal infections, etc. Even the CDC and former FDA director Scott Gottlieb said masks do not stop coronaviruses.And, according to a study by Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University (https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2031), young children showed a 22-point drop in IQ (IQ dropped from 100 to 78 - therefore children went from average intelligence (100 IQ) to retarded (78 IQ). The 22-point drop in IQ in young children is because the masks, lockdowns, and social distancing, etc., cause a lack of stimulation from peers, parents, grandparents, etc.Solution: There are over 213 million people in Nigeria but less than 3,200 COVID deaths. Could the Nigerians have a low death rate (.0001) from COVID because they take hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) daily to prevent malaria? Could therapeutics/medications (combination of ivermectin, Fluvoxamine, and Methylprednisolone along with HCQ/Quercetin, zinc, vitamin D3 and C, as well as monoclonal antibodies) be the answer to treating/curing COVID?No one needs to die from COVID if we use medications and therapeutics like the ones listed above for prevention and early treatment, and if we encourage people to keep their weight in check, exercise, and eat and sleep well.Aye, Aye!I am unhappy with the quality of most public health guidance and believe they should have been better.  On the other hand there seem to be legions of bad faith actors perfectly happy to seize on anything they can to get their own piece of the public attention.  Some of those bad faith actors are in politics and some are in the media and some are trying to establish followings on social media.  To say that immunity acquired by having had Covid gives better protection than getting the vaccine is meaningless, or worse, if you are 1,000 times more likely to die from having Covid than from getting the vaccine. When you have been deluded it's really hard to accept reality. Good luck with that.COVID has a 99% survival rate for those under age 70, and not recognizing natural immunity and early treatment has let to disastrous outcomes and deaths.Drs Ioannidis & Axfors at Stanford - survival rate for COVID Age         Infection Survival Rate0-19        99.9973%20-29     99.986%30-39     99.969%40-49     99.918%50-59     99.73%60-69     99.41%70+         97.6% (non-inst.)70+         94.5% (all)https://brownstone.org/articles/natural-immunity-and-covid-19-twenty-nine-scientific-studies-to-share-with-employers-health-officials-and-politicians/ - 30 peer reviewed scientific studies showing the protection and longevity of natural immunityIf, per Fauci, everyone will get omicron/COVID, regardless of vaccination status, masks, social distancing, etc., then we can abolish all COVID restrictions and stop the vaccine mandates?89% of Covid-19 deaths in the UK are among the fully vaccinated, which proves this is a \u2018pandemic of the fully vaccinated\u2019 and suggests the vaccinated are more likely to die. The fully vaxed are the ones filling up hospitals in the US and in other countries.The COVID vaccines do not prevent the vaccinated from getting and/or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and/or dying from COVID? Why mandate ineffective vaccines when there are highly effective therapeutics/medications (Ivermectin, nitazoxanide, proxalutamide, Fluvoxamine, azithromycin, Methylprednisolone, spironolactone, dutasteride, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Quercetin/HCQ, and zinc) as well as Regeneron\u2019s monoclonal antibody therapy to treat COVID and prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and/or death.\"Because the CDC thinks we're morons and can't understand that, so it must suppress evidence of natural immunity to scare people into vaccination.\"The CDC can protect itself by pointing to numbers of vaccinations. Natural immunity does nothing for the CDC. It's all quite rational.What bothers me personally is only their brazenness. Excellent blogging. The war on Covid-19 has become the public health sector's Vietnamistan.The issue aren't false beliefs like anti vax that go against 'expert' or 'elite' opinion. The FAR more worrisome issue are the patently false beliefs of the elite and 'experts' themselves, on issues such as sexual identity, race, criminology, psychometrics, etc. These drive actual policy impacting almost every aspect of governance from education, immigration, welfare, taxation, police enforcement, sentencing, etc. And they repeatedly get it wrong and double down on insanity. I'll gladly take some populistic dumb takes over that. There is a good point here. Every lie undermines every truth. When public health authorities ration vaccines to \"redress historic inequities,\" as they did in California, then people use that information when deciding whether their current advice has scientific merit. And people don't necessarily appreciate the fine lines between bureaucracies as we do. Every bit of fantastical spin by Washington politicians and bureaucrats undermines trust in the occasional quite reasonable pronouncement by other Washington politicians or bureaucrats. After the boy cried wolf too many times, they also ignore the girl who cries wolf when the real wolf appears. I agree.  Whether they like it or not, all \"experts\" are part of a meta-guild of \"experts\".  Their credibility is held jointly.  If they had a code of ethics, one of the rules would be \"Nothing false\".  Anyone in any field who undermines trust does so across the board.  It's not fair or logical; it's the way people respond.\"As it becomes clear that vaccines do not stop transmission\" Could you please qualify this statement to make clear that vaccines do not *fully* stop transmission, but they reduce transmission, both through preventing many infections altogether and by reducing viral load among those who do get infected despite vaccination.Oh like the US Naval vessel that was quarantined last week? Everyone on board was fully vaccinated but 236 plus crew members came down with the Wuhan.This comment has been removed by the author.\"I tried to get a booster in September and ran in to forbidden. Before it became mandatory.\"I could tell the same story, except that my brother is an experienced pulmonary physician. He coached me on the magic words to use to get around the bureaucratic barrier.Not to put too fine a point on it, but, I lied and got my booster. I don't feel bad about it.In the referenced study cited at the WSJ, do the authors control for hospitalization of previously infected people? Ex-ante, I am not surprised that previously infected people have lower chances of being hospitalized because they have proved to have good immunity to survive the first time they were exposed to the virus. Also, even if they control for previously hospitalizations, my assumption is that these people would be more careful after coming out of the hospital, so even if they get re-infected perhaps the viral load is low because they have been more careful. Am I missing something? I agree that vaccination remains the safest public health strategy. We are ok there. We may also agree that, current lies or not, vaccination remains the most important or a key part of the strategy, so I am ok to accept the noise (lies, mishaps, miscommunication, etc). While data on reinfection rates and more transparency (now, in the past and future) should be expected, the focus on vaccination may be more effective than a plethora of measures that may muddy the waters, especially for the average folk \"doing their research\". So, while the overall approach of government agencies should feature more transparency regarding data, the public policy strategy should focus on the most effective tools, or tool in this case. \"Get vaccinated and wear a mask when indoors\" is not much of an ask frankly, and it is a clear line. Whether \"the CDC\" thinks we're morons is a bit besides the point frankly. Most of us have cognitive/information processing limitations (kids' homework, bills to pay, other health issues, etc) and a simple line that is adjusted in line with the preponderance of evidence is called for; do the vaccines remain the best tool? Yes. Any reason not to wear better masks indoor? No. Recalibrate type of mask in public communication. Boosters needed? Add that \"Get vaxxed, get boosted\". Rinse and repeat. Mistakes will be made. Has the focus on vaccines waned? No. Good then. Again, regardless of whether \"the CDC\" thinks we are morons. We should continue to review the experience, including in 2020 to learn and incorporate lessons going forward. Same with natural immunity. But only add to broader public policy strategy if there is a clear message with positive payoffs. The fact that 15 thousand people are expected to die over the next week when vaccines are widely available, indicates that there are morons out there. I wager that they are not \"doing their own research\" on the cost and benefits of natural immunity - instead they watch a certain set of TV channels and worship a few personalities (there are data on that, don't take my word for it). And nothing wrong with that, this is a free country. I hope the unvaccinated stay safe, don't get sick, and wish they would join smokers in my health insurance plans. But none of the above change the fact that public policy is largely appropriate as it continues to focus on the the best available tool to reduce hosp/mortality: vaccines. If there is confusion about masks and boosters, no need to add new guidance or recommendations focused on natural immunity. More, not less, of a KISS approach is needed here. Parsimony and common sense should not be underrated. Cheers.     Our hospitals would not have to treat anyone with COVID, whether vaxxed or not, if the medical community would emphasize early treatment with therapeutics/medications (Ivermectin, nitazoxanide, proxalutamide, Fluvoxamine, azithromycin, Methylprednisolone, spironolactone, dutasteride, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Quercetin/HCQ, and zinc) as well as Regeneron\u2019s monoclonal antibody therapy to treat COVID and prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and/or death.Why have we lost our collective minds and constitutional rights over a virus that has a 99% plus survival rate for those under age 70? Why would anyone require proof of vaccination when the vaccines do not prevent the vaccinated from getting and/or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and/or dying from COVID? https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/new-big-data-study-of-145-countries - New big data study of 145 countries show COVID vaccines makes things worse (cases and deaths). The study found that the COVID vaccines cause more COVID cases per million (+38% in US) and more deaths per million associated with COVID (+31% in US).https://twitter.com/BLNewsMedia/status/1434622637653823494 - fully vaccinated Oscar De La Hoya's comeback fight was delayed by a COVID hospitalization, meanwhile podcaster Joe Rogan, maligned for being unvaccinated, recovers in 3 days with treatments, like Ivermectin, vitamin D3, C, zinc, and monoclonal antibodies.Why mandate ineffective vaccines when there are highly effective therapeutics/medications (Ivermectin, nitazoxanide, proxalutamide, Fluvoxamine, azithromycin, Methylprednisolone, spironolactone, dutasteride, vitamin D3, vitamin C, Quercetin/HCQ, and zinc) as well as Regeneron\u2019s monoclonal antibody therapy to treat COVID and prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and/or death.The fundamental flaw in policy is that you should lie to get people to behave in the right way.When Fauci tells kids he vaccinated Santa, this is no exception to how many leaders at the CDC and NIH operate: Lie to get the behavior you want. This approach is only warranted when: 1. You actually know what's best 2. The population could never comprehend the truth. Neither is true here.This highlights why there needs to be a division between topic-expertise can policy formation. The best doctors will fail to formulate optimal policy when they don't get economics or statistics, or have incentive to balance the various needs of the population. I agree that the CDC should be more open with its data and that many public experts have done a terrible job. However, I doubt this is responsible for much of the vaccine hesitancy we are seeing. The posts I see my family post on facebook about the vaccine are about autism or the naive belief that because vaccines don't prevent infection they don't work at all. These people wouldn't take the vaccine even if the CDC had been more transparent. I'd also argue that refusing to treat the unvaccinated is inhumane if there aren't enough resources to go around. If there's one hospital bed and two people -- one who reduced the risk of Covid and the other who chose not to -- the former should be the one to get it in my view. I'd agree that unvax premiums should be legal though :)It is the vaxxed who are ending up in the hospitals sick and dying from COVIDhttps://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/new-big-data-study-of-145-countries - New big data study of 145 countries show COVID vaccines makes things worse (cases and deaths). The study found that the COVID vaccines cause more COVID cases per million (+38% in US) and more deaths per million associated with COVID (+31% in US).There are over 213 million people in Nigeria but less than 3,200 COVID deaths. Could the Nigerians have a low death rate (.0001) from COVID because they take hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) daily to prevent malaria? Could therapeutics/medications (combination of ivermectin, Fluvoxamine, and Methylprednisolone along with HCQ/Quercetin, zinc, vitamin D3 and C, as well as monoclonal antibodies) be the answer to treating/curing COVID?No one needs to die from COVID if we use medications and therapeutics like the ones listed above for prevention and early treatment, and if we encourage people to keep their weight in check, exercise, eat and sleep well.Why have we lost our collective minds and constitutional rights over a virus that has a 99% plus survival rate for those under age 70? Why would anyone require proof of vaccination when the vaccines do not prevent the vaccinated from getting and/or spreading COVID or from getting seriously ill and/or dying from COVID?

The Proximal Origins paper apepars to have been written under pressure from Fauci and Collins. The 11 January letter from the Oversight Committee has details. We\u2019ll start trusting the experts when they start being trustworthy. I won\u2019t be holding my breath: apparently Fauci was on the radio just this week saying a lab leak is very unlikely. It\u2019s really just insane behaviour \u2014 they seem to be actively doing their best to destroy trust in science.https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Letter-Re.-Feb-1-Emails-011122.pdfThis comment has been removed by the author.It is my understanding that vaccines reduce your odds of infection and also reduce the amount of time that you are infectious. Also, they do both of these reductions better if you get 2 doses rather than 1 one. Also, better if you get 3 doses rather than 2.The public discourse is too often in boolean statements when probabilities statements would be more accurate. This certainly undermines the trust of the public.Adjustment of health insurance premiums is the sensible response in the US, but obviously isn't possible in countries with a public health system, i.e., most of them. In principle, the same thing could be achieved via a surcharge or tax, but this would be administratively cumbersome and of doubtful effectiveness. In such circumstances, some kind of quantity rationing in health may be the only feasible response. Far from 'inhuman', that would seem to be a far kinder, and more directly consequential, policy than depriving people  of their careers, social circles, and ability to access all kinds of services.   Inflation!Why isn't anyone listening?  Why do so many Americans believe crazy things? Maybe not \"crazy,\" but beliefs that wildly get wrong factual costs and benefits, such as those of vaccines? It does not help that they have been lied to, over and over again. Why should they believe anything now? Our elites, and in particular our public health bureaucrats, though invoking the holy name of \"science,\" have been trying to massage public psychology via deliberate obfuscation for a few years now. There is little science of managing public psychology, and if there is, epidemiologists don't have it. There is some good ancient wisdom, as codified in the story of the boy who cried wolf.  We do know that when lies are exposed, when elites are shown to be disparaging and trying to manipulate average people, trust erodes.Anxieties regarding the \"management\" of the public has been around a good long time. Plato's  The Republic  is a lamentation about the end of idealism. His position that the philosophers (the elite) should run the city-state was rooted in a severe mistrust of the public. Machiavelli \"modernized\" his position and it became about how to manipulate the public as so to prevent instability/chaos.Point is, there has been a long history of distrust of the public, for it's the belief that they cannot manage their affairs properly, and thus, it needs to be chosen for them. Remember that \"The Prince\" was rewritten by Hobbes in \"The Leviathan,\" and Locke would later rewrite it for his cultural epoch during the Rationalist Enlightenment, which heavily influenced the Founding Fathers. Even Jefferson had a severe mistrust of the public.This is nothing new, but it wrestles with the problem that in the end, people just don't like being told what to do. Freedom only exists in a confined, pre-determined structure. Michel Foucault's \"Madness and Civilization\" isn't really about mental health: it's about how society has a built in immune system to remove and isolate those that do not fit into recognizable society or refuse to adhere to \"established norms.\"I suppose this goes to the idea of \"useful myths.\" The problem arises when the veil is pierced and there's a swamp of contradictory data and opinions lurking beneath. I am fully-vaccinated and boostered based on my personal situation and risk assessment. I consider the broad resistance to all vaccines a tragedy but it should be obvious that shame, insults and coercion build resentment and make the problem of vaccine resistance worse. Sure, if sweet reason would work that is preferable.  If appeals to the common good would work, that would be preferable.  In my case, I have a couple of young adult children who were vaccine hesitant until the British Columbia government said: \"if you want to go to a bar or restaurant then you need to vaccinated\"; at which point they got vaccinated.  But the aggressive anti-vaxxers who seize on any quibble or nuance and treat it as a complete rebuttal are not susceptible to reason so we are left with: \"get vaccinated or stay away from us\".  We are at a point where soon we will start lifting more restrictions but that is just because the number of unvaccinated has declined to the point where the hospitals and morgues will be able to handle the extra cases.  Common good \u2014- interesting. Whose common good?  You NEVER sacrifice personal liberty and freedom for the collective good \u2014- that is the mantra of communism. I will not take this vaccine and not because I\u2019m an anti-vaxxer. By the designers\u2019 own admission, it\u2019s not a vaccine. Vaccines PREVENT acquisition of said disease. This SHOT guarantees nothing, except a less severe case of a disease with over a 99% survival rate. Also, numerous scientific reports show that 4 times as many spores were present in vaccinated people. Here is the foundational problem of lying and misleading humans: in order to maintain your illusion you have to censor all opposition or vilify any expert whose data contradicts your lie  Another problem with dishonesty is that once your illusion in shown to be fiction you have two options: come clean or continue the narrative. World leaders, both medical and political,  opted for the latter. Problem: the veil has been lifted. Too many reports, from over 149 countries including the US, show the VACCINATED ARE DYING AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE UNVACCINATED. Healthy young men dying of Myocarditis, women delivering stillborn children or miscarrying, extremely fit professional athletes dying of cardiac arrests \u2014/ all after vaccination. These are not isolated nor unrelated. If we are saying science is driving the vaccine, then why aren\u2019t these side effects from a \u201csafe\u201d vaccine being widely reported and investigated?  None of the MSM has reported on this \u2014- their job is to continue the narrative and they have the majority of the population as their viewing audience. All this aside, I find your rationale both disconcerting and cruel at best, and manipulative and hateful at its worse. If you research behaviors associated with Hitler\u2019s brown shirts, you will find you share much of the bravado that made them a lethal medicine to Nazi opponents, and ultimately to the great nation of Germany.  Their goal was also the COMMON GOOD of German people. Their tactics: first, propaganda. Next, coercion. Then, intimidation. Then, violence.  Then, use of fellow Germans to isolate and betray their fellow man, and finally, death to any opposition. Forcing compliance for Common Good, however pure your paint your motives, eventually eradicates freedom and liberty for your opposition, and ultimately\u2014- you. We ARE morons.Unfortunately, the WSJ article you cite is behind a paywall, but that's OK as I stopped reading their OpEds long ago.I suspect the CDC research they refer to is dated 1/19/22 and be reached at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm.Several thoughts struck me as I read the summary of findings on this study: 1) we knew nothing about Covid 19 and how to treat it when it first appeared. 2) our understanding of Covid 19, how it affects people and how to treat it, has constantly evolved since, especially as new variants have emerged, and 3) numerous mistakes by politicians and scientific communities along the way have only made things worse. Two years into the pandemic, its easy to claim that masks and lockdowns haven't made any difference, but that's a position impossible to defend as we simply don't know what the outcome would have been had we not taken these measures.The CDC article cited above does make clear that so-called \"natural\" immunity may, in fact, be stronger than that conferred through vaccination. However, and this cannot be underscored enough, natural immunity can only obtained through actually contracting the virus, which may lead to serious illness, hospitalization or death. Being vaccinated on the other hand, reduces the likelihood of being infected in the first place and if infected, can reduce the severity and mortality of being infected.The WSJ's article may suggest that natural immunity is better than that conveyed through vaccination, but the CDC's conclusion remains the same: \"Initial infection among unvaccinated persons increases risk for serious illness, hospitalization, long-term sequelae, and death.....Thus, vaccination remains the safest and primary strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections, associated complications, and onward transmission.\"\"However, and this cannot be underscored enough, natural immunity can only obtained through actually contracting the virus, which may lead to serious illness, hospitalization or death.\"Oh look - its our old friend selection bias.  More specifically, survivorship bias. A reoccurring issue in the mutual fund performance literature. Thierry are six questions I have asked since the vaccine \u201cpush\u201d began:1) Vaccine development and approval is a 7-10 year project \u2014- based on all previous vaccines. How did this vaccine go from inception to injection in under a year??2) THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY\u2014 SCIENCE \u2014- has always said natural immunity is the best. Yet before they,d even isolated the COVID 19 germ or developed a VALID, ACCURATE test, these \u201cexperts\u201d were saying a vaccine was better than natural immunity. When did our immune systems stop doing their designated job of producing antibodies to disease?  3) I\u2019ve never had vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough because many \u201cboomers\u201d had these diseases. only children that hadn\u2019t had the disease received the vaccination and then 99.9% of them never got the disease and didn\u2019t need a \u201cbooster\u201d to maintain the immunity the vaccine provided. The COVID vaccine doesn\u2019t prevent the disease. How can it be called a vaccine if it doesn\u2019t prevent the disease it\u2019s targeting?4) EVERY SARS VACCINE trial ended at ferret trials (COVID is. SARS variant.). A ferret\u2019s immune system is most similar to a human\u2019s. There were two side effects as each vaccine went through these trials: death and immune system response disorder, which usually resulted in death from another infection due to a compromised immune system. Why were ferret trials skipped  and this vaccine rushed to humans?5) Once 10 deaths are tied to a vaccine it is pulled. Over 250 professional athletes have DIED from cardiovascular episodes shortly after receiving their vaccine. The information is out there. We\u2019ve lost over 100 boys under age 17 with myocarditis\u2014- 100 young men \u2014- dead \u2014- who are not even high risk. Hundreds of women have miscarried or their children were stillborn. All of them vaccinated. Why are these vaccines still being administered?  6) Whole populations, in this case, the world, have never been expected to be guinea pigs for experimental products, ie vaccines. Why is the world\u2019s population being used as \u201cferrets\u201d to test this experimental vaccine?  And a final question, why did the Emergency Covid Act excuse Big Pharma from any financial responsibility due to injury or death from their products???Food for thought:  these three Pharmaceutical Giants are expected to net trillions of dollars from their \u201cvaccines\u201d. Which begs one more question: Why would any government allow experimentation on their citizens, remove all liability from producer of said product, unless there was something for them?I\u2019ve always believed you follow the money. If you think logically about the last two years and the lies and misinformation, a conclusion is very easy to draw. YOU CANT CLAIM SCIENCE IS YOUR IMPETUS FOR DECISIONS WHEN YOU DISPARAGE SCIENCE THAT PROVES YOUR HYPOTHESIS WAS WRONG AT ITS FOUNDATION AND CONTINUE TO MISINFORM THE PUBLIC WITHOUT EXPECTATION OF SOMETHING AT THE BACKSIDE OF THE CIRCUS OF FEAR YOU SET INTO MOTION. \"How did this vaccine go from inception to injection in under a year??\"For the same reason that the United States was able to go from virtually nothing to building 60,000 aircraft per year and large numbers of aircraft carriers after WWII started.  The United States (and the world generally) has enormous intellectual, financial and industrial resources available to apply to an urgent problem. Brilliant! \"You NEVER sacrifice personal liberty and freedom for the collective good\" If Australians understood this point, life here would be a whole lot more bearable.niceComments are welcome.

Here's an interesting extension to your analysis (well, interesting from my perspective): how should long-term investors care about their exposures to market neutral investment strategies (like value, momentum, etc.)? It's less obvious how the returns to these strategies break down into their \"cash flow\" and \"discount rate\" components. I think a Campbell & Vuolteenaho (2004) style decomposition would be helpful in understanding the recent moves in these strategies, and help long-term investors think about their exposures to these strategies (either implicitly or explicitly). I should have said \"it's less obvious how _recent returns_ to these strategies break down into their...\". Anyway, you get the idea. Long term investors should care about discount rates. Even in the, very theoretical, case that future cash-flows remain the same they would be \"paying\" a diferent price for exercicing the \"flexibility\" of moving these cash-flows around that markets of liquid assets provide.Let's imaging that I am a long term investor that has perfectly matched my future liabilities with the future dividend payments from my portfolio. Then unexpected liabilites come due (afterall live is what really happens while you are making wrong forecasts). I prefer to face those unexpected liabilities in the \"December discount rate enviroment\" rather than in the \"last Monday discount rate enviroment\", to be perfectly honest.Brilliant post. Thanks for sharing. Also,How should long term investors structure their liabilities relative to their assets?Note: We can't all be bankers, borrowing short to invest long.\"Prices being somewhat sticky, higher nominal interest rates will mean a higher real interest rate...\"Hmmm, if prices were so \"sticky\" then they should be sticky in both directions - up and down.  So why did supposedly \"sticky\" prices rise to begin with?Frank, my thoughts on why \"sticky\" prices rose. Large scale asset purchases by the FED. (9 trillion now on its balance sheet). Real interest rates were zero or negative. How does this affect CAPM or 3 factor models? Low nominal rates pushed investors searching for yield into risky assets. With a rise in rates, markets decline. As an exercise, play with interest rates in a Dividend Discount Model (DDM). It gives  an insight to this discussion.   It is not clear that the Fed will raise interest rates so quickly. The time to be frugal is before borrowing before you spend it all on poker chips. Once the game is lost, and the debt is owed, frugality eats into utility much more severely. Mechanically, because of declining marginal utility to wealth, being frugal before borrowing is less painful than afterwards, unless you invested wisely rather than consuming. The US has found that it's \"investment\" in bailouts did not earn much in terms of long-run productivity. What should it do now? Our borrowing gambler has two choices: eat into wealth in a way that was more painful than before he borrowed, or defaulting. If the political will to be frugal or investing prowess was not present before borrowing, it is unlikely to be there afterwards.Thus, our gambler will almost certainly end up defaulting. The most painless way to default is via inflation, and that is most likely how this will go down. My guess is that the US tried to avoid inflation in 1929-1930 to avoid the mistakes of Germany a few years prior. What the US didn't realize is that massive defaults on debt generates more political instability than inflation. My vote would be the same here: Default on the debt via inflation. In the long run, the only way to avoid inflation is by avoiding a budget deficit. As long as you have a deficit, it's just a matter of when. Obviously, the advice to the US would be to run the Federal government profitably, but that is politically impossible given the incentives of voters and representatives.Clueless.As the sage said: \"in the short run, the market is a voting machine, in the long run, the market is a weighing machine.\" (attributed to Benjamin Graham)Unless you are a \"professional voter\" best to stick to the weighing machine strategies.  Today's markets were fascinating from an intellectual standpoint. They went down at the start of the trading day, and continued in read only to recover and end up in green by the end of the day. Amazing. To me, this is a discount rate mechanism, which is what John (I believe) is suggesting in his post. But the come back we have seen at the end of the trading day seems to me more related to important players trying to cover their losses. Now, there are many news going on that are difficult to reconcile and that could potentially lead to cashflow story behind markets today (e.g., Ukraine-Russia war?). This comment has been removed by the author.I remember Larry Summers making a related point: that the increase in wealth in recent years has been accompanied by declining expected returns, leaving those with such wealth in pretty much the same place as they were before.Nice post. Some thoughts. Long term buy and hold tends to outperform actively managed portfolios. As an aside, my alpha as a hedge fund trader and manager was zero. Where on the long term horizon is the investor? If they are are 25, they have 40 years to build wealth with portfolios invested 100% in market ETF's. At age 65, they will have likely moved their holdings to about 60% cash. If some investors are truly rational, they will have bought in a declining market with a strategy such as, for every 5% market decline, they buy with 1% of their cash position.    A 65 year old 60% in cash is seriously underestimating the risk that he might live to 90.People are over reacting to volatility. Since 1950 the S&P 500 has spent ~50% of the time down more than 5% from the previous all time high and has averaged being down ~10% from the previous all time high.  Anyone who is going to panic at a 10% drop has stumbled into the wrong bar.  On a 10-12 years horizon, what the Fed does or doesn't do will have little influence on the stock market performance. Returns have been front loaded and the probability of positive real total return into 2032 are very low.

So important, in fact, that I wrote a distilled version of the original keynote speech for RIAs (no, few read long papers or listen to long presentations): https://alphaarchitect.com/2021/07/08/leading-emh-economist-john-cochrane-advocates-for-advisor-fees/Sadly, the dynamics of the industry favor those with asset gathering skills rather than the ability to help smooth consumption. Most individual investors want to pay alms to their false prophets and in return be told how safe they are before they doze off to sleep. Those few willing to read and capable to understand John's blasphemy don't bother hiring advisors. Especially now that the Dimensional Fund Advisors' barn gates are open. Still, I'm glad John is trying and happy to lend a hand.  I should note, John certainly doesn't imply \"fees are justified\" and I admit as much (I had hoped) by calling my title click bait in the opening sentence. Very few advisors follow his advice and thus justify their fees.For the average individual, the following are likely to be the largest purchases over a lifetime:1.  Primary residence2.  Transporatation (personal vehicles)3.  Energy4.  Higher education5.  Medical careDo any of these fall into the \"long term asset portfolio\" for investors?If you don't confine your assets to \"financial assets\" that have some promise to pay cash flows (and I think John does), you end of investing in NFTs and Crypto (or maybe Jackson Pollock paintings...not saying you can't eventually sell anything higher in the future). Plus, these non-financial assets on your list cover a liability (a place to live, need to get somewhere, live comfortably, converse intelligently, and avoid sickness) so can live outside of your portfolio. Not that you were really serious, but as John points out, all these assets are dwarfed by your own human capital (i.e., your ability to make your own cash flow). That asset is what needs the most tending to and arguably while value stocks that do poorly in a recession offer a risk premium. John,\"The paper grows out of the summary I used to give for MBA and PhD students.\"Do you tell those students they are wasting their (or their parents) money pursuing a higher education (MBA or PhD degree) and should instead be plowing that money into the stock / bond markets?\"Buy stocks for the dividends\".  What? Stock returns come from value appreciation, not dividends.  If you own a $100 share of stock, and then there's a $5 dividend, then you own a $95 share of stock and $5 cash.This is a common and important fallacy. Short-run stock returns do come from value appreciation (or depreciation!) But the title is \"for the long-run investor.\" Value appreciation can only go so far. The price/earnings, or price/dividend ratio can only grow so far. Eventually, when price/earnings or price/dividend ratios run out of steam, the long-run return is completely dominated by the growth in dividends (including all cash payouts to investors.) Thanks for the response, but I disagree. I feel like you're neglecting share buybacks.  Also, there's nothing stopping a company growing for hundreds of years, making profits and reinvesting them (or share buybacks if there are not growth opportunities).And again, dividends only come from value appreciation.  A company can't give a $5 dividend unless they actually appreciated in value the $5 first.  Dividends are merely a mechanism for transferring cash from the company to shareholders and dividends are not the only such mechanism.Jacob, you are correct there is nothing stopping a company growing for hundreds of years and reinvesting all its profits and/or buying its shares back. And yes, buybacks are equivalent to dividends in terms of transferring cash to shareholders (and arguably, much more tax efficient). But John's point is that even then, after hundreds of years, there is a limit to growth and a finite number of shares to buy back. Perhap in this future world, this fantasy company has swallowed up all other companies and all but one of its shareholders. Even then, that single remaining shareholder would demand some reward for sticking around. 1) If a company grows at the same rate (or less) as the economy/whatever, then the company has not \"swallowed up all other companies\" even after arbitrary time has passed.2) There are a finite and unbounded number of shares that can exist.  Imagine that every time the share price reaches $100, there is a 2-for-1 split.  Running out of shares for share buybacks is not an issue.Perhaps you should first imagine a simpler scenario where a company provides long-term value without ever paying a dividend AND NO GROWTH.  Imagine a company that every year makes exactly $50K in profit and spends that $50K on share buybacks.  Every time the share price reaches $100, there's a 2-for-1 split.  This goes on for as long as you wish.  There you go; a very modest company providing long term value for investors without a single dividend and no growth.You can add growth to the picture.  Every year the economy grows as 2% and the company's profits grow at 1% (this goes on for quite some time until we saturate the observable universe with the most economically efficient arrangement of matter and energy).  The company reinvests some of its profits and spends the rest on share buybacks.  Shares are splits as needed.  Over time the company is a smaller proportion of the overall economy despite growing every year.sory, correction to my first reply. I did say a \"finite number of shares...\" at first. That was wrong. I should have said \"finite number of shareholders...\"Why would number of shareholders dwindle over time?  That is not necessarily so.Even if there is only one remaining shareholder, that is no obstacle to share buybacks allowing the company to deliver cash flows to that single shareholder.Your objections are very puzzling to me.I think we both agree that everything else being equal, over any discrete time period, shareholders  are indifferent if the company pays dividends, buys back stock, reinvests in more factories or stock piles cash. It's pure Modigliani-Miller. But....1) Who do you expect to eventually buy the company that is growing (or not) to become a trivial part of the economy with no promise of a payout? Not that the \"great fool theory\" isn't alive and well in NFT and  Crypto space, but stops any  interesting discussion of finance.2) I said shareholders, not shares. Eventually, the sold remaining shareholder needs to find a \"rational\" (see note 1) counterparty whether they own 1 share or a million. I do agree it helps to create real but simplified worlds (aka models) to help explain our much messier reality. In fact, I  did so a few years ago in this article on buybacks: https://alphaarchitect.com/2018/08/30/buybacks-why-they-dont-matter-why-they-do-and-why-you-should-care-yet-still-relax/No promise of a payout? There are share buybacks.  The company is willing to offer cash for your shares.  No fool of any type is needed to turn your shares into cash flows.Jon Seed, I don't know you very well, but you seem to have a very strange quirk of treating share buybacks very differently than dividends.  Why is it that you gave dividends a free pass to all your concerns but are so skeptical of share buybacks?  Dividends and share buybacks are both mechanisms for a company to deliver cash to shareholders (aka give a \"payout\" as you are concerned about).I will agree, a firm can always buy everyone out and take the company private. A buyout is a \"payout\" my last remaining shareholder will rationally accept. Jon, I didn't say anything about buying everyone out (completely) and going private.  I talked about normal share buybacks where <100% of outstanding shares are bought by the company, specifically about the situation of one shareholder that you seem concerned about.  Share buybacks can go on for arbitrarily long amounts of time without completely buying everyone out and going private.I know. I just think we exhausted this conversation. For the record, though, I agree in the equivalence of buyback and dividends (I linked to my article earlier) and I'm sure John is as well. I also agree then can go on for \"arbitrarily long amounts of time\". I disagree that buybacks can go on forever. I tried to use the natural end point (one last remaining shareholder) to illustrate why a firm has to eventually make a \"payout\", but obviously I failed. We can try one last time: why do you think that the situation of one shareholder and share buybacks can't go on forever?  A sole shareholder can receive cash flows from the company via share buybacks forever (much like dividends).It seems your mom has a hunch about non ergodicity. Comments are welcome.

But there are signs that something has gone wrong. Principal investigators report spending 44% of their time doing grant-related paperwork and maintenance (as opposed to active research). The average age of a principal investigator working at the National Institutes of Health rose from 39 years old in 1980 to 51 years old in 2008. And our scientific discoveries today appear to be less fundamental than previous advances as we continue to spend more resources. The researcher Pierre Azoulay has argued that we need to \u201cturn the scientific method on ourselves\u201d, and this is the direction we want to push public policy.\u00a0Absolutely! Economists tend to jump to \"Science is a public good, subsidize it,\" but the mechanisms of that subsidy matter. It is possible to pay people to waste time, and for a bureaucracy to become self-rewarding and sclerotic. The science bureaucracy is going woke fast. (The latest: Chemistry journals)\u00a0At least study what works. Study science funding as we study all bureaucracy and regulation, as a case of public choice theory. Tyler Cowen's fast grants initiative is eye opening as to how much low hanging fruit seems out there. \u00a0Immigration \u2013 How can we attract and retain superstar talent from around the globe?For decades, the U.S.\u2019s asymmetric advantage has been that many of the most ambitious individuals from all around the world desperately want to live and work here...... high-skilled immigration remains a vitally important, yet neglected policy topic. In particular, reforms that leverage the wide scope of executive action are underrated. ... Through both legislation and executive action, the U.S. urgently needs to start taking a proactive approach to recruiting global talent.\u00a0While I absolutely agree on the policy, two warnings. First, counting on \"executive action\" is dangerous. Parties change every 4 years and the next executive can undo it. Second, knowledge is non-rival. From the point of view of progress, all innovation can happen in China or Europe, and the US can become the following nation. All that matters for growth is that innovation happen somewhere. I'd rather it happen here, and we have for the moment the best place in the world to do it. But this is still about raising the US relative to the rest of the world.\u00a0That immigrants are key to innovation -- even Chinese doctoral students at US universitities, that it is fashionable to disparage, is also not particularly news. But high skill immigration does need a broader political constituency.\u00a0 \u2013 How can we prevent future pandemics and accelerate progress in the life sciences?...the pandemic exposed how weak and ineffectual our public health systems are at controlling highly contagious airborne respiratory diseases. On the other hand, the urgency of the moment \u2014 combined with decades of previous investment \u2014 enabled us to deliver mRNA vaccines in less than nine months.\u00a0... it\u2019s entirely possible, if not probable, that future pandemics will be even more infectious and deadly than COVID. In the news today, antibiotic resistant bacteria are on the rise. It might not even be viruses. And I don't know why our enemies are putting so much money into nuclear weapons, when designed viruses could cripple us so cheaply. \u00a0We need to advance metagenomic sequencing capabilities that can quickly detect new viruses. We need to invest in wastewater surveillance systems so we can scale those virus detection capacities across the US. We need to build mRNA vaccine manufacturing capacity so we can rapidly respond when new viruses attack. We need to leverage these systems to fight existing diseases like malaria, HIV, and influenza, which collectively kill millions of people a year. The pandemic has revealed that the life sciences contain much more low-hanging fruit \u2014 if we can only implement the right public policies.Maybe. But we first need to start asking the questions. And then not let it languish, as all the answers to these questions did after the last SARS/ /There is lots to add. I would add\u00a0But I'm here to cheer asking the question, not necessarily the answers that come up in such a preliminary document.\u00a0Perhaps some of this is reflected in\u00a0Policy as roadblock or catalyst...Regulation can unintentionally block new innovations from reaching the market and rob society of their benefits. Why do we give regulatory special treatment to oil and gas drilling on public land over geothermal drilling? Why hasn\u2019t a single new nuclear power plant opened in the U.S. since the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was created in 1975? Why has the FDA been so slow to approve new therapeutics, tests, and so many other essential goods during the pandemic? In these cases, regulation is the bottleneck holding back private companies from making investments.They note some successes of federal R&D. The utter failure of NASA's heavy-lift relative to Space-X seems like useful caution. They suggest \"pull mechanisms,\" like prizes. But the deeper question is, why do agencies not use pull mechanisms.\u00a0The share of US GDP for farming is 0.9 percent and all agriculture is ~5 percent. Iowa with the highest share is ~10 percent and more GDP comes from Iowa's research labs than ag. I do an occasional survey with students, colleagues, friends and family and every single one says the share of CA ag gdp is ~ 50 percent and that of Indiana is 60 percent etc. (2.5 & 5 percents respectively). There is no red or blue bias here! All are way off! So during the next primaries, instead of pandering to farmers in Iowa (only 900K independent farmers left in the US and Archer Daniels Midlands type ag companies run 70 percent of farms now), maybe our pols should says how valuable an H1B visa is and how incredibly lucky the US is that it can corner the market of innovative and productive people into its geographic sphere. And just ask any student applying for MIT if they would take up a job or raise a family in Beijing. China or even the US can never replicate the US of the late 20-early 21st century. But the US can maintain the market for innovation and productivity by continuing to do what is does right now i.e. attract global talent.Sclerosis. Does not look good. Of course the source of the problem is in interest groups and the bureaucracy. Or us! The Reagan revolution has been all but forgotten. Even something as fundamental as the Thatcher revolution in Britain soon petered out.A peaceful revolution has the best chance of starting and winning here. 'Total factor productivity' is not a meaningful metric.  If F(K,L) is the production function for the economy, total factor productivity is F(K,L)/(K)/(L) = A(K,L). Total factor productivity growth is dA(K,L)/A(K,L)dt = d(ln(A(K,L))/dt = d(ln(F(K,L)-ln(K)-ln(L))/dt.  Suppose F(K,L) = a K^b L^c, then dA(K,L)/A(K,L)dt =  da(t)/a(t)dt + (b-1)dK(t)/K(t)dt + (c-1)dL(t)/L(t)dt = g(t), in the most general case.  And,  K = K1 + K2 + ... + Kn + ..., and, L = L1 + L2 + ... + Ln + ... if K and L are linear combinations of Ki and Li, i = 1, 2, ... , n, ... . But, if capital Ki and Li are not separable, in this sense, then F(K,L) = F1(K1,L1) + F2(K2,L2) + ... etc., and for a society that produces intermediate and primary products in addition to final products, and uses inputs from overseas (imports factor inputs) in addition to domestic inputs, the interrelationships between capital and labor become difficult to untangle.  The automobile manufacturing industry is a case in point.  It is said that inputs of intermediate products that make up the final product will cross the Canada-US border several times before becoming integrated in the final product in the US. Disentangling the inputs into such intermediate products is difficult, and the \"total factor productivity\" for such factor inputs is consequently difficult to define.  The economist doesn't try to do so--she makes an estimate (a best guess, in most instances) and plugs a number into her spreadsheet model that then crunches the data and presto-magico out pops a number referred to as \"TFP\".  The production environment has become considerably more complex than ever it was in the 1970s.  In addition, much of the production is subcontracted overseas while the so-called \"high value-added\" work is performed domestically (without producing physical product, e.g., \"widgets\").  Most of the semiconductor chips are designed in \"fab-less\" design centers while the chips themselves are produced overseas in \"fabs\" (Taiwan Semi, etc.)  The drive is towards zero labor factor inputs onshore, and the transfer of capital intensive production to offshore centers where labor inputs are less expensive.  GDP is an imperfect measure in those cases.  GNP may capture more of total national output, but imperfectly as well.The control engineers would say, with some justification, \"If you can't measure it, you can't control it.\"  But, if you're going to measure it, you may as well understand what it is you are measuring because it could be the wrong measure, a.s.Suppose one could accurately measure \"TFP\", precisely.  Would that be a sufficient condition, or simply a necessary condition (perhaps one of many necessary conditions).  Suppose this new \"think tank\" staff thought it was a sufficient condition, when it was only a necessary condition, and then went ahead and published its findings and drew up a list of recommended societal changes (actions) based on those (incorrect) findings. What damage or mischief might come of out of that?  Enthusiasm is one thing (necessary, perhaps, but never sufficient), and \"Web 3.0\" is generating enthusiasm in some quarters, as an example, yet I can't help but think that there are too many \"big-picture thinkers\" these days, (too many chiefs) relative to worker bees.OEE,\"The control engineers would say, with some justification, If you can't measure it, you can't control it.  But, if you're going to measure it, you may as well understand what it is you are measuring because it could be the wrong measure, a.s.\"Absolutely.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity\"The word total suggests all inputs have been measured. Official statisticians tend to use the term multifactor productivity (MFP) instead of TFP because some inputs such as energy are usually not included.\"\"External costs including attributes of the workforce, public infrastructure such as highways and environmental sustainability costs such as mineral depletion and pollution are not traditionally included.\"\"On the basis of dimensional analysis, TFP has been criticized as lacking meaningful units of measurement.  The units of the quantities in the Cobb\u2013Douglas equation are:A: (widgets * year\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2013 1)/(caphr\u03b1 * manhr\u03b2), a balancing quantity, which is TFP\"In this construction the units of A would not have a simple economic interpretation, and the concept of TFP appear to be a modeling artifact.\"A \"better\" measure of productivity would simply be Real GDP / Total Credit Market Debt Outstanding.  The units are widgets per nominal dollar of debt and both Real GDP and total debt outstanding are measurable quantities.Further, regarding your control engineer notation, a government (in particular a Treasury) CAN regulate the amount of debt that it issues irregardless of the wishes of the Legislature.See John's opening statements above:\"We need to be reminded occasionally that nothing matters but long-run growth, and long-run growth all comes from productivity, better knowledge of how to better serve human needs and desires.\"Not exactly.Productivity is a ratio (similar to efficiency in mechanical / electrical systems).With either TFP or Real GDP / TCMDO, maximizing productivity does not in and of itself maximize real growth, in the same way that maximizing the mechanical / electrical efficiency of a system does not necessarily maximize the total output of that system.Productivity is important because improvements in productivity are non-rivalrous - meaning I don't need to compete with my neighbor for scarce real resources to improve the amount of output that I am generating using what is already available to me.See Non-Rivalrous goods:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)\"A good is considered non-rivalrous or non-rival if, for any level of production, the cost of providing it to a marginal (additional) individual is zero.  Economist Paul Samuelson made the distinction between private and public goods in 1954 by introducing the concept of nonrival consumption. Economist Richard Musgrave followed on and added rivalry and excludability as criteria for defining consumption goods in 1959 and 1969.\"Country A has an endowment of 1000 tons of iron ore uses that ore to produce 1000 motorized vehicles (1 car per ton).Country B has an endowment of 5000 tons of iron ore and uses that ore to produce 3000 equivalent motorized vehicles (0.6 cars per ton).Even though country B has produced more cars (more real output), country A has a more productive society (more output for a given level of input).Wars are started when countries focus on maximizing output (using goods obtained in conquest) rather than maximizing productivity.\"Productivity\" = output per unit of factor inputs.  If Y equals the output of a Cobb-Douglas production function, F(K,L; A, a, b) = A.K^a.L^b, A>0, a >0, b >0, then, total factor productivity is given by F/(K^a.L^b) = A.  Thus, \"total factor productivity\" equals the constant of proportionality, A.  This is a tautology, i.e., \"a statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form\" (Oxford Dictionary).\"Productivity growth\" is then (dA(t)/dt)/A(t) and this can be written in terms of factor inputs K and L. Hence, dA(t)/A(t) = dY(t)/Y(t) - a.dK(t)/K(t) - b.dL(t)/L(t), using the chain-rule of differentiation.  Productivity growth is non-dimensional.  Suppose the labor supply is growing at the rate of dL(t)/L(t) = n(t).  Further, suppose economic growth is given by g(t) = dY(t)/Y(t).  Then,       productivity growth is given by          dA(t)/A(t) = g(t) - b.n(t) - a.dK(t)/K(t).  Suppose dK(t) = -m.K(t).dt + Y(t).dt - C(t).dt, where C(t) is total consumption, all quantities expressed in units of the output commondity for consistency. Then,       productivity growth is  given by         dA(t)/A(t) = g(t) -b.n(t) - a.m + Y(t)/K(t) - C(t)/K(t). Let, y(t) = Y(t)/L(t), c(t) = Y(t)/L(t), and k(t) = K(t)/L(t).  Total factor productivity growth can be expressed as follows,        dA(t)/A(t) = g(t) -b.n(t) -a.m +[y(t) - c(t)].k(t)       (1)In words, {TFP growth} = {economic growth rate, g} minus [{share of labor, b} x {labor growth rate, n}] minus [{share of capital, a} x {capital depreciation rate, m}] + [{net capital investment per unit of labor, y - c} x {capital:labor ration, k}].Any estimation of TFP growth must include the specification of the production function assumed in constructing the regression model.Note, in the Cobb-Douglas production function specification, that TFP has units of the output commodity divided by the product of {units of capital}^a and {units of labor}^b, in order to be consistent with the assumed form of the production function.  The Wikipedia author's criticism is nonsensical.This simple model (incorrectly stated in my original comment posted above) belies the actual complexity of a modern open economy (exports and imports omitted), as noted in that comment.Because the definition of total factor productivity is a tautology, it is not uniquely defined, but depends on the mathematical model of the assumed production function. Labor productivity, per se, is only valid for a specific level of capital employed.  It is a universal metric but its usefulness is limited.  Likewise with capital productivity.The marginal product of capital is (r + m) on the optimal growth trajectory; likewise, the marginal product of labor is w on the optimal growth trajectory. Off the optimal growth trajectory, marginal products are lower (by definition)Determining which of Society A and Society B is \"more productive\" is more complicated than illustrated in your example.  Consider: A BMW Isetta uses less steel per vehicle than does a Suburban, but the Suburban can carry more cargo and passengers per trip-mile than an Isetta can. Which is the \"more productive\" depends on the nature of the product (passenger trip-miles per unit time per vehicle, for example).  It may be \"more productive\" for Society A and Society B to export their iron ore resources to Society C which has scale economies in the production of \"cars\", and import such mixes of \"cars\" as best suits their individual social welfare utility functions.  Simple statistics are rarely, if ever, conclusive in determining the winner of \"more productive\" comparisons.\"Determining which of Society A and Society B is more productive is more complicated than illustrated in your example. Consider: A BMW Isetta uses less steel per vehicle than does a Suburban, but the Suburban can carry more cargo and passengers per trip-mile than an Isetta can.\"I presume that in calculations of Real GDP (widgets), the Suburban counts as more widgets than does an Isetta via hedonic adjustment?See my orginal postulation - \"Country B has an endowment of 5000 tons of iron ore and uses that ore to produce 3000 EQUIVALENT motorized vehicles (0.6 cars per ton).\"My example was written to illustrate the point out that maximizing real economic growth (Real GDP) and maximizing productivity (ratio of Real GDP and inputs) are not the same thing.If Russia does invade the Ukraine and re-absorb it, Russian national Real GDP will likely rise (more workers, more resources, more output).  Net Russian productivity may not rise with it.If your example \"was written to illustrate the point out that maximizing real economic growth (Real GDP) and maximizing productivity (ratio of Real GDP and inputs) are not the same thing\", it didn't achieve that end.  To wit,Economic growth is dY(t)/Y(t)/dt.  Productivity is Y(t)/[K(t)^a L(t)^b]= A(t).  The former is the time rate of change of economic activity per unit of economic activity.  The latter is the ratio of economic activity to the factor inputs utilized to generate that activity (e.g., your example) at a specific instant in time.  The time rate of change of productivity, (i.e., productivity growth) dA(t)/A(t)/dt, is the quantity that is of interest to economists.  Suppose that in period t = 0, productivity is A(0) and output is Y(0) = F(K(0),L(0)) = A(0).[K(0)^a.L(0)^b], where, a + b = 1 (i.e., constant economies of scale).  Now, suppose that you have a brilliant idea on a means to improve productivity in period t = 1, and suppose you are correct and your idea is put to practice resulting in improved productivity, i.e., A(1) > A(0).  Suppose that capital, K, and labor, L, in period t =1 is unchanged from period t =0, i.e., K(1) = K(0), and L(1) = L(0).  What happens to output in period t = 1?  Output should increase, i.e., Y(1) > Y(0) in the ratio A(1)/A(0), ceteris paribus.  In this example, productivity growth, ln(A(1)) - ln(A(0)), to a first approximation, leads to output growth, ln(Y(1)) - ln(Y(0)), in equal measure, ceteris paribus.Suppose that your goal is not to increase output, but to reduce factor inputs.  How would you achieve that purpose?  Ans. -- reduce K, and L is proportion to the increase in A.  Note that the sum of the exponents is equal to 1, in the assumption at the beginning of this comment.  One such evolution, that achieves your goal, is given by Y(1) = Y(0), A(1) > A(0), K(1) < K(0), and L(1) < L(0) such that K(1)/K(0) = [A(0)/A(1)]^(1/a) and L(1)/L(0) = [A(0)/A(1)]^(1/b).  You might pursue that goal if your output with the productivity improvement exceeds the demand for your output in the goods or services marketplace in period t = 1, for example. Typically, though, the economists prefer to view productivity growth as a driver for societal welfare improvement, especially when net popuation growth is positive, whether by natural increase or a combination of natural increase and increase in net immigration.We need to be reminded that what matters most is equanimity, understanding at the experiential level the transient nature of existence \u2013 particles arising and passing away with great rapidity, nothing to cling to, no \u201cI, me, mine,\u201d giving us the ability to face every moment with a peaceful mind.My other comment not withstanding, I generally agree with your article.  About 30 years ago I surveyed a wide range of econometric studies on the optimal level of government for GDP growth: almost all studies found 22% optimal, none was far from that.  My experience as a government economic policy adviser in the UK and Australia suggests that governments are increasingly intrusive, and public servants increasingly obstructive.  The best governments here - under Hawke (ALP) and Howard (Liberal)- had ministers with wide experience of life, an openness to ideas and a genuine interest in public welfare.  Now we have mainly careerists.  The situation in many/most Australian universities is also dire, with woke left-wing ideas dominant.Michael,\"The best governments here - under Hawke (ALP) and Howard (Liberal)- had ministers with wide experience of life, an openness to ideas and a genuine interest in public welfare.\"Is our education system designed to provide that \"wide experience of life\" or has it become a toxic mix of specialization and career advancement through affiliation (political party, race, sexual orientation, or other)?Current Wealth comes being FIRST in line for the WAVE of CASH being printed!

We have the most educated laborforce in history, and the availability of labor worldwide; we are not utilizing a resource that is right before us.We are more of a service sector economy now so maybe we need to reorganize our business structures -- maybe try going back to hierarchical organizations with an international/national reach -- and also expand the tech capabilities in the service sectors.https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=LbN7This measure of productivity is a farce.If government pays people not to work then hours worked fall and productivity \"improves\" through fewer hours worked.

Another big question, then, is whether it will use its awesome power to advance climate or social policies. For example, it could deny credit to fossil-fuel companies, demand that banks lend only to companies with certified net-zero emissions plans, or steer credit to favored alternatives. It also could decide that it will start regulating explicitly in the name of equality or racial justice, by telling banks where and to whom to lend, whom to hire and fire, and so forth.&nbsp;</p><p>But before considering where the Fed\u2019s regulation will or should go, we first need to account for the Fed\u2019s grand failure. In 2008, the US government made a consequential decision: Financial institutions could continue to get the money they use to make risky investments largely by selling run-prone short-term debt, but a new army of regulators would judge the riskiness of the institutions\u2019 assets. The hope was that regulators would not miss any more subprime-mortgage-size elephants on banks\u2019 balance sheets.

Critics had long pointed to problems with the Fed\u2019s liquidity rules, and fixing these markets would have been simple, but obvious reforms had languished. Later, there was a run on money market funds. The Fed bailed out money market funds once again. There is nothing simpler to fix than money-market runs, but the fix never happened.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fed also funded new municipal-bond issues and propped up corporate bond prices, essentially offering a whatever-it-takes guarantee.

That the Fed was totally surprised by today\u2019s inflation indicates a fundamental failure. Surely, some institutional soul searching is called for.\u00a0Yet, while interest-rate policies get headlines, the Fed is now most consequential as a financial regulator. Another big question, then, is whether it will use its awesome power to advance climate or social policies. For example, it could deny credit to fossil-fuel companies, demand that banks lend only to companies with certified net-zero emissions plans, or steer credit to favored alternatives. It also could decide that it will start regulating explicitly in the name of equality or racial justice, by telling banks where and to whom to lend, whom to hire and fire, and so forth.\u00a0But before considering where the Fed\u2019s regulation will or should go, we first need to account for the Fed\u2019s grand failure. In 2008, the US government made a consequential decision: Financial institutions could continue to get the money they use to make risky investments largely by selling run-prone short-term debt, but a new army of regulators would judge the riskiness of the institutions\u2019 assets. The hope was that regulators would not miss any more subprime-mortgage-size elephants on banks\u2019 balance sheets. Yet in the ensuing decade of detailed regulation and regular scenario-based \u201cstress tests,\u201d the Fed\u2019s regulatory army did not once consider, \u201cWhat if there is a pandemic?\u201d\u00a0When a pandemic did arrive in early 2020, the Fed repudiated the \u201cnever again\u201d promises of 2008, this time intervening on an even larger scale. That March, the dealer banks proved unable to intermediate the market for plain-vanilla US Treasury securities. So, the Fed propped up the market. Critics had long pointed to problems with the Fed\u2019s liquidity rules, and fixing these markets would have been simple, but obvious reforms had languished. Later, there was a run on money market funds. The Fed bailed out money market funds once again. There is nothing simpler to fix than money-market runs, but the fix never happened.\u00a0The Fed also funded new municipal-bond issues and propped up corporate bond prices, essentially offering a whatever-it-takes guarantee. In 2008, the Fed and the Department of the Treasury had balked at the idea of raising the market price of all mortgages under the Troubled Assets Relief Program. Yet in 2020, the \u201cPowell put\u201d had established an explicit floor for corporate bond prices \u2013 and more.\u00a0The predictable rejoinder to this critique will be: So what? The COVID-19 lockdowns might well have triggered a financial crisis. The flood of bailouts worked, so much so that our problem today is inflation. We do not need to worry about systemic risk, because the Fed and the Treasury will just put out any new fires with oceans of new money.\u00a0The problem, of course, is the incentives these policies have created. Why bother keeping cash or balance-sheet space to buy on the dip, provide liquidity, or treat a \u201cfire sale\u201d as a \u201cbuying opportunity?\u201d The Fed will just front-run you and take away the profit. If you are a company, why issue stock when you can just borrow, knowing that the government will prop up your debt or bail you out, as it did for the airlines? If you are an investor, why hesitate to buy shaky debt, knowing that its value will be guaranteed by another \u201cwhatever-it-takes\u201d commitment from the Fed in bad times?\u00a0No wonder America is awash in debt. Everyone assumes that taxpayers will take on losses in the next downturn. Student loans, government pensions, and mortgages have piled up, all waiting their turn for Uncle Sam\u2019s bailout. But each crisis requires larger and larger transfusions. Bond investors eventually will refuse to hand over more wealth for bailouts, and people will not want to hold trillions in newly printed cash. When the bailout that everyone expects fails to materialize, we will wake up in a town on fire \u2013 and the firehouse has burned down.\u00a0In 2008, regulators and legislators at least had the sense to recognize moral hazard, and to worry that investors gain in good times while taxpayers cover losses in bad times. But the 2020 blowout has been greeted only with self-congratulation.\u00a0The same Fed that missed the subprime-mortgage risks in 2008, the pandemic in 2020, and that now wishes to stress-test \u201cclimate risks,\u201d will surely miss the next war, pandemic, sovereign default, or other major disruptive event. Fed regulators aren\u2019t even asking the latter questions. And while they issue word salads about \u201cinterconnections,\u201d \u201cstrategic interactions,\u201d \u201cnetwork effects,\u201d and \u201ccredit cycles,\u201d they still have not defined what \u201csystemic\u201d risk even is, other than a catch-all term to grant regulators all-encompassing power.\u00a0Regulators will never be able to foresee risks, artfully calibrate financial institutions\u2019 assets, or ensure that immense debts can always be paid. We need to reverse the basic premise of a financial system in which the government always guarantees mountains of debt in bad times, and we need to do it before the firehouse is put to the test.\u00a0Better regulation can bridge partisan divides. The left is correct that big banks are inefficient oligopolies that serve most Americans poorly. But it has the cause wrong. An immense regulatory compliance burden is a major barrier to market entry.\u00a0Calls for \u201cmore\u201d regulation are meaningless. Regulations are either smart or dumb, effective or ineffective, full of undesired consequences or well designed. We need better regulation. We need more capital, not many more thousands of pages of rules. Capital provides a buffer against all shocks, and it does not require regulators to be clairvoyant. The Fed has scandalously blocked narrow-banking enterprises and payments providers that could help serve many Americans\u2019 financial needs.\u00a0Before turning to healing the planet and righting injustice, the Fed should be held to account for how badly it is doing on the basic task of protecting the financial system.\u00a0Why is price stability the Fed's main mandate? Certainly it's an important but so is managing unemployment. If the Fed wants to get into social engineering, I propose the Fed outlaw banking in those states that do not outlaw property zoning.The cost of housing in America is ruinous, and it stems in large part from property zoning and scarce supply.I beg to differ. Housing costs have skyrocketed because of the cost of building a house (replacement costs)When the cost of a permit to replace a wall heater is greater than the cost of the heater, this rather basic event indicates how building regulations and codes are out of control and consequently raise the price of building a new house.There's plenty of land so zoning is not an issue. The cost of developing the land due to government regulations is the problemSure, many regs make a mess, but in some cities, such as L.A., 70% of land is zoned single-family detached. What the West Coast needs is forests of 60-story condo towers, right where people want to live. You can build 60-story condo tower outside Palmdale. There is plenty of land. Mr. Cole, you vastly overestimate the attractiveness of living in one of a \"forest\" of 60-story condo towers.  Not everyone is single without children and looking for a cave to hide in.It's not just the zoning - in many cities with highest home price appreciation water and sewer capacity is very limited.  This capacity is very expensive and cannot be added in small increments - and many of those cities are in such dire financial straits it would be very challenging economically and politically to sell bonds to pay for services for new development.The Fed is not, should not, and cannot be responsible for local zoning laws or failure to upgrade local infrastructure. California has ample tax income to fund any and all necessary infrastructure; it simply chooses not to fund it. As for Fed policy, debt reduces flexibility. Massive debt eliminates flexibility. As John states, humans and human institutions, including the Fed, are not clairvoyant. So building fragile structures is a failed strategy. Will we ever learn? No, probably not. In the USA, political expediency reigns supreme. Weimar, here we come.  \"... the Fed should be held to account for how badly it is doing on the basic task of protecting the financial system.\"  While I am sympathetic to the general thrust of this essay, I have to conclude with the observation that the Scotch verdict \"Not proved\" applies in this case.The Federal Reserve itself says there are 4 major areas of responsibility, none of which is to influence climate change or social policies. The first is: \"Conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of full employment and stable prices.\"I am archiving their current FAQ for posterity because in the future, their stated mission likely will include climate change and social policies. Great column. One question: the left wants more regulation, but the answer is more capital. Touche. What does the right want?sadly the richest don't get tired of wealth accumulation unlike times past where people like Carnegie, Rockefeller, etc actually built business...then set about helping others. Henry Ford paid his employees to make sure they could afford his car.Today's wall street...the recipient of MORE THAN $9 trillion of FED Lagress...is unlimitedly glutenous with a raw hatred of most of America and actually little interest in business and its success! Government today isn't to help people and businesses...it is to enrich select cronies and itself using unlimited power and DEBT! Sadly I believe the next downturn with be a once in 100 year Event!-->\"Henry Ford paid his employees to make sure they could afford his car.\"Sorry to say, but that's an apocryphal story. Ford had 100% daily labor turnover at the pay rate originally offered. He had to raise pay for the extremely boring assembly line work. Ford paid his employees to stop quitting. The end result was they could afford to buy his car.The last three downturns were 100 year events (as measured relying on Gaussian statistics)--no reason the next downturn won't be. Cheers.The difficulty for the Fed going forward in an environment of higher inflation, higher interest rates, and probably higher growth rates, is the balancing act it will have to do between tapping the breaks on our domestic economy if inflation rates climb versus the financial funding accommodation the international markets will need to keep functioning.  Don\u2019t forget that before the pandemic hit, in the Autumn of 2019, our Fed had to intervene when the financial intermediaries (banks) could not meet the run for cash/cash equivalents.  With actors pulling at both ends of the monetary policy rope for tightening and loosening, the Fed will have a delicate tap dance satisfying its impetuous players.Currently inflation is the illness. Interest rates the castor oil. Any delay taking the medicine prolongs the illness. Worry about other things when circumstances improve.The Fed getting into areas where they have no business scares the bejeebers out of me. Perhaps they are moving into these areas because they can't cover their main task (price stability) and want to feel good about themselves? Pitiful.Plain manila Taylor rules put current interest rate targets over 8 percent.

These people are not our best and brightest.I give John credit for tight walking through a nasty minefield. Because any disagreement, even in the mildest form, could be misconstrued. Perhaps that's the point.I will be less artful. One can and should question the motivations behind these specific choices without it impugning women, women of color, or their qualifications in the field of economics. I'll go ahead and say it more cleanly. This smells of virtue signaling in the worst way.As a former FRBNY officer, some thoughts:1. Classically, the horizon for climate change would normally allow the repricing of contracts to reflect the risk (absent some very tail probability like the collapse of the ice shelf and the reversal of the Gulf Stream.2. Climate change is a classic externality, one that is global in scope.  The collective governments have agreed to address by committing to carbon reduction goals.3. In the best of all worlds, this would be done transparently through legislation.4. We all know that we do not live in such a world.5. By nominating Raskin, I don't think you can say it is \"beyond what the Administration is willing to do.\"6. I would prefer to directly raise the cost of carbon (either through exchanges or taxes), but this may be a 'next best' solution.7.  Do not let the best be the enemy of the good.8. Prepare for the 2nd order consequences of this action.I think the natural retort would be:This feels like a overreach of the feds stated powers. The whole reason the Fed avoids checks and balances of traditional government is because it has a limited and transparent scope of power. The FED is also supposed to be apolitical, but it sure doesn't feel that way.Politics and economics go together like peanut butter and jelly, but often don't have the same taste every time. There's no escaping or separating these two critical functions of society. To me this isn't about the Fed picking winners or losers per se. It's inevitable there's toe smashing in the attempt to have the illusion of stability, with as little variation as possible. Utopia, yes?This comment has been removed by the author.Your critique of Dr. Cook needs some work. First you say her record is too thin - and then you say she's doing too much and that you're bewildered by how much she's doing. So, which is it? You cherry picked her research to avoid mentioning all she's done that is clearly in line with the Fed's mandate. Do you think Milton Friedman made a mistake by backing her research? Or, did that fact not fit with your fairy tale. I can't find anything she's written about mandating DEI and ESG at banks. Your implication that her work \"might mean\" she supports those things is utterly silly. As for this notion you led with that some journalists called you and asked for your views on Dr. Cook - well, why not name them? What an odd and truly weird hack job. May your feet never touch the ground, John. John obviously struck a nerve... I have a lot of complaints about the Fed; usually its been too tight.The Fed has a thousand economists, but there is never a clear discussion of whether a larger balance sheet is inflationary, or actually anti-inflationary in that it increases investor confidence in the federal government ability to meet debts.I might even wonder if it is better to create money through money-financed fiscal programs, rather than through greater government borrowing or more commercial bank lending.And yet even I think these three choices for the Federal Reserve board are absolutely crummy, for the reasons suggested in this excellent blog.Hell, it's the commanding heights! Been there, done that.May the Lord have mercy on our souls.What is Spacial Racism ?  Is it discrimination against Martians ? The Fed doesn't do well what it should be doing.  Can we  hope that it will do at least as well what it shouldn't be doing? Hi Dr. Cochrane - I hope all is well.  I had your Investments course at the GSB in '97 (or '98?).  It was a great class.  I wanted to ask about the comment, above, \"The idea of climate risk to the financial system is, in my view...farcical\".  I know it's certainly the case that climate change can affect companies and industries so I wanted to ask, what are the criteria for something to have a material, adverse risk to the stability of the whole system.  Is it the potential for some x% change in liquidity or prices across the U.S. market (that quickly \"infects\" world markets), or the world market in general, that persists for a certain time?  How quickly does it have to happen?  As an example, would it have to be something like the crisis in 2008 but that was precipitated by a climate disaster?  It would be helpful to get a sense for what the magnitudes would have to be for people to agree it was due to \"climate change\" (whether that's a mega-disaster or series of disasters or some quantifiable trend).Thanks, Matt  Click on the energy or environment links. I went on and on over the last few months on the topic of climate financial risks. On its own, this is too brusque a sentence, you are right, but there is a lot behind it. Thanks - I'll check it out. (This was my first foray to the Grumpy Economist blog!)\"The idea of climate risk to the financial system is, in my view (and my reading of the scientific literature) so farcical that I called this out as a subterfuge.\" You are a theoretical economist, I wouldn't expect you to understand the scientific literature of climate change well enough to derive its risk to financial system (which also requires empirical grounding, something you seem to lack). I do have one addition here. The FT, as no doubt others, notes the critical lack of banks in minority communities. The Chicago Fed has fsimilar finding in its study of Detroit. Without banking services and loans, local business in minority communities find it difficult to scale their businesses and build wealth. At the time I read this the Chicago Fed asked for local community representatives to serve on an advisory board. I immediately thought of the North Lawndale community which is in partnership with Old St Pat's RC church. Speaking with Rodney Brown, a top official in North Lawndale's comprehensive community organization, they even have a Chamber of Commerce and a banking committee, I learn that North Lawndale just got its first bank in 20 years! Wintrust located in the neighborhood this past April. For these  reasons, as well as others, Lisa Cook brings an important perspective to the Fed - that of ample financial services in minority communities to support local businesses, hence growth and wealth building.\"...thinktank essays listed under publications\" lol.Comments are welcome.

The Treasury sent out checks, transferring the reserves to people\u2019s banks. See Table 1.) &nbsp;The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so, and sent more checks.

But is it monetary or fiscal policy? Ask yourself: Suppose the expansion of M2 had been entirely financed by purchasing Treasury securities. Imagine Treasury debt had declined $5 trillion while M2 and reserves rose $5 trillion. Imagine that there had been no deficit at all, or even a surplus during this period. The monetary theory of inflation, MV=PY, states that we would see the same inflation. Really? <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Similarly, ask yourself: Suppose that the Federal Reserve had refused to go along. Suppose that the Treasury had sent people Treasury bills directly, accounts at Treasury.gov, along with directions how to sell them if people wished to do so. Better, suppose that the Treasury had created new mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and sent people mutual fund shares. (I write mutual fund as money market funds are counted in M2.) The monetary theory of inflation says again that this would have had no effect. These would be a debt issue, causing no inflation, not a monetary expansion. Really?&nbsp;<span></span></p><a name=\"more\"></a><p></p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Clearly, overall debt matters, not the split of government debt between interest-paying reserves or monetary base and Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve itself is nothing more than an immense money-market fund, offering shares that are pegged at $1 each, pay interest, and are backed by a portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. (Plus, an army of regulators and a huge staff of economists who are supposed to help forecast inflation.)&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Milton Friedman\u2019s (1969) helicopter drop is a powerful parable. But a helicopter drop is a fiscal policy, not a monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve may not legally drop money from helicopters; it may not write checks to voters. The Fed may even less vacuum up money; it may not tax people. Helicopter drops and money vacuums are fiscal operations. The Fed may only lend money, or buy and sell assets. To accomplish a helicopter drop in the United States, the Treasury must issue debt, the Fed must buy it with newly printed money, and then the Treasury must drop that money from helicopters, writing it down as a transfer payment. And that is pretty much exactly what happened.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Ask yourself: If, as Friedman\u2019s helicopter is dropping $1,000 on each household, the Fed sends burglars who remove $1,000 of Treasury securities from the same households, would we still see inflation? That\u2019s monetary policy. If Friedman\u2019s helicopter were followed by the Treasury secretary with a bullhorn, shouting \u201cEnjoy your $1,000 in helicopter money. Taxes are going up $1,000 tomorrow,\u201d would we still see inflation?&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Friedman\u2019s helicopters are not a monetary change, a substitution of money for debt, an increase in the liquidity of a given set of household assets. They are a \u201cwealth effect\u201d of government debt. Dropping debt from helicopters is a brilliant psychological device for convincing people that the government debt raining down on them will not be repaid by future taxes or spending restraint. It will be left outstanding, so they had better spend it now.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, we just witnessed a \u201chelicopter drop.\u201d But a helicopter drop is fiscal policy.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Why did fiscal inflation not happen sooner? The government has been borrowing money like the proverbial drunken sailor, for decades. The Fed has been buying Treasury securities and turning the debt into reserves for a decade. Why now?</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Inflation comes when government debt increases, relative to people\u2019s expectations of what the government will repay. If the Treasury borrows, but everyone understands it will later raise tax revenues or cut spending to repay the debt, that debt does not cause inflation. It is a good investment, and people are happy to hold on to it. If the Fed prints up a lot of money, buys Treasury debt, and the Treasury hands out the money, as happened, but everyone understands the Treasury will pay back the debt with future surpluses, the extra money causes no inflation. The Fed can always soak up the money by selling its Treasury securities, and the Treasury repays those securities with surpluses (i.e., taxes less spending).&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>The 2020\u20132021 borrowing and money episode was distinctive because, evidently, it came without a corresponding increase in expectations that the government would, someday, raise surpluses by $5 trillion in present value to repay the debt. &nbsp;Looking in to people\u2019s heads is hard, but why? We can at least find some plausible speculations.&nbsp;</p><p>One may look to politicians\u2019 statements. Even in the Obama-era \u201cstimulus\u201d spending, the administration emphasized promises of eventual debt reduction. One may chuckle and sneer at promises to repay debts decades after an administration leaves office, but at least they went through the motions to make that promise! Nobody went through any motions about long-run fiscal planning, long-run deficit reduction, and entitlement and tax reform, in 2020\u20132021. &nbsp;It was the era of modern monetary theory (MMT), of costless \u201cfiscal expansion\u201d made possible, or so it was claimed, by the manna-from-heaven that interest rates would stay low forever.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>The manner of fiscal expansion matters too. When the Treasury borrows in the usual manner, it borrows from established long-term investors, who view Treasury debt as debt that will be repaid and not defaulted or inflated. They view it as a savings or investment vehicle, not as cash to be spent. They save, or invest, based on long and so-far mostly successful experience. This time, following canary-in-the-coal mine disruptions in Treasury markets during March 2020, the Federal Reserve immediately bought new Treasury debt with newly created money, before it even touched these investor\u2019s portfolios. The effect of the operation was to print new money and send people checks, so the debt issue is now held as bank deposits flowing into reserves, rather than as Treasury securities. People holding this new money are likely to spend it rather than regard it as a long-term investment. &nbsp;In our simplest economic models, it does not matter who holds the debt. But in just a little more nuanced view, who holds the debt matters.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>In our simplest economic models, interest-paying reserves and Treasuries are equivalent securities. But people likely do see a difference between reserves and short-run Treasuries. Treasuries may well carry a reputation that they will be repaid, while people assume reserves will not be repaid by larger surpluses. Then issuing lots of reserves rather than Treasuries is inflationary, but not because the reserves are ``money,\u2019\u2019 but rather because they convey a different set of fiscal expectations, just as dropping money or debt from helicopters sends a different signal about repayment than issuing debt at a Treasury auction.</p><p>Most of the previous operations financed government spending or government worker salaries, counting on higher incomes to slowly filter through the economy. This one sent checks directly to people. &nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Finally, this fiscal stimulus was enormous, and carried out on a deep misdiagnosis of the state of the economy. Even in simplistic hydraulic Keynesian terms, $5 trillion times any multiplier is much larger than any plausible GDP gap. And the Covid recession was not due to a demand deficiency in the first place. A pandemic is, to the economy, like a huge snowstorm. Sending people money will not get them to go out to closed bars, restaurants, airlines, and businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cStimulus,\u201d \u201caccommodation,\u201d \u201ceasing\u201d was the point. This method finally worked, where previous stimulus efforts failed. One can see several suggestive differences, which amount to important economic lessons.</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>What about \u201csupply shocks?\u201d What about a shift of demand from services to durables? Much analysis misses the difference between relative prices and inflation, in which all prices and wages rise together. A supply shock makes one good more expensive than others. Only demand makes all goods rise together. There wouldn\u2019t be \u201csupply chain\u201d problems if people were not trying to buy things like mad! A shift in demand from services to durables can make durable prices go up. But it would make services prices go down. And let us not even go down the ridiculous path of blaming inflation on a sudden contagious outbreak of \u201cgreed\u201d and \u201ccollusion\u201d by businesses from oil companies to turkey farmers, needing the administration to send the FTC out to investigate.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>It is telling that inflation was a complete surprise to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve\u2019s job is supposed to be to monitor the supply capacity of the economy and to make sure demand does not outstrip it. &nbsp;The Fed failed twice. First, the economy did not need demand-side stimulus. Insurance was wise, and forestalling a financial crisis was necessary. But sending money to every citizen to stoke demand was not. Second, the Fed being surprised by supply shocks is as excusable as the Army losing a battle because its leaders are surprised that the enemy might attack. &nbsp;As we see by the outcome, the Fed\u2019s understanding of supply, largely based on statistical analysis of labor markets, is rudimentary.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp; WilI Inflation Continue?&nbsp;</b></p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>If the government borrows or prints $5 trillion, with no change in its plan to repay debt, on top of $17 trillion outstanding debt, then the price level will rise a cumulative 30 percent, so that the $22 trillion of debt is worth in real terms what the $17 trillion was before. In essence, absent a credible increase in future surpluses, the deficit is financed by defaulting on $5 trillion of outstanding debt, via inflation. By this calculation, the 6 percent or so cumulative inflation we have seen so far leaves a way to go. &nbsp;But people may think some of the debt will be repaid. If they think half will eventually be repaid, then the price level need only rise 15 percent overall.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>But then it stops. A one-time unbacked debt increase leads to a one-time price-level increase, not continuing inflation. Whether inflation continues or not depends on future &nbsp;monetary policy, future fiscal policy, and whether people change their minds about overall debt repayment. &nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Fiscal policy may not be done with us yet. If unbacked fiscal expansions continue\u2014that is, borrowing when people do not expect additional repayment\u2014then additional bouts of fiscal inflation will occur. Untold trillions of spending, including new entitlements, with no realistic hope of raising tax revenues commensurately to cover them are certainly high on the Biden administration\u2019s agenda. (Higher tax rates do not necessarily mean higher revenues, if economic growth falters; and even so the proposed taxes do not cover the proposed spending increases even with static scoring.) The mentality that borrowed money need never be repaid, because the MMT fairy or r&lt;g magic makes debt free, remains strong in Washington. &nbsp;But the failure of the so-called \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan may augur well for budget seriousness and a limit to ill-constructed social policies with strong supply disincentives.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>The most troublesome question remains: Do people, having decided that at least some of our government\u2019s new debt will not be repaid, so they should spend it now and inflate it away, now think that the government is less likely to repay its existing debts, or less likely to repay future borrowing? If so, even more inflation can break out, seemingly (as always) out of nowhere.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Fiscal Constraints on Monetary Policy&nbsp;</b></p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Fiscal and monetary policies are always intertwined in causing or curing inflation. Even in a pure fiscal theory of the price level, monetary policy (setting interest rates) can control the path of expected future inflation. Thus, whether inflation continues or not also depends on how monetary policy reacts to this fiscal shock and its consequences.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Whether the Fed will do something about it is an obvious concern. The Fed\u2019s habits and new operating procedures, formed before 2019 in a Maginot Line against perpetual below-target inflation, look remarkably like the Fed of about 1971: Let inflation blow hot to march down the Phillips curve to greater employment, wait for inflation to exceed target for a while before doing anything about it, talk about \u201ctransitory\u201d and \u201csupply\u201d shocks to excuse each error. The Fed understands \u201cexpectations\u201d now, unlike in 1971, but seems to view them as a third force amenable to management by \u201cforward guidance\u201d speeches rather than formed by a hardy and skeptical experience with the Fed\u2019s concrete actions. The Fed likes to say it has \u201cthe tools\u201d to contain inflation, but never dares to say just what those tools are. &nbsp;In recent U.S. historical experience, the Fed\u2019s tool is to replay 1980: 20 percent interest rates, a bruising recession hurting the disadvantaged especially, and the medicine applied for as long as it takes. Will our Fed really do that? Will our Congress let our Fed do that? Can you deter an enemy without revealing what\u2019s in your arsenal and whether you will use it?</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>If the Fed needs to fight inflation, fiscal constraints on monetary policy will play a large and unexpected role. In 1980, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 25 percent. Today it is 100 percent, and rising swiftly. Fiscal constraints on monetary policy are four times larger today, and counting.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span> For a rise in interest rates to lower inflation, fiscal policy must tighten as well. Without that fiscal cooperation, monetary policy cannot lower inflation. There are two important channels of this interconnection.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>First, the rise in interest rates raises interest costs on the debt. The government must &nbsp;pay those higher interest costs, by raising tax revenues and cutting spending, or by credibly promising to do so in the future. At 100 percent debt to GDP, 5 percentage points higher interest rates mean an additional deficit of 5 percent of GDP or $1 trillion, for every year that high interest rates continue.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>This consideration is especially relevant if the underlying cause of the inflation is fiscal policy. If we are having inflation because people don\u2019t believe that the government can pay off the deficits it is running to send people checks, and it will not reform the looming larger entitlement promises, then people will not believe that the government can pay off an additional $1 trillion deficit to pay interest costs on the debt. &nbsp;In a fiscally driven inflation, it can happen that the central bank raises rates to fight inflation, which raises the deficit via interest costs, and thereby only makes inflation worse. This has, for example, been an analysis of several episodes in Brazil.</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Second, if monetary policy lowers inflation, then bondholders earn a real windfall. Fiscal policy must tighten to pay this windfall. &nbsp;People who bought 10-year Treasury bonds in September of 1981 got a 15.84 percent yield, as markets expected inflation to continue. From September 1981 to September 1991, the CPI grew at a 3.9 percent average rate. By this back of the envelope calculation, those bondholders got an amazing 12 percent annual real return. That return came completely and entirely courtesy of U.S. taxpayers. &nbsp;The 1986 tax reform and deregulation, which allowed the United States to grow strongly for 20 years, eventually did produce fiscal surpluses that nearly repaid U.S. federal debt. At 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio, each 5 percentage point reduction in the price level requires another 5 percent of GDP fiscal surplus.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Ask yourself, if inflation gets built into bond yields, and the Fed tries to lower inflation, will our Congress really raise tax revenues or cut spending in order to finance an unexpected (by definition) and undeserved (it will surely be argued) windfall profit to wealthy investors, foreign central bankers, and fat-cats on Wall Street? &nbsp;If it does not do so, the monetary attempt at disinflation fails.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>We state too casually that that the United States will always repay its debts, and prioritize that repayment over all else. We should not take such probity for granted. For example, in the 2021 debt ceiling discussion, it stated as fact by all concerned, from the Treasury to Congress to the White House, that hitting the debt ceiling must trigger a formal default. That is untrue. The United States could easily prioritize its tax revenues to repaying interest and principal on outstanding debt, by cutting other spending instead. Painful, yes. Impossible, no. That the U.S. contingency plan for a binding debt ceiling is formal default tells you that the spirit of Alexander Hamilton, preaching the sanctity of debt repayment to build reputation so we can borrow in the future, is truly dead. And with inflation, we are not even talking about formal default. The question is, will the United States undertake a sharp fiscal austerity to support monetary policy in the fight against inflation, by paying higher interest costs on the debt and by repaying bondholders in more valuable money? &nbsp;Or will the government just repay as promised, but in dollars that are worth more than expected? If the government does the latter, monetary policy fails.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>There is a third troublesome requirement for higher nominal interest rates to produce lower inflation. One needs an economic model in which this is true, that model needs to be correct, and its preconditions need to be met. &nbsp;It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, because in the long run, when real interest rates settle down, higher nominal interest rates must come with higher, not lower inflation. So you need an understanding of how and when things work the other direction in the short run.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>In standard new-Keynesian models, used by all central banks, for example, higher interest rates only produce lower inflation if the higher interest rate is unexpected\u2014that is, a \u201cshock\u201d to the economy\u2014and if there is a sharp contemporaneous fiscal contraction, for the above reasons. &nbsp; A widely expected rise in nominal interest rates raises inflation. &nbsp;A rise in interest rates without the corresponding ``austerity\u2019\u2019 raises inflation. &nbsp;Both preconditions are questionable today.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>More complex ingredients, such as long-term debt or financial frictions, can allow a higher nominal rate to temporarily lower inflation. But reliance on more complex ingredients and frictions is also dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Future</b></p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>The future is not hopeless. Inflation control simply requires our government, including the central bank, to understand classic lessons of history. Forestalling inflation is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Stabilizing inflation once it gets out of control is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Expectations are \u201canchored\u201d if people believe such policy is in place, and politicians and Fed officials are ready to act if needed.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>I add \u201cmicro-economic,\u201d as it is perhaps the most frequently overlooked adjective. Fiscal surpluses do not result from sharply higher tax rates, especially of a tax system so riven with economic distortions as ours. Fiscal surpluses can come from spending restraint, but that too is difficult. The best road to fiscal surpluses is strong economic growth, which increases the tax base and lowers the need for social spending. &nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>In the conundrum between taxes and spending, there is a way out: raise long-term economic growth. And there is only one way to do that: to increase the supply-side capacity of the economy. That is, however, just as politically controversial as the first two options. Most of the job is to get out of the way. Most economic regulation is designed to transfer incomes, to protect various interests, or to push on the scales of bilateral negotiation, to undo the harsh siren of economic incentives, in a way that stifles economic growth. Many interests hate pro-growth legislation and regulation just as much as they hate taxes and spending cuts. The r&lt;g crowd has a point, but increasing g is the answer.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Much of the \u201csupply shocks\u201d of 2021 come down to the \u201cgreat resignation\u201d\u2014that is, &nbsp;the puzzling decline in labor force participation despite a labor shortage. The work disincentives of social programs\u2014paying people not to work, bluntly\u2014are laid bare.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>All successful inflation stabilizations have combined monetary, fiscal, and micro-economic reforms. I emphasize reforms. In most cases the tax system is reformed to provide more revenue with less distortion. The structure of spending programs is reformed to help people in need more efficiently without work disincentives. Regulations are reformed, though they hurt the profits of incumbents, to increase entry, competition and innovation. &nbsp;The policy regime is changed, durably. Reversible decisions and pie-crust promises do not do much to change the present value of surpluses, to raise the government\u2019s ability to pledge a long stream of surpluses to support debt.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>1980 did not succeed in the United States from monetary toughness only. &nbsp;1980 included supply-side deregulation, and was quickly followed by the 1982 and 1986 tax reforms. The economy took off, so by the late 1990s economists were seriously writing papers about what to do when the federal debt had all been repaid. Many monetary stabilizations have been tried without fiscal and microeconomic reform. They typically fail after a year or two. The history of Latin America is littered with them (Kehoe and Nicolini 2021). &nbsp;The high interest rates of the early 1980s likely represented a fear that the United States would suffer the same fate. The 1970s were not just a failure of monetary policy. The deficits of the great society and Vietnam War contributed, while the supply \u201cshocks\u201d and productivity slowdown did their part.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>These points are especially important if the 2021 inflation turns in to a sustained 2020s inflation, as the 1971 inflation turned in to a sustained 1970s inflation. For this time, the roots of inflation will most likely be fiscal, a broad change of view that our government really will not eventually reform and repay its debt. The only fundamental answer to that question will be, to reform and set in place a durable structure that will repay debt. Monetary machination will be pointless.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>A small bout of inflation may be useful to our body politic.

A small bout of inflation may reteach the same classes that supply matters, incentives matter, and sand in the gears matter. &nbsp;The 1980s reforms only happened because the 1970s were so painful. &nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>In the meantime, however, there is one technical thing the Fed and Treasury can do to forestall a larger crisis: borrow long. &nbsp;Interest costs feed into the budget as debt rolls over. U.S. debt is shockingly short maturity, rolled over on average about every two years. If the United States borrows long-term, then higher interest rates do not raise interest costs on existing debt at all. Shifting to long-term debt would remove one of the main fiscal constraints on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has not helped this fiscal constraint, by transforming a fifth of the federal debt to overnight, floating-rate debt. The 30-year Treasury rate is, as I write 2 percent, about negative 1 percent in real terms. Okay, the 1-year rate is 0.13 percent. As long as this lasts, the government seems to pay lower interest costs. &nbsp;But a 1.87 percent insurance premium to wipe out the danger of a sovereign debt crisis and to buy huge fiscal space to fight inflation seems like a pretty cheap insurance policy. The window of opportunity will not last long, however, as interest rates are already creeping up.&nbsp;</p><p><b>References</b></p><p>Cochrane, J. H.

Cochrane From its inflection point in February 2021 to November 2021, the CPI rose 6 percent (278.88/263.161), an 8 percent annualized rate. \u00a0Why?\u00a0Starting in March 2020, in response to the disruptions of Covid-19, the U.S. government created about $3 trillion of new bank reserves, equivalent to cash, and sent checks to people and businesses. (Mechanically, the Treasury issued $3 trillion of new debt, which the Fed quickly bought in return for $3 trillion of new reserves. The Treasury sent out checks, transferring the reserves to people\u2019s banks. See Table 1.) \u00a0The Treasury then borrowed another $2 trillion or so, and sent more checks. Overall federal debt rose nearly 30 percent. Is it at all a surprise that a year later inflation breaks out? \u00a0It is hard to ask for a clearer demonstration of fiscal inflation, an immense fiscal helicopter drop, exhibit A for the fiscal theory of the price level (Cochrane 2022a, 2022b). \u00a0What Dropped from the Helicopter?\u00a0From December 2019 to September 2021, the M2 money stock also increased by $5.6 trillion. \u00a0This looks like a monetary, not a fiscal intervention, Milton Friedman\u2019s (1969) classic tale that if you want inflation, drop money from helicopters. But is it monetary or fiscal policy? Ask yourself: Suppose the expansion of M2 had been entirely financed by purchasing Treasury securities. Imagine Treasury debt had declined $5 trillion while M2 and reserves rose $5 trillion. Imagine that there had been no deficit at all, or even a surplus during this period. The monetary theory of inflation, MV=PY, states that we would see the same inflation. Really?  Similarly, ask yourself: Suppose that the Federal Reserve had refused to go along. Suppose that the Treasury had sent people Treasury bills directly, accounts at Treasury.gov, along with directions how to sell them if people wished to do so. Better, suppose that the Treasury had created new mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and sent people mutual fund shares. (I write mutual fund as money market funds are counted in M2.) The monetary theory of inflation says again that this would have had no effect. These would be a debt issue, causing no inflation, not a monetary expansion. Really?\u00a0 Clearly, overall debt matters, not the split of government debt between interest-paying reserves or monetary base and Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve itself is nothing more than an immense money-market fund, offering shares that are pegged at $1 each, pay interest, and are backed by a portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. (Plus, an army of regulators and a huge staff of economists who are supposed to help forecast inflation.)\u00a0 Milton Friedman\u2019s (1969) helicopter drop is a powerful parable. But a helicopter drop is a fiscal policy, not a monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve may not legally drop money from helicopters; it may not write checks to voters. The Fed may even less vacuum up money; it may not tax people. Helicopter drops and money vacuums are fiscal operations. The Fed may only lend money, or buy and sell assets. To accomplish a helicopter drop in the United States, the Treasury must issue debt, the Fed must buy it with newly printed money, and then the Treasury must drop that money from helicopters, writing it down as a transfer payment. And that is pretty much exactly what happened.\u00a0 Ask yourself: If, as Friedman\u2019s helicopter is dropping $1,000 on each household, the Fed sends burglars who remove $1,000 of Treasury securities from the same households, would we still see inflation? That\u2019s monetary policy. If Friedman\u2019s helicopter were followed by the Treasury secretary with a bullhorn, shouting \u201cEnjoy your $1,000 in helicopter money. Taxes are going up $1,000 tomorrow,\u201d would we still see inflation?\u00a0 Friedman\u2019s helicopters are not a monetary change, a substitution of money for debt, an increase in the liquidity of a given set of household assets. They are a \u201cwealth effect\u201d of government debt. Dropping debt from helicopters is a brilliant psychological device for convincing people that the government debt raining down on them will not be repaid by future taxes or spending restraint. It will be left outstanding, so they had better spend it now.\u00a0Indeed, we just witnessed a \u201chelicopter drop.\u201d But a helicopter drop is fiscal policy.\u00a0 Why did fiscal inflation not happen sooner? The government has been borrowing money like the proverbial drunken sailor, for decades. The Fed has been buying Treasury securities and turning the debt into reserves for a decade. Why now? Inflation comes when government debt increases, relative to people\u2019s expectations of what the government will repay. If the Treasury borrows, but everyone understands it will later raise tax revenues or cut spending to repay the debt, that debt does not cause inflation. It is a good investment, and people are happy to hold on to it. If the Fed prints up a lot of money, buys Treasury debt, and the Treasury hands out the money, as happened, but everyone understands the Treasury will pay back the debt with future surpluses, the extra money causes no inflation. The Fed can always soak up the money by selling its Treasury securities, and the Treasury repays those securities with surpluses (i.e., taxes less spending).\u00a0 The 2020\u20132021 borrowing and money episode was distinctive because, evidently, it came without a corresponding increase in expectations that the government would, someday, raise surpluses by $5 trillion in present value to repay the debt. \u00a0Looking in to people\u2019s heads is hard, but why? We can at least find some plausible speculations.\u00a0One may look to politicians\u2019 statements. Even in the Obama-era \u201cstimulus\u201d spending, the administration emphasized promises of eventual debt reduction. One may chuckle and sneer at promises to repay debts decades after an administration leaves office, but at least they went through the motions to make that promise! Nobody went through any motions about long-run fiscal planning, long-run deficit reduction, and entitlement and tax reform, in 2020\u20132021. \u00a0It was the era of modern monetary theory (MMT), of costless \u201cfiscal expansion\u201d made possible, or so it was claimed, by the manna-from-heaven that interest rates would stay low forever.\u00a0 The manner of fiscal expansion matters too. When the Treasury borrows in the usual manner, it borrows from established long-term investors, who view Treasury debt as debt that will be repaid and not defaulted or inflated. They view it as a savings or investment vehicle, not as cash to be spent. They save, or invest, based on long and so-far mostly successful experience. This time, following canary-in-the-coal mine disruptions in Treasury markets during March 2020, the Federal Reserve immediately bought new Treasury debt with newly created money, before it even touched these investor\u2019s portfolios. The effect of the operation was to print new money and send people checks, so the debt issue is now held as bank deposits flowing into reserves, rather than as Treasury securities. People holding this new money are likely to spend it rather than regard it as a long-term investment. \u00a0In our simplest economic models, it does not matter who holds the debt. But in just a little more nuanced view, who holds the debt matters.\u00a0 In our simplest economic models, interest-paying reserves and Treasuries are equivalent securities. But people likely do see a difference between reserves and short-run Treasuries. Treasuries may well carry a reputation that they will be repaid, while people assume reserves will not be repaid by larger surpluses. Then issuing lots of reserves rather than Treasuries is inflationary, but not because the reserves are ``money,\u2019\u2019 but rather because they convey a different set of fiscal expectations, just as dropping money or debt from helicopters sends a different signal about repayment than issuing debt at a Treasury auction.Most of the previous operations financed government spending or government worker salaries, counting on higher incomes to slowly filter through the economy. This one sent checks directly to people. \u00a0 Finally, this fiscal stimulus was enormous, and carried out on a deep misdiagnosis of the state of the economy. Even in simplistic hydraulic Keynesian terms, $5 trillion times any multiplier is much larger than any plausible GDP gap. And the Covid recession was not due to a demand deficiency in the first place. A pandemic is, to the economy, like a huge snowstorm. Sending people money will not get them to go out to closed bars, restaurants, airlines, and businesses.\u00a0\u201cStimulus,\u201d \u201caccommodation,\u201d \u201ceasing\u201d was the point. This method finally worked, where previous stimulus efforts failed. One can see several suggestive differences, which amount to important economic lessons. What about \u201csupply shocks?\u201d What about a shift of demand from services to durables? Much analysis misses the difference between relative prices and inflation, in which all prices and wages rise together. A supply shock makes one good more expensive than others. Only demand makes all goods rise together. There wouldn\u2019t be \u201csupply chain\u201d problems if people were not trying to buy things like mad! A shift in demand from services to durables can make durable prices go up. But it would make services prices go down. And let us not even go down the ridiculous path of blaming inflation on a sudden contagious outbreak of \u201cgreed\u201d and \u201ccollusion\u201d by businesses from oil companies to turkey farmers, needing the administration to send the FTC out to investigate.\u00a0 It is telling that inflation was a complete surprise to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve\u2019s job is supposed to be to monitor the supply capacity of the economy and to make sure demand does not outstrip it. \u00a0The Fed failed twice. First, the economy did not need demand-side stimulus. Insurance was wise, and forestalling a financial crisis was necessary. But sending money to every citizen to stoke demand was not. Second, the Fed being surprised by supply shocks is as excusable as the Army losing a battle because its leaders are surprised that the enemy might attack. \u00a0As we see by the outcome, the Fed\u2019s understanding of supply, largely based on statistical analysis of labor markets, is rudimentary.\u00a0\u00a0 WilI Inflation Continue?\u00a0 If the government borrows or prints $5 trillion, with no change in its plan to repay debt, on top of $17 trillion outstanding debt, then the price level will rise a cumulative 30 percent, so that the $22 trillion of debt is worth in real terms what the $17 trillion was before. In essence, absent a credible increase in future surpluses, the deficit is financed by defaulting on $5 trillion of outstanding debt, via inflation. By this calculation, the 6 percent or so cumulative inflation we have seen so far leaves a way to go. \u00a0But people may think some of the debt will be repaid. If they think half will eventually be repaid, then the price level need only rise 15 percent overall.\u00a0 But then it stops. A one-time unbacked debt increase leads to a one-time price-level increase, not continuing inflation. Whether inflation continues or not depends on future \u00a0monetary policy, future fiscal policy, and whether people change their minds about overall debt repayment. \u00a0 Fiscal policy may not be done with us yet. If unbacked fiscal expansions continue\u2014that is, borrowing when people do not expect additional repayment\u2014then additional bouts of fiscal inflation will occur. Untold trillions of spending, including new entitlements, with no realistic hope of raising tax revenues commensurately to cover them are certainly high on the Biden administration\u2019s agenda. (Higher tax rates do not necessarily mean higher revenues, if economic growth falters; and even so the proposed taxes do not cover the proposed spending increases even with static scoring.) The mentality that borrowed money need never be repaid, because the MMT fairy or r<g magic makes debt free, remains strong in Washington. \u00a0But the failure of the so-called \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan may augur well for budget seriousness and a limit to ill-constructed social policies with strong supply disincentives.\u00a0 The most troublesome question remains: Do people, having decided that at least some of our government\u2019s new debt will not be repaid, so they should spend it now and inflate it away, now think that the government is less likely to repay its existing debts, or less likely to repay future borrowing? If so, even more inflation can break out, seemingly (as always) out of nowhere.\u00a0Fiscal Constraints on Monetary Policy\u00a0 Fiscal and monetary policies are always intertwined in causing or curing inflation. Even in a pure fiscal theory of the price level, monetary policy (setting interest rates) can control the path of expected future inflation. Thus, whether inflation continues or not also depends on how monetary policy reacts to this fiscal shock and its consequences.\u00a0 Whether the Fed will do something about it is an obvious concern. The Fed\u2019s habits and new operating procedures, formed before 2019 in a Maginot Line against perpetual below-target inflation, look remarkably like the Fed of about 1971: Let inflation blow hot to march down the Phillips curve to greater employment, wait for inflation to exceed target for a while before doing anything about it, talk about \u201ctransitory\u201d and \u201csupply\u201d shocks to excuse each error. The Fed understands \u201cexpectations\u201d now, unlike in 1971, but seems to view them as a third force amenable to management by \u201cforward guidance\u201d speeches rather than formed by a hardy and skeptical experience with the Fed\u2019s concrete actions. The Fed likes to say it has \u201cthe tools\u201d to contain inflation, but never dares to say just what those tools are. \u00a0In recent U.S. historical experience, the Fed\u2019s tool is to replay 1980: 20 percent interest rates, a bruising recession hurting the disadvantaged especially, and the medicine applied for as long as it takes. Will our Fed really do that? Will our Congress let our Fed do that? Can you deter an enemy without revealing what\u2019s in your arsenal and whether you will use it? If the Fed needs to fight inflation, fiscal constraints on monetary policy will play a large and unexpected role. In 1980, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 25 percent. Today it is 100 percent, and rising swiftly. Fiscal constraints on monetary policy are four times larger today, and counting.\u00a0  For a rise in interest rates to lower inflation, fiscal policy must tighten as well. Without that fiscal cooperation, monetary policy cannot lower inflation. There are two important channels of this interconnection.\u00a0 First, the rise in interest rates raises interest costs on the debt. The government must \u00a0pay those higher interest costs, by raising tax revenues and cutting spending, or by credibly promising to do so in the future. At 100 percent debt to GDP, 5 percentage points higher interest rates mean an additional deficit of 5 percent of GDP or $1 trillion, for every year that high interest rates continue.\u00a0 This consideration is especially relevant if the underlying cause of the inflation is fiscal policy. If we are having inflation because people don\u2019t believe that the government can pay off the deficits it is running to send people checks, and it will not reform the looming larger entitlement promises, then people will not believe that the government can pay off an additional $1 trillion deficit to pay interest costs on the debt. \u00a0In a fiscally driven inflation, it can happen that the central bank raises rates to fight inflation, which raises the deficit via interest costs, and thereby only makes inflation worse. This has, for example, been an analysis of several episodes in Brazil. Second, if monetary policy lowers inflation, then bondholders earn a real windfall. Fiscal policy must tighten to pay this windfall. \u00a0People who bought 10-year Treasury bonds in September of 1981 got a 15.84 percent yield, as markets expected inflation to continue. From September 1981 to September 1991, the CPI grew at a 3.9 percent average rate. By this back of the envelope calculation, those bondholders got an amazing 12 percent annual real return. That return came completely and entirely courtesy of U.S. taxpayers. \u00a0The 1986 tax reform and deregulation, which allowed the United States to grow strongly for 20 years, eventually did produce fiscal surpluses that nearly repaid U.S. federal debt. At 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio, each 5 percentage point reduction in the price level requires another 5 percent of GDP fiscal surplus.\u00a0 Ask yourself, if inflation gets built into bond yields, and the Fed tries to lower inflation, will our Congress really raise tax revenues or cut spending in order to finance an unexpected (by definition) and undeserved (it will surely be argued) windfall profit to wealthy investors, foreign central bankers, and fat-cats on Wall Street? \u00a0If it does not do so, the monetary attempt at disinflation fails.\u00a0 We state too casually that that the United States will always repay its debts, and prioritize that repayment over all else. We should not take such probity for granted. For example, in the 2021 debt ceiling discussion, it stated as fact by all concerned, from the Treasury to Congress to the White House, that hitting the debt ceiling must trigger a formal default. That is untrue. The United States could easily prioritize its tax revenues to repaying interest and principal on outstanding debt, by cutting other spending instead. Painful, yes. Impossible, no. That the U.S. contingency plan for a binding debt ceiling is formal default tells you that the spirit of Alexander Hamilton, preaching the sanctity of debt repayment to build reputation so we can borrow in the future, is truly dead. And with inflation, we are not even talking about formal default. The question is, will the United States undertake a sharp fiscal austerity to support monetary policy in the fight against inflation, by paying higher interest costs on the debt and by repaying bondholders in more valuable money? \u00a0Or will the government just repay as promised, but in dollars that are worth more than expected? If the government does the latter, monetary policy fails.\u00a0 There is a third troublesome requirement for higher nominal interest rates to produce lower inflation. One needs an economic model in which this is true, that model needs to be correct, and its preconditions need to be met. \u00a0It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, because in the long run, when real interest rates settle down, higher nominal interest rates must come with higher, not lower inflation. So you need an understanding of how and when things work the other direction in the short run.\u00a0 In standard new-Keynesian models, used by all central banks, for example, higher interest rates only produce lower inflation if the higher interest rate is unexpected\u2014that is, a \u201cshock\u201d to the economy\u2014and if there is a sharp contemporaneous fiscal contraction, for the above reasons. \u00a0 A widely expected rise in nominal interest rates raises inflation. \u00a0A rise in interest rates without the corresponding ``austerity\u2019\u2019 raises inflation. \u00a0Both preconditions are questionable today. More complex ingredients, such as long-term debt or financial frictions, can allow a higher nominal rate to temporarily lower inflation. But reliance on more complex ingredients and frictions is also dangerous.\u00a0The Future The future is not hopeless. Inflation control simply requires our government, including the central bank, to understand classic lessons of history. Forestalling inflation is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Stabilizing inflation once it gets out of control is a joint task of fiscal, monetary, and micro-economic policy. Expectations are \u201canchored\u201d if people believe such policy is in place, and politicians and Fed officials are ready to act if needed.\u00a0 I add \u201cmicro-economic,\u201d as it is perhaps the most frequently overlooked adjective. Fiscal surpluses do not result from sharply higher tax rates, especially of a tax system so riven with economic distortions as ours. Fiscal surpluses can come from spending restraint, but that too is difficult. The best road to fiscal surpluses is strong economic growth, which increases the tax base and lowers the need for social spending. \u00a0 In the conundrum between taxes and spending, there is a way out: raise long-term economic growth. And there is only one way to do that: to increase the supply-side capacity of the economy. That is, however, just as politically controversial as the first two options. Most of the job is to get out of the way. Most economic regulation is designed to transfer incomes, to protect various interests, or to push on the scales of bilateral negotiation, to undo the harsh siren of economic incentives, in a way that stifles economic growth. Many interests hate pro-growth legislation and regulation just as much as they hate taxes and spending cuts. The r<g crowd has a point, but increasing g is the answer.\u00a0 Much of the \u201csupply shocks\u201d of 2021 come down to the \u201cgreat resignation\u201d\u2014that is, \u00a0the puzzling decline in labor force participation despite a labor shortage. The work disincentives of social programs\u2014paying people not to work, bluntly\u2014are laid bare.\u00a0 All successful inflation stabilizations have combined monetary, fiscal, and micro-economic reforms. I emphasize reforms. In most cases the tax system is reformed to provide more revenue with less distortion. The structure of spending programs is reformed to help people in need more efficiently without work disincentives. Regulations are reformed, though they hurt the profits of incumbents, to increase entry, competition and innovation. \u00a0The policy regime is changed, durably. Reversible decisions and pie-crust promises do not do much to change the present value of surpluses, to raise the government\u2019s ability to pledge a long stream of surpluses to support debt.\u00a0 1980 did not succeed in the United States from monetary toughness only. \u00a01980 included supply-side deregulation, and was quickly followed by the 1982 and 1986 tax reforms. The economy took off, so by the late 1990s economists were seriously writing papers about what to do when the federal debt had all been repaid. Many monetary stabilizations have been tried without fiscal and microeconomic reform. They typically fail after a year or two. The history of Latin America is littered with them (Kehoe and Nicolini 2021). \u00a0The high interest rates of the early 1980s likely represented a fear that the United States would suffer the same fate. The 1970s were not just a failure of monetary policy. The deficits of the great society and Vietnam War contributed, while the supply \u201cshocks\u201d and productivity slowdown did their part.\u00a0 These points are especially important if the 2021 inflation turns in to a sustained 2020s inflation, as the 1971 inflation turned in to a sustained 1970s inflation. For this time, the roots of inflation will most likely be fiscal, a broad change of view that our government really will not eventually reform and repay its debt. The only fundamental answer to that question will be, to reform and set in place a durable structure that will repay debt. Monetary machination will be pointless.\u00a0 A small bout of inflation may be useful to our body politic. Inflation is where dreams of costless fiscal expansion, flooding the country with borrowed money to address every perceived problem, hit a hard brick wall of reality. \u00a0A small bout of inflation and debt problems may reteach our politicians, officials, and commentariat the classic lessons that \u00a0there are fiscal limits, fiscal and monetary policy are intertwined, and that a country with solid long-term institutions can borrow, but a country without them is in trouble, and one must allow the golden goose to thrive if one wants to tax her eggs. A small bout of inflation may reteach the same classes that supply matters, incentives matter, and sand in the gears matter. \u00a0The 1980s reforms only happened because the 1970s were so painful. \u00a0 In the meantime, however, there is one technical thing the Fed and Treasury can do to forestall a larger crisis: borrow long. \u00a0Interest costs feed into the budget as debt rolls over. U.S. debt is shockingly short maturity, rolled over on average about every two years. If the United States borrows long-term, then higher interest rates do not raise interest costs on existing debt at all. Shifting to long-term debt would remove one of the main fiscal constraints on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has not helped this fiscal constraint, by transforming a fifth of the federal debt to overnight, floating-rate debt. The 30-year Treasury rate is, as I write 2 percent, about negative 1 percent in real terms. Okay, the 1-year rate is 0.13 percent. As long as this lasts, the government seems to pay lower interest costs. \u00a0But a 1.87 percent insurance premium to wipe out the danger of a sovereign debt crisis and to buy huge fiscal space to fight inflation seems like a pretty cheap insurance policy. The window of opportunity will not last long, however, as interest rates are already creeping up.\u00a0ReferencesCochrane, J. H.

Total debt (public and private) grew at 10.5% y/y in fourth quarter of 2007 and then stayed between 2% and 4% for all of Obama's administration (2008-2016).This comment has been removed by the author.That's what the government is already doing: issuing perpetuities. Since, as you said in your post, nobody is expecting the government paying back the debt ever, it is issuing perpetuities.True, the perpetuities the government is issuing now include a \"feature\": they have \"liquidity windows\" on which the government will attempt, on a best effort basis, to find other investors that provide the liquidity the bonds you hold today. Since the risk is all on the hands of the present investors (they have no collateral to claim and no assets will be seized if the government fails to find new suckers in those liquidity windows) this feature is, mostly, irrelevant and does not make a big difference with actual perpetuities.El Emperador,True perpetuities have no roll over or redemption date.The petpetuities that the central bank is issuing are the FRN's that they use to purchase the Treasury bonds.I think that if the US tries to place perpetuities right now it would fail. No one will take that duration risk in a new thin market (well maybe Goldman would stuff it into their customer's portfolios). It may be seen as  a sign that an adult is in charge at Treasury, or seen as a sign that the Government is finally seeing the problems above and preparing for a crisis.  \"JC - The 1980s reforms only happened because the 1970s were so painful.\"The other \"reform\" that happened in the 1990's was that Bob Rubin and Larry Summers while at the Treasury decided to shorten the term structure of the Federal debt to help reduce interest expenditures and bring federal expenditures (including interest payments) in line with federal receipts.\"JC - In the meantime, however, there is one technical thing the Fed and Treasury can do to forestall a larger crisis: borrow long.\"So the plan is for the Treasury to borrow long until the necessary \"reforms\" are enacted by a future Congress and Treasury and one of those \"reforms\" is for a future Treasury to reduce the term structure of the federal debt?\"The 1986 tax reform and deregulation, which allowed the United States to grow strongly for 20 years, eventually did produce fiscal surpluses that nearly repaid U.S. federal debt.\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986\"The act lowered federal income tax rates, decreasing the number of tax brackets and reducing the top tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent.\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1993\"The act increased the top federal income tax rate from 31% to 39.6%, increased the corporate income tax rate, raised fuel taxes, and raised various other taxes.\"If by eventually, you mean that the top marginal tax rate was \"eventually\" raised from 28% up to 39.6%, after being lowered from 50% to 28%, then yes the 1986 tax reform \"led\" to eventual surpluses.Much of the \u201csupply shocks\u201d of 2021 come down to the \u201cgreat resignation\u201d\u2014that is,  the puzzling decline in labor force participation despite a labor shortage. The work disincentives of social programs\u2014paying people not to work, bluntly\u2014are laid bare.Well...The CIVRATE has dropped for a few reasons;1. The pandemic accelerated retirement for a large chunk of baby boomers. 2. Women leaving the workforce to take care of children because schools and daycares being unavailable. Women still have the highest demand for temporal flexibility. 3. Fear of returning to work for fear of getting infected. Not an unreasonable fear. Guilting and shaming people back to work is rarely useful.4. A game of chicken between employers and employees. The demand for temporal flexibility is increasing amongst both genders. Non-pecuniary benefits are becoming more important. Who will flinch first? The fiscal helicopter drops weren't just for saving consumption. It was used to pay rent and also to pay down debt. As the blizzard is largely over, yes, those with cash in hand need an asbestos wallet so it doesn't burn a hole in their pockets. But the labor shortages are creating cost push inflation on top of demand pull. But let's not lay the blame for the dysfunctional labor market at the feet of the fiscal side for plugging a huge hole due to lockdowns. \"From December 2019 to September 2021, the M2 money stock also increased by $5.6 trillion.  This looks like a monetary, not a fiscal intervention, Milton Friedman\u2019s (1969) classic tale that if you want inflation, drop money from helicopters. But is it monetary or fiscal policy? Ask yourself: Suppose the expansion of M2 had been entirely financed by purchasing Treasury securities. Imagine Treasury debt had declined $5 trillion while M2 and reserves rose $5 trillion. Imagine that there had been no deficit at all, or even a surplus during this period. The monetary theory of inflation, MV=PY, states that we would see the same inflation. Really?  Similarly, ask yourself: Suppose that the Federal Reserve had refused to go along. Suppose that the Treasury had sent people Treasury bills directly, accounts at Treasury.gov, along with directions how to sell them if people wished to do so. Better, suppose that the Treasury had created new mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and sent people mutual fund shares. (I write mutual fund as money market funds are counted in M2.) The monetary theory of inflation says again that this would have had no effect. These would be a debt issue, causing no inflation, not a monetary expansion. Really?\"I feel like this is a really important paragraph of the article. All else equal, I would prefer more in depth discussion on how the fiscal theory and monetary theory differ. The \"Really?\"s in it make me a bit suspicious that I am not getting the full story. I worry that someone who believes the monetary theory might argue that this does not represent their views. The truth is that borrowing activities in general have inflationary effects. In the past when most borrowings are in the form of bank loans, monetary aggregates are a good proxy of borrowing activities (since loans create deposits which go into M2). Nowadays that bonds player a much greater role, bond issuances (including by the government which is fiscal policy) are also inflationary, even when they just involve transfer of money between non-bank sectors (and hence do not affect M2). For example, if I have $100 deposit at a bank. I borrow $100 from the bank, and use it to buy a sandwich from a shop, who deposits the $100 at the same bank. So sandwich price goes up, and M2 goes up by $100.Now if I buy $100 of bills issued by the government, who pays $100 to the sandwich shop, and the shop then deposits the money at the same bank. So sandwich price goes up while total deposits (M2) say the same.\"dollars that are worth more than expected\" -> \"dollars that are worth less than expected\"?For once that's not a typo. In 1980, 10 year rates rose to 15%, as people expected inflation to stay that high. When inflation fell to 3%, the bondholders got paid back in dollars worth more than they had expected. I could have phrased that more clearly. You had me at... \"Ask yourself: If, as Friedman\u2019s helicopter is dropping $1,000 on each household, the Fed sends burglars who remove $1,000 of Treasury securities from the same household\". Pure gold (no pun intended).as I have kids I find this immensely depressing! I see people thinking this is the Best of Times...like Wall Street bankers, bitcoiners, Billionaires, Democrats....This is WORST OF TIMES! Anyone thinking person knows this will end REALLY REALLY BADMMT stand for Modern Monetary Theory?  I thought it stood for Magical Monetary Theory.  My mistake, I guess.Or Nagical Money Tree. It's a structural shift away from Monetary policy to the Fiscal side. Problem is that assuming taxes will take out excess supply and then redistribute all over again? I have doubts about that mechanism but maybe I got it wrong. There will still be tax avoidance and evasion. At least with NY's OMO office, supply can be adjusted with mechanisms that generally \"work.\" The one upside to at least trying out MMT is that if it doesn't work, the stake can be put in the vampire relatively easily. The effectiveness lag of Fiscal is immediate compared to that of the Fed. But the Fed wins on the implementation side. Raising taxes or reducing spending strikes me as being two sides of the same coin. Either way, somebody's ox is going to get gored. More importantly, politicians are loath to take anything away from their voters that might affect their reelection chances. While many voices will decry inflation, in all likelihood, politicians will do what they have always done - nothing - pass the buck (literally) and hope that we can somehow inflate our way out of this problem. And, if the GOP is successful in retaking Congress and the White House, it seems unlikely that will do anything more than keep spending.As a New Year's sentiment let me say how much I have enjoyed these blogs by John Cochrane over the years.As a layman, I find myself swayed but not convinced by the last arguments I read by any prominent macroeconomist.I wish you guys would come up with a common perspective.John reminds me of a gentlemen I met in the grocery store.Each day he would ask the cashier in the produce section if they have fresh pomegranates.  The cashier would kindly respond to the gentleman that they have bottled pomegranate juice (POM Wonderful or some other variety) but do not carry fresh pomegranates.One day the same gentleman asks the same question again.  To my surprise the cashier points to a section of the produce department and indicates that yes they now carry fresh pomegranates.  The gentleman walks back to that section, looks over the selection of pomegranates and then walks away.My curiousity peaked, I walk over to the gentleman and ask him why he didn't purchase any.  He replies that he doesn't care for pomegranates at all.Let's do a test. (1) Inflation was rising in 1965-66, and the Fed tightened.  Meanwhile, the budget deficit got larger from LBJ guns-and-butter budget.  Inflation fell.    Sounds like Fed tightening mattered, not the deficit.LBJ literally slammed Fed Chair Martin against the wall at his ranch.  Talk about fiscal dominance!  Martin eased, and inflation rose. (2)  Reagan cut taxes and increased defense spending, and the deficit surged.   Meanwhile, Volcker tightened to the max, and we had a recession and inflation plunged.   Fed tightening mattered.   The deficit did not. (3) We had a gigantic deficit in 2009 with no promise to pay it off.  That is how we got TEA Party protests.   But inflation turned in deflation.   A negative shock to aggregate demand could be the explanation.  Fiscal theory doesn't cut it.  FTPL seems to depend on expectations of future austerity.   But we have no way to measure such expectations.  It becomes a non-testable conjecture. The confusion of monetary and fiscal policies seem to happen when the overnight rate is zero, which blurs the distinction between money and Tbills.  I am being pedantic, but here goes.You talk about a five percent increase in interest rates.Are you really thinking about a five percentage point rise in interest rates? Those two sentences are not the same thing.  You are correct, and I should write percentage points. That's accuracy not pedantry! Your support for accuracy is commendable.  ThanksThe economy runs on energy not the various intermediate goods.  Debt is a IOU on future energy. It would appear that continued growth in future energy is questionable.  Some seem to be saying that the off book government debt will also be a problem.  The Fed is using Ducktape to hold things together in the face of energy depletion.  Growth proponents need an appendix to detail where the required resources will come from.  Two other notes re perpetuities: if the Treasury were to issue perpetuities it would have to come up with an iron-clad guarantee that it would not borrow more than say x % of total debt (50%?) in short term instruments ever again, else what would be the point (aside for paradoxically enabling even more reckless borrowing). TY will also  have to swap in or retire existing short term debt subject to this rule as well to get to this operating point. A proposal would have to have teeth too, though, as everyone would know that when the next Build Back Better is proposed and congress starts looking in the couch cushions for coins to pretend to cover spending, they will borrow again at the front of the curve to shave a couple of basis points on the projected interest.As to credibility- Yellen would have been the ideal candidate to show a TY sec with spine managing the term structure of the GOVT debt, but I must admit I am very disappointed in Yellen so far: seems she not only drinks the Kool-Aid, she is now pouring it.Second, can you issue perpetuities when interest rates are so incredibly low? Say they are issued at 2.5% coupon, it is definitely in the realm of possibility to have yields go to 5%, in which case there will be a massive capital loss for holders. And who will scoop up the perpetuities -- as it is govt debt, most likely it will be  sucked in as a 'safe asset' in insurance companies and retirement portfolios. Basel will probably encourage it, too.Does anyone have a link that explains this in more detail? I vaguely remember this from my economics courses, but I couldn't find anything after more than an hour of Googling. Thanks!In standard new-Keynesian models, used by all central banks, for example, higher interest rates only produce lower inflation if the higher interest rate is unexpected\u2014that is, a \u201cshock\u201d to the economy . . .A widely expected rise in nominal interest rates raises inflation.\" An earlier blog post explains this, https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2021/09/inflation-in-shadow-of-debt.htmlThis comment has been removed by the author.Thank you! However, I believe that post explains why the interest rate increase must be accompanied by fiscal tightening. I'm trying to understand why the interest rate increase must be unexpected rather than widely expected. Does anyone have a link? Thank you very much!An expected interest rate increase is already priced in to bonds. And an expected fiscal tightening can't unexpectedly devalue bonds. \"If the government borrows or prints $5 trillion, with no change in its plan to repay debt, on top of $17 trillion outstanding debt, then the price level will rise a cumulative 30 percent, so that the $22 trillion of debt is worth in real terms what the $17 trillion was before. In essence, absent a credible increase in future surpluses, the deficit is financed by defaulting on $5 trillion of outstanding debt, via inflation.\"It seems that recent reality has had the trillions going directly into the price levels.The share price levels of the FAANG market capitalization increases.Apple is now a $3 trillion company, and there are a few other $ trillion companies.The gov't spends $5 trillion, paying off donors and \"doing good\", and the 5 largest companies all increase their market cap by $1 trillion.  This looks like what has been happening for the last decade, with the new Biden choices to reduce energy supply (higher prices! feeding thru all prices) and enforce vax mandates to fire millions of workers and to supply helicopter money to help folks have more to spend.If the Treasury started trading out its short term debt for long term debt, wouldn\u2019t that immediately spook markets and signal that the Treasury doesn\u2019t think it can repay its debts?  I\u2019m just wondering whether the chosen maturity of Treasury debt has effects on market expectations and beliefs.This comment has been removed by the author.One of my favourite blofComments are welcome.

The federal government has found itself unable to build simple infrastructure or coordinate an effective pandemic response.

This sort of seventh-best solution is typical of a vetocracy. I don\u2019t see that the US government is trying hard to reform institutions; its response is usually to make things more complex (like its healthcare legislation) or throw money at the problem. The proposed bill to increase domestic competitiveness against China, for example, doesn\u2019t substantially fix the science funding agencies that are more concerned with style guides than science; and the infrastructure bill doesn\u2019t seem to address root causes that make American infrastructure the most costly in the world. Congress is sending more money through bad channels.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Stop and savor.&nbsp;<span></span></p><a name=\"more\"></a><p></p><p>In the \"strategic competition\" with China,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>.. the US has demonstrated a superb capacity for self-harm... Entrepreneurial firms in China previously had no time for domestic technologies, preferring instead to buy the best, which is usually American. Then the US government designated them to various blacklists, giving them for the first time ever a business case for building up the domestic ecosystem. The result is that the US has turbo-charged Chinese competition by aligning the country\u2019s most dynamic firms more firmly with Beijing\u2019s self-sufficiency agenda. And in December, I wrote a piece for the Atlantic on US prosecutions of scientists. The state has subjected scientists to the tender mercies of the US criminal justice system, usually for charges related to relatively unimportant issues implicating research integrity. ..</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One redeeming fact for the US is that there has been significant domestic pushback to some of the government\u2019s actions\u2014especially the prosecutions of scientists\u2014such that it\u2019s within the realm of imagination that the US government will substantially modify bad policies. This sort of correction after public criticism is more difficult in China, where critics might end up jailed. The US though should take more seriously the task of cultivating both strong entrepreneurs and a strong state.</p></blockquote><div>A strong state, a strong civil society, and a strong scientific / technocratic establishment are &nbsp;ones that allow and responds to criticism that deviates from The Narrative. Here and in China.&nbsp;</div><p>Back to China, the point of the letter. Regional differences and the power of local governments are quite interesting. I can't effectively summarize observations on Beijing vs. Shanghai vs. Hong Kong vs.&nbsp;Shenzhen, so do read the original.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Beijing\u2019s control tendency isn\u2019t the only story in this country. That spirit is resented by Shanghai and Shenzhen, which mediates it with their commercial tendencies. Pushback from local governments can occasionally mitigate Beijing\u2019s worst ideas. Shanghai and Shenzhen are also sometimes able to help improve the institutional capacity in Beijing.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>On the recent regulatory crackdown:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When Beijing punished Ant Financial and DiDi, all of us were nervous that these companies were pawns in a game of elite politics whose rules aren\u2019t revealed to anyone who isn\u2019t a player. At this point, however, the punishment of these two firms looks rather small compared to everything that happened afterwards: the decapitation of online tutoring, new restrictions on video games, anti-monopoly actions against internet platforms, and passage of statutes governing data and privacy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>No small number of commentators have pointed out that any individual regulation passes muster on technocratic grounds. The US and Europe after all are debating rules with similar shapes\u2014although they would never implement them with China\u2019s speed and severity. I agree both with the commentators who see a sound technocratic foundation for these rules as well as with commentators like Naughton who note that they add up to an unprecedented new program of political control on firms. Beijing expects companies to comply not only with formal regulations but also to a broader ideological agenda.</p></blockquote><p>We will see how much US regulation of internet companies also forces conformity with an ideological agenda.&nbsp;</p><p>Hong Kong is no longer Milton Friedman's free market paradise:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>... Hong Kong was also the most bureaucratic city I\u2019ve ever lived in. Its business landscape has remained static for decades: the preserve of property developers that has created no noteworthy companies in the last three decades. That is a heritage of British colonial rule, in which administrators controlled economic elites by allocating land\u2014the city\u2019s most scarce resource\u2014to the more docile. Hong Kong bureaucrats enforce the pettiest rules, I felt, out of a sense of pride. On the mainland, enforcers deal often enough with senseless rules that they are sometimes able to look the other way. Thus a stagnant spirit hangs over the city.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>...Beijing locals have adapted to the proliferation of rules not with complete obedience, but discernment of which can be safely ignored.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Chinese exports, brands, and quality:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Chinese firms have not created many global brands, but I have confidence that will change. Entrepreneurs are still full of big dreams, having failed to receive the memo that globalization is dead. Those who sense foreign hostility towards China would keep their identity quiet, with the hope that the product quality will speak for itself. In segment after segment, I find that the quality of Chinese products has become strong. And I expect that good branding will follow good quality.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A metric of general quality improvement I like to use is the standardization of slow-casual chain restaurants. ...chains featuring Sichuan sauerkraut fish and Shaanxi breads and meat are now plausible and even fun places to go to lunch. Anyone in food management can tell you that it\u2019s hard to achieve a high degree of consistency across stores and across cities. That is something that Chinese managers have in recent years figured out.</p></blockquote><p>There used to be a Big Mac price index. A Big Mac corporate quality control index is a fun idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan is skeptical that social media is the investment of the future, as is the Chinese government.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>... Beijing will not be friendly towards the Metaverse. Already state media has expressed suspicion of the concept. If the Metaverse will exist in China, I expect it will be an extremely lame creation heavily policed by the Propaganda Department. ...The Metaverse, which represents yet another escape of American elites from the physical world,... is too much of a fun game, like cryptocurrencies, played by a small segment of the population, while the middle class dwells on more material concerns like paying for energy bills. It might make sense for San Franciscans to retreat even further into a digital phantasm, given how grim it is to go outside there. But Xi will want Chinese to live in the physical world to make babies, make steel, and make semiconductors.</p></blockquote><p>The question is whether the CCP will find useful alternative investments. Steel? Great Leap Forward II? I remain suspicious of the standard view the US must engage in a grand industrial policy \"strategic economic competition\" with China to \"dominate the industries of the future.\" The federal government is the one worse mechanism for capital allocation than markets. Even the positive examples are all unintended -- the space program was not funded extravagantly to produce Tang, Teflon, and microprocessors for social media. See instead fracking vs. ethanol in the energy innovation. But there is a worse allocation mechanism still: Let China's central planners figure out the industry of the future, and then try to outdo them on that one.&nbsp;</p><p>The conclusion -- parallel to the academic's call for more research --&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>To figure out how far decoupling will go, as well as a hundred other important questions, we\u2019ll need a better understanding of what\u2019s going on in China.</p></blockquote><p>Elsewhere</p><blockquote><p>The good and/or bad thing about China is that everything changes every 18 months. So it\u2019s all the more important to observe reality on the ground.... For newsrooms, that entails spending time away from Beijing. For the good of readers, papers should deploy journalists in places where politics is not the only concern, instead of devoting still more reporters in the capital to obsess over Xi Jinping Thought.</p></blockquote><p>However, from earlier, &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Beijing worsens the situation with its need to answer every insult with insult. It unfortunately cannot practice restraint by invoking the proverb: \u201cA decade is not too long for the gentleman to await his revenge.\u201d Like clockwork, every time China decides to push back against claims that it is too brutal, the government can\u2019t help but undertake an act of extraordinary pettiness to bully a critic. Last year, it expelled the cream of the western reporting corps for a reason still hard to believe today\u2014that the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal published an insensitive headline\u2014such that only a handful of reporters remain on the ground between the Journal, the Times, and the Post. This year, Beijing proved that there is no country, company, or individual too unimportant to be the subject of state-media tirades or state-sponsored economic punishment.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I.e.

It wasn\u2019t meant for the defiant Cubans, who weren\u2019t at liberty to read it and whose anger at their rulers clearly outweighed their concerns about contagion. It had to be aimed at English-speaking Americans. But to what end? American protests of the previous summer hadn\u2019t raised such cautions from the press. To the contrary. Our riots, if one could call them that (and one could not at many companies) were framed as transcendent cries for justice whose risks to public health were negligible, almost as though moral passion enhances immunity. And maybe it does, but why not in Cuba, too? To me, the headline only made sense in the context of the offensive against domestic \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d and its alleged fascist-bumpkin leaders. The Reuters writer had seen in Cuba\u2019s revolt a chance to glancingly editorialize against rebelliousness of another type.

Then the US government designated them to various blacklists, giving them for the first time ever a business case for building up the domestic ecosystem. The result is that the US has turbo-charged Chinese competition by aligning the country\u2019s most dynamic firms more firmly with Beijing\u2019s self-sufficiency agenda. And in December, I wrote a piece for the Atlantic on US prosecutions of scientists. The state has subjected scientists to the tender mercies of the US criminal justice system, usually for charges related to relatively unimportant issues implicating research integrity. ..One redeeming fact for the US is that there has been significant domestic pushback to some of the government\u2019s actions\u2014especially the prosecutions of scientists\u2014such that it\u2019s within the realm of imagination that the US government will substantially modify bad policies. This sort of correction after public criticism is more difficult in China, where critics might end up jailed. The US though should take more seriously the task of cultivating both strong entrepreneurs and a strong state.Back to China, the point of the letter. Regional differences and the power of local governments are quite interesting. I can't effectively summarize observations on Beijing vs. Shanghai vs. Hong Kong vs.\u00a0Shenzhen, so do read the original.\u00a0Beijing\u2019s control tendency isn\u2019t the only story in this country. That spirit is resented by Shanghai and Shenzhen, which mediates it with their commercial tendencies. Pushback from local governments can occasionally mitigate Beijing\u2019s worst ideas. Shanghai and Shenzhen are also sometimes able to help improve the institutional capacity in Beijing.\u00a0On the recent regulatory crackdown:\u00a0When Beijing punished Ant Financial and DiDi, all of us were nervous that these companies were pawns in a game of elite politics whose rules aren\u2019t revealed to anyone who isn\u2019t a player. At this point, however, the punishment of these two firms looks rather small compared to everything that happened afterwards: the decapitation of online tutoring, new restrictions on video games, anti-monopoly actions against internet platforms, and passage of statutes governing data and privacy.No small number of commentators have pointed out that any individual regulation passes muster on technocratic grounds. The US and Europe after all are debating rules with similar shapes\u2014although they would never implement them with China\u2019s speed and severity. I agree both with the commentators who see a sound technocratic foundation for these rules as well as with commentators like Naughton who note that they add up to an unprecedented new program of political control on firms. Beijing expects companies to comply not only with formal regulations but also to a broader ideological agenda.We will see how much US regulation of internet companies also forces conformity with an ideological agenda.\u00a0Hong Kong is no longer Milton Friedman's free market paradise:\u00a0... Hong Kong was also the most bureaucratic city I\u2019ve ever lived in. Its business landscape has remained static for decades: the preserve of property developers that has created no noteworthy companies in the last three decades. That is a heritage of British colonial rule, in which administrators controlled economic elites by allocating land\u2014the city\u2019s most scarce resource\u2014to the more docile. Hong Kong bureaucrats enforce the pettiest rules, I felt, out of a sense of pride. On the mainland, enforcers deal often enough with senseless rules that they are sometimes able to look the other way. Thus a stagnant spirit hangs over the city....Beijing locals have adapted to the proliferation of rules not with complete obedience, but discernment of which can be safely ignored.\u00a0Chinese exports, brands, and quality:\u00a0Chinese firms have not created many global brands, but I have confidence that will change. Entrepreneurs are still full of big dreams, having failed to receive the memo that globalization is dead. Those who sense foreign hostility towards China would keep their identity quiet, with the hope that the product quality will speak for itself. In segment after segment, I find that the quality of Chinese products has become strong. And I expect that good branding will follow good quality.A metric of general quality improvement I like to use is the standardization of slow-casual chain restaurants. ...chains featuring Sichuan sauerkraut fish and Shaanxi breads and meat are now plausible and even fun places to go to lunch. Anyone in food management can tell you that it\u2019s hard to achieve a high degree of consistency across stores and across cities. That is something that Chinese managers have in recent years figured out.There used to be a Big Mac price index. A Big Mac corporate quality control index is a fun idea.\u00a0Dan is skeptical that social media is the investment of the future, as is the Chinese government.\u00a0... Beijing will not be friendly towards the Metaverse. Already state media has expressed suspicion of the concept. If the Metaverse will exist in China, I expect it will be an extremely lame creation heavily policed by the Propaganda Department. ...The Metaverse, which represents yet another escape of American elites from the physical world,... is too much of a fun game, like cryptocurrencies, played by a small segment of the population, while the middle class dwells on more material concerns like paying for energy bills. It might make sense for San Franciscans to retreat even further into a digital phantasm, given how grim it is to go outside there. But Xi will want Chinese to live in the physical world to make babies, make steel, and make semiconductors.The question is whether the CCP will find useful alternative investments. Steel? Great Leap Forward II? I remain suspicious of the standard view the US must engage in a grand industrial policy \"strategic economic competition\" with China to \"dominate the industries of the future.\" The federal government is the one worse mechanism for capital allocation than markets. Even the positive examples are all unintended -- the space program was not funded extravagantly to produce Tang, Teflon, and microprocessors for social media. See instead fracking vs. ethanol in the energy innovation. But there is a worse allocation mechanism still: Let China's central planners figure out the industry of the future, and then try to outdo them on that one.\u00a0The conclusion -- parallel to the academic's call for more research --\u00a0To figure out how far decoupling will go, as well as a hundred other important questions, we\u2019ll need a better understanding of what\u2019s going on in China.ElsewhereThe good and/or bad thing about China is that everything changes every 18 months. So it\u2019s all the more important to observe reality on the ground.... For newsrooms, that entails spending time away from Beijing. For the good of readers, papers should deploy journalists in places where politics is not the only concern, instead of devoting still more reporters in the capital to obsess over Xi Jinping Thought.However, from earlier, \u00a0Beijing worsens the situation with its need to answer every insult with insult. It unfortunately cannot practice restraint by invoking the proverb: \u201cA decade is not too long for the gentleman to await his revenge.\u201d Like clockwork, every time China decides to push back against claims that it is too brutal, the government can\u2019t help but undertake an act of extraordinary pettiness to bully a critic. Last year, it expelled the cream of the western reporting corps for a reason still hard to believe today\u2014that the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal published an insensitive headline\u2014such that only a handful of reporters remain on the ground between the Journal, the Times, and the Post. This year, Beijing proved that there is no country, company, or individual too unimportant to be the subject of state-media tirades or state-sponsored economic punishment.\u00a0I.e. Lithuania. Well, now you know why there aren't journalists outside of Beijing.\u00a0*************Bari Weiss' favorite essays of 2021\u00a0 points to \"The Bullshit\"\u00a0by Walter Kim. Walter used to write for Time Magazine and writes scathingly on what has happened to media. In the final result, is our media really all that different than China's? Except that ours supports The Party's Narrative voluntarily.On the nature of the business:\u00a0Until business began to suffer, requiring cut-backs, the magazine kept an in-house research library, the better for checking even the smallest facts. The burden of accuracy lay heavy on Time. Its mighty name required nothing less....\u00a0the press used to maintain certain boundaries in the relationship, observing the incest taboo. It kept its pants zipped, at least in public. It didn\u2019t hire ex-CIA directors, top FBI men, NSA brass, or other past and future sources to sit beside its anchors at spot-lit news-desksOne great paragraph summarizes last year's Official Narratives, or more technically, \"bullshit\":\u00a0... Russian plots to counterfeit presidential children\u2019s laptops, viruses spawned in Wuhan market stalls, vast secret legions of domestic terrorists flashing one another the OK sign in shadowy parking lots behind Bass Pro Shops experiencing \u201ctemporary\u201d inflation, and patriotic tech conglomerates purging the commons of untruths. ...And Build Back Better. That\u2019s the sermon.More later,\u00a0The other day when Cuba erupted in protests, numerous stories explained the riots, confidently, instantly, as demands for COVID vaccines. The accompanying photos didn\u2019t support this claim; they featured ragged American flags and homemade signs demanding freedom. One wire-service headline used the protests to raise concerns about viral spread in crowds. A puzzling message. It wasn\u2019t meant for the defiant Cubans, who weren\u2019t at liberty to read it and whose anger at their rulers clearly outweighed their concerns about contagion. It had to be aimed at English-speaking Americans. But to what end? American protests of the previous summer hadn\u2019t raised such cautions from the press. To the contrary. Our riots, if one could call them that (and one could not at many companies) were framed as transcendent cries for justice whose risks to public health were negligible, almost as though moral passion enhances immunity. And maybe it does, but why not in Cuba, too? To me, the headline only made sense in the context of the offensive against domestic \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d and its alleged fascist-bumpkin leaders. The Reuters writer had seen in Cuba\u2019s revolt a chance to glancingly editorialize against rebelliousness of another type. The type its staff abhors day in, day out, no matter what\u2019s happening in Cuba, or, for that matter, in America. The bullshit is consistent in this way, reducing stories of every kind into nitrogen-rich soil for the same views. These views feel unusually ferocious now, reflecting the convictions of those on high that they should determine the fates of those on low with minimal backtalk and no laughter. Because science. Because Putin. Democracy. Because we\u2019re inside your phones and know your names.\u00a0Pious bullshit, unceasing.\u00a0On motivesComfort yourself with the thoughts that the same fortunes engaged in the building of amusement parks, the production and distribution of TV comedies, and the provision of computing services to the defense and intelligence establishments, have allied to protect your family\u2019s health, advance the causes of equity and justice, and safeguard our democratic institutions. Dismiss as cynical the notion that you, the reader, are not their client but their product. Your data for their bullshit, that\u2019s the deal.\u00a0But what to do?\u00a0One option, more popular each day, is to retreat to the anti-bullshit universe of alternative media sources. These are the podcasts, videos, Twitter threads, newsletters, and Facebook pages that regularly vanish from circulation for violating \u201ccommunity standards\u201d and other ineffable codes of conduct, oft-times after failing \u201cfact-checks\u201d by the friendly people at Good Thoughtkeeping. Some of these rebel outfits are engrossing, some dull and churchy, many quite bizarre, and some, despite small staffs and tiny budgets, remarkably good and getting better. Some are Substack pages owned by writers who severed ties with established publications, drawing charges of being Russian agents, crypto-anarchists, or free-speech \u201cabsolutists.\u201d ...Caveat emptor in the free-speech world: \u00a0This wilderness of \u201ccontrarianism\u201d \u2013 a designation easily earned these days; you merely have to mention Orwell or reside in Florida -- requires a measure of vigilance and effort from those who seek the truth there. ...A little reader skepticism would be a good habit in all cases.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the second essay pointed out by Bari Weiss (Walter Kim's essay):I am sorry to say, but that is nothing new. Whatever you may think of him, Mark Levin has a book called \"Unfreedom of the Press\", published way before Kim's essay.In general, I agree with the thrust of this post.There is also the matter of $6 trillion spent in counterproductive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.No one plans a military invasion of the U.S. Yet Washington outlays $1.4 trillion annually in defense costs (DoD, VA, DHS, black budget, pro-rated interest on the national debt). That is about $4200 for every man, woman, child and trans in the country, or almost $17,000 for a family of four.$17,000! And next year, and the year after that and into perpetuity will be even more.Reform? Alas, no, no, no. This is a lament, a garbage lament.\"Since the US government is incapable of structural reform ... \"Christ almighty, that's how it was designed. Do a reform and get a civil war, one on each issue.And, yes, the media here are different. There is more than one.None of us need agree. It's variety, competition, and free choice that matter. And we still have it.The essay was interesting, but how much of it is credible and how much falls into the incredible category?  \"A strong state, a strong civil society, and a strong scientific / technocratic establishment are  ones that allow and responds to criticism that deviates from The Narrative. Here and in China.\"--this is a fallacy.  You won't find the \"allow...deviates from the 'The Narrative'\"; but, you'll have plenty of \"responds to criticism that deviates from 'The Narrative'\", as in disappearing the deviates.  \"A strong scientific/technocratic establishment\" is a oligarchy of technocrats that set the norms and mores for those they admit to the establishment (guild-like).  The admonition today is \"Follow the Science!\"  It gets worse with the passage of time.  Phrases such as \"Climate Crisis\", \"Climate Change Emergency!\", etc., are intended to buffalo the unwary, the ignorant and the gulible.  It's succeeding.Dan Wong's essay describes some of the nature of that technocratic/scientific, strong state, etc., apparatus.  He doesn't touch on the more controversial aspects of that social order which have been described in the western press.  It's a totalist state, and as was demonstrated by the example made of Jack Ma, it has a long arm and it is willing to take arbitrary measures to rein in activities that do not conform to the established norms and mores of the state leadership.In the USA, we see a concerted effort guided by a handful of senators to overturn established order in the regulatory agencies governing the US financial sector.  It's a mini version of the totalist state control that pervades the PRC.  It's succeeding because no one, as yet, has mounted a concentrated response to counter it.Be careful what you wish for--you may get more of it than you bargained.Wang's arguments are just terrible. It is obvious why it appeared in the Atlantic.\"....oft-times after failing \u201cfact-checks\u201d by the friendly people at Good Thoughtkeeping.\"Perfect!Comments are welcome.

Fundamentally, inflation breaks out when people do not think the government will repay all its debts by eventually running fiscal surpluses. People then try to get rid of the debt and buy things instead, which drives up prices and lowers the real value of debt to what people believe the government will repay. Given that prices have risen 6%, people evidently believe that of the 30% debt expansion, the government will not repay at least 6%.

Given supply constraints from regulations, labor laws, and disincentives created by social programs, potential solutions here should be obvious.\u00a0*****A somewhat longer piece on the same themes is on its way, with documentation of the numbers and more explanation. The points here are also covered in more detail in the \"covid inflation\" chapter of Fiscal Theory of the Price Level. \u00a0What is your explanation for low interest rates on government securities?  If people are not convinced that the government will run surpluses in the future to repay debts, why are they holding the bonds?The Federal Reserve is the catalyst behind the ultra-low rates by monetizing the debt issued by treasuries. A good person to follow on this is @robinbrooksiif on twitter, the fed's holding of gov debt since GFC has skyrocketed while foreign ownership has plummeted. So it's not that \"people\" are willing to hold negative bearing gov bonds, it's the FED has stepped in at all costs to ensure the debt gets held, pushing down rates in the process.The bond market is predicting a recession Treasury yields price the Fed reaction function - nothing more.I don't think it is entirely relevant whether fiscal policy or monetary policy is the more powerful driver.  We have received double-barreled stimulus on both fronts.In normal times it is the job of the central bank to do the fine tuning.  If fiscal stimulus is excessive, the Fed can be restrictive.  But, these are not normal times.  But, it does feel like the central bankers are asleep.Given the number of times I have tried to buy something in the last 18 months and found that it is simply not available anywhere at any price, I am surprised we have not seen more inflation already.\"If people believe that less of the debt expansion will be repaid, then the price level will continue to rise, as much as 30%.\" As much as 30% if you think there won't be other X-trillion-dollar packages... These deficits might be changing peoples' perception of future deficits too.I'm afraid what you are doing over there in the US will soon arrive around here \"Had the government borrowed the entire $5 trillion to write the same checks, we likely would have the same inflation.\"As MIT '84, this troubles me. It's the new theory, I know. And it isn't willingness to hold money vs. bonds that's driving things. But is it maybe debt that will be repaid vs. debt that will not? The Chinese aren't buying debt now. Nor are Americans. Just the Fed, the buyer of last resort. This is a deep comment, which I've been thinking about for a while. The next essays will have more of this. If reserves are debt people do not think will be repaid and treasury debt is debt people think will be repaid, that makes a big difference. This comment has been removed by the author.Do you have any falsifiable inflation predictions? Are we in for a 30% price level increase? More? Less?Personally, I've been more convinced so far by the tilt toward goods from services explaining a great deal of the inflation we've seen. As such, I suppose I'd be on team transitory with a baseline expectation that inflation will normalize to the acceptable sub 4% range over the next year. What are your expectations?Fundamentally, inflation breaks out when people do not think the government will repay all its debts by eventually running fiscal surpluses.--John CochraneI dunno. Suppose I sell hot dogs from stand, $1 each. Things are in balance, I sell out by the end of the day, and my cart holds only 100 hot dogs.  Then, demand starts to creep up. I start to sell out before the end of the day. So, I take advantage and raise prices, and get back into balance.Vice-versa, if I can afford to accept a lower price.   When do I ponder Federal Reserve policy or government deficits? Don't I set prices daily based on demand? Also, if the Fed buys up a large amount of Treasuries...then are people assured the federal government can meet debt payments? After all, the interest payments on the Fed-owned Treasuries flow back into the Treasury. Japan? But why did demand for your hot dogs go up? Maybe people want fewer hamburgers? OK, but then the price of hamburgers goes down. How can people possibly spend more money on everything, to drive up the price of everything? Only if people are trying to get rid of money, and government debt in general. Aggregate demand is not demand, inflation is not a relative price change. Both Hot Dogs and Hamburgers \u201coriginate\u201d with the same livestock,, more or less.Reasonable to assume that the Hamburger Guys are low on supply too, and, of course raising prices\u2026My fear, being realized more and more every day, is that ~10% inflation is already baked-in across the board.This comment has been removed by the author.The price of everything can be driven up if the supply of everything is driven down. Imagine an isolated economy where some natural disaster destroys 10% of  all business facilities of every kind:  supply would go down and prices would go up.  In this case facilities weren't destroyed: but lockdowns, reduced production and widespread supply chain disruptions and the price of widely used commodities like oil rose and widely drove up the price of other things. Fiscal stimulus led some people to have more funds to spend to allow prices in general to rise rather than merely leading some prices to fall while others rose.The blog post said: \"If people wanted more TVs and fewer restaurant meals, the price of TVs would go up and the price of restaurant meals would go down.\"Except its more complicated than that: since covid led to people staying home more and buying goods for home use (I hadn't checked on whether TVs were included) and fewer meals out. However: even if competition would normally tend then to drive down restaurant meal prices, other factors like cost to comply with covid restrictions, reduced occupancy allowed, and worker shortages or workers demanding essentially a hazard pay premium for such jobs worked against that and applied to all the industry participants.The pandemic decimated small businesses: oddly I hadn't seen good data on that since relief programs did temporarily keep some afloat and there are supposedly a rise in some new businesses but I hadn't checked data (many I suspect are just individuals  who went freelance when unemployed,  either to actually get income or to collect the new unemployment for freelancers). Decimating small businesses led to less competition for some niches and more ability temporarily for oligopolies to increase prices in some niches or resist decreases in others. Oddly people talk about the high profits in some public companies: but thats a misleading picture since smaller companies are a different story. It is true that some  large companies benefited from the decimation of smaller ones, and of course some profited from the pandemic increasing demand for some things.  However also: companies with hope for the future often reinvest revenue into expansion rather than taking a profit. Sometimes profit taking means they  are \"saving for a rainy day\" rather than investing in expansion or fixing supply chain issues, etc. Small companies are likely doing the same. The production capacity needs to shift to deal with the shift in demand to restrain price increases: and that requires capital being spent, often borrowed capital.Yet last I checked (AIER had a post about it) bank lending hasn't recovered, or last I checked investment is still not up to where it should be even though the shift in demand and the decimated businesses should require capital to rebuild and fix the supply chain mess.  Again by analogy: picture it like a natural disaster physically destroyed 10% of business facilities and they needed to be rebuilt: capital would be needed. Of course instead: the government wants to take resources and focus on its programs rather than letting the private sector rebuild itself. Risk averse investors from overseas will turn to treasuries and keep those interest rates low, while not enough capital flows in to where its needed to rebuild which is more risky with an unpredictable pandemic going on and the economic situation uncertain. Investors that do take risks tend to be partly distracted with the \"everything bubbles\", stock prices detached from fundamentals, crypto, etc.\"Given supply constraints from regulations, labor laws, and disincentives created by social programs, potential solutions here should be obvious.\"I'm no Marxist, but I do believe in equitable compensation and treatment of labor.So, I'm curious: which ones do we get rid of?My old classes in Labor History point to a reality that when firms and labor play nice, there are productivity gains to be earned and shared, for it reduces churn, helps morale, and builds trust.Is it really a one time helicopter drop if the government is running primary deficits financed by the FED? Its not as if the US has been comitted to 0 debt growth this whole time and the share of the debt being paid by borrowed funds appears to be shrinking. Excellent analysis as usual. Would be helpful if the writer were to address the failure of TIPS and longs bonds to price this in. This comment has been removed by the author.\"If fiscal inflation does erupt, containing it will be difficult . . . with the debt-to-GDP ratio above 100%\"Agreed! Since 1800, 51 out of 52 countries with gross government debt greater than 130% have defaulted, either through restructuring, devaluation, high inflation or outright default. The US crossed that threshold in 2020 and thus seems highly likely to default through sustained high inflation.See pages 3 and 6 of this letter: https://tinyurl.com/bdftm3xnConsider a more intricate alternative theory.  Covid shocks induce a switch of demand from services to goods. The price of goods rises, but the price of services may not decline as easily as suggested. A goods producer facing slack demand will see inventories build up and need to reduce prices to get rid of excess inventory. But a service producer facing slack demand does not see a corresponding inventory build up.  An Uber driver who finds no passengers does not find the next day that his ride inventory has built up. Disney and American Airlines do not accumulate an inventory of unsold tickets. Further, the main cost of most services is labor, and as noted by Dr. Cochrane, labor is becoming more expensive and difficult to find due to government policy. If price is near marginal cost, service providers may even increase prices to compensate for higher labor costs and make due with far lower demand.  Growth in money supply is not required, but the theory predicts we see inflation in the goods sector, lower real GDP in the services sector, overall nominal GDP is unchanged, overall real GDP is lower, and higher overall inflation.   I find this to be a compelling argument. Would be interested to hear the author's rebuttal.Downwardly sticky prices in service industries. Possible, but it means those prices decline eventually, and inflation does not just go away, inflation reverses and we get back to the old price level. That does not seem to be in the cards. BTW, I get 1000 words and used 998, so I can't treat every possible complication. Sorry, but I think the logic here is flawed. \"But a service producer facing slack demand does not see a corresponding inventory build up.\"Actually service providers will find their are \"building up\" time sitting idle. A consultant will find less billable hours, an uber driver sitting in the car idle, etc. Prices may or may not be sticky, but the reason they are or are not is independent of whether it's a physical good or a service.\"Uber driver who finds no passengers does not find the next day that his ride inventory has built up. Disney and American Airlines do not accumulate an inventory of unsold tickets.\"Again, this might be an argument for how a supply chain is affected (bull whip effect, etc.) but the behavioral/economic implication is no different.  The marginal cost of additional hours or the same seat on a flight remaining empty day after day increases with time.IMHO, good economic modelling recognizes that individuals only value services, not goods themselves (they value the services derived from the physical goods), and we should think in terms of marginal benefits and marginal costs.  There's no fundamental economic analysis difference between the service industry and the goods industry.  Once you recognize the \"goods\" themselves are fundamentally again just inputs to a technology providing the services individuals are actually deriving utility from then it's exactly the same in every regard. The empty seat on a place is the good unsold and so is the hamburger cooked but not sold. Both are inputs to a final service, unsold.  The burger has a higher depreciation rate of course (and other \"goods\" might have lower depreciation rates), but otherwise the same.Travel services clearly saw downward price adjustments in the face of less demand. I don't think inventory levels is the driver of firm behavior - I think demand is.Comments are welcome. Keep it short, polite, and on topic. Thanks to a few abusers I am now moderating comments.

Brooklyn-based artist Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey, Flower-Headed Children, speaks to this intersectionality, challenging visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.\u00a0The artist founded the South Asian Women\u2019s Creative Coalition (SAWCC), a nonprofit organization focusing on \u201cadvancement, visibility, and development of emerging and established South Asian womxn artists,\u201d according to its official website. She also previously worked as the director of public events and projects at the Queens Museum of Art, among other contributions to the art world. While some of the pieces in the exhibition are deeply intimate, others capture a collective energy.\u00a0Jasmine Blooms at Night (2021), an installation composed of multiple portraits, pays homage to South Asian feminist activists throughout the country, including Dr. Anjali Arondekar, who wrote the book For the Record: On Sexuality and the Colonial Archive in India, and queer Sri Lankan performance artist, activist, organizer, and educator YaliniDream. Abichandani highlights the rise of South Asian women in United States politics, in particular Vice President Kamala Harris and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. \u201cKamala\u2019s Inheritance\u201d reflects the artist\u2019s perspective on Harris as a hopeful figure \u2014 a South Asian and Black woman in politics, whose presence will potentially usher in even more women of color \u2014 but also someone with \u201chubris, which can push her toward positions that have more flash than substance,\u201d according to the artwork\u2019s walls text. The symbols in the piece reference Greek mythology, Hindu religion (specifically the lotus flower), and American imperialism.\u201cMona,\u201d a portrait of Mona Eltahawy, likens the journalist to the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet. Eltahawy\u2019s bright red hair fits the overall opulence of the work, comprised of paint, plastic, mirrored glass, and fabric. The portrait expresses her uncompromising personality as she holds up two middle fingers.Other works reference the #MeToo moment, protest, and community action, spotlighting Abichandani\u2019s 2017 performance at the Met Breuer in which she asked 30 people to join her for a #MeToo demonstration. The action took place during photographer Raghubir Singh\u2019s retrospective; Abichandani alleged that Singh assaulted her, and openly shared her story.\u00a0The exhibition\u2019s text, printed on a bright gold wall, explains that Abichandani\u2019s works \u201cbroaden American art audiences\u2019 appreciation of aesthetics that represent an unfamiliar cultural experience.\u201d The show embraces visual sumptuousness; some pieces glitter from every angle.\u201cUnlike other immigrant communities, South Asians have yet to establish institutions for contemporary art and culture,\u201d the show\u2019s curator, Anuradha Vikram, wrote in an ArtNews article in 2019. \u201cOur institutions tend to be houses of worship, folkloric programs, and schools for the classical arts.\u201d Overall, Vikram explains, \u201cattention devoted to contemporary art by South Asians working in the US is rare.\u201d\u00a0The show asks viewers to check their assumptions, and question their reactions to each piece. Abichandani argues that South Asian devotional art and queer culture have both been regarded as strange and other within (mostly straight, White) Euro-American society. She embraces and exalts queer culture in the show. \u201cTwo Boys in Saris\u201d (2018) is installed on its own pedestal, painted gold to match the surrounding walls. It showcases the artist\u2019s integration of devotional images with modern queer aesthetics; the jewelry and clothing on each figure nod to Hindu traditions of dressing idols in temples, while elements like bright blue lipstick speak to liberation in fashion. It portrays two queer Muslim performance artists whose poses point to Bollywood themes. \u00a0 \u00a0The show is a reminder that South Asian contemporary artists are ready to be heard, whether or not institutions want to catch up.\u00a0Jaishri Abichandani: Flower-Headed Children continues at Craft Contemporary (5814 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California) through May 8.

Washington\u201d (c. 1789). It contains hair from a dead teenager, along with an image of her spirit breaking free from a tomb. The object exemplifies the ways that the exhibition \u2014 which includes over 150 works from the 18th century to the present, by artists who span all different backgrounds and cultures \u2014elucidates dialogues between past and present, and between this world and realms beyond.The exhibition avoids trivializing artists\u2019 beliefs. One painting, \u201cPrecipitated Portraits of Lizzie, Mary and Christina Daugherty with Dr. Daugherty\u201d (c. 1900), created as part of a seance with medium sisters Mary E. (May) and Elizabeth Snow (Lizzie) Bangs, credits \u201cspirits\u201d along with the Bangs sisters. The painting seems to be haunted.\u00a0Similarly, ghostly double-exposed photographs by spirit photographer William H. Mumler likely catch the viewer\u2019s breath as they did 150 years ago, when Spiritualism, the religious movement that posited the possibility of communication with souls of the dead, was in full swing.\u00a0These are all part of the exhibition\u2019s first section, which contemplates the United States as a haunted place, encompassing US history and land, and the institution of slavery as foundational to this country.\u00a0Two visceral abstract heads by Jack Whitten, \u201cHead 1\u201d and \u201cForm (3rd Set) 1\u201d (both 1965), swirl in a fog. The artist believed they carried the spirit of Henry Wells, a freedman lynched in 1878. Painted in the Civil Rights era, they act as spiritual testament to protests against racist violence currently being waged around the country.In her magnetic charcoal and chalk drawing \u201cAcheron\u201d (2016), named for the Greek god of the underworld\u2019s river, Alison Saar depicts the African and diaspora archetype, and mythological water spirit, \u201cMami Wata\u201d (Mother Water) standing up to her waist in water. In the river\u2019s reflection, the basket she carries on her head appears to contain ghoulish skulls. Saar invokes spirits to speak to centuries of violence committed against people of color, while looking to the mythological spirit as a guide to healing and liberation.The second section includes surrealist artists like Dorothea Tanning, whose twisted images of mystical beings in her painting \u201cGuardian Angels\u201d (1946) emanate a mysterious energy. Gertrude Abercrombie\u2019s gothic shadow play in \u201cStrange Shadows (Shadow and Substance)\u201d (1950) is delightfully eerie, while Benjamin West\u2019s 1777 painting, \u201cSaul and the Witch of Endor,\u201d is one of the few Biblical works in the exhibition.\u00a0Another section focuses on mediumship and contains items like Ouija boards and spirit catchers, while the last section ponders UFOs and dimensions beyond our universe, often based on artists\u2019 personal experiences. Chris Pappan, who is Osage, Kaw, and Cheyenne River Lakota Sioux, turns to UFOs to address the politics of colonialism and white supremacy. Pappan reframes colonialism as an alien attack in \u201cAnother Incident at the Big Chief\u201d (2021) and \u201cSee Haw Directs an Alien Invasion from the West\u201d (1996). The works, rendered on municipal documents from the 1920s, draw from the Native American ledger art tradition, which often illustrated historical events; Pappan\u2019s work offers a kind of alternative history through the alien metaphor.\u00a0Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power. They reveal the ghosts that linger in our collective psyche. In a time when we are still grappling with the unimaginable losses of COVID-19 and racial reckonings that ignited in 2020, the exhibition asks us to acknowledge, if not necessarily make peace with, our country\u2019s haunted spirit.\u00a0Supernatural America: The Paranormal in American Art continues at the Minneapolis Institute of Art (2400 Third Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota) through May 15.

So when I spoke with fashion designer Patricia Michaels, or Water Lily (Taos Pueblo), she spoke carefully but excitedly about her design company PM Waterlily\u2019s collection for this year\u2019s SWAIA\u2019s Santa Fe Indian Market fashion show. Since 1922, the Santa Fe Indian Market has been the premiere venue for artists coming from tribal nations throughout the United States to show and sell their work. Historically founded to combat the erasure of Indigenous peoples and their cultures, the event transforms the Santa Fe plaza for one weekend in August in celebration and support of Native artists.Water Lily, who has maintained a presence at Indian Market since birth, says, \u201cI feel like the team that I\u2019m building and the team that I\u2019ll continue to work with is right on board with me. They\u2019re excited \u2026 my couture looks that will be on the runway will be exciting, but so will the ready-to-wear.\u201dAn alumna of the Institute of American Indian Arts and The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Water Lily\u2019s training also includes apprenticeships with the Santa Fe Opera\u2019s costume designer and a tailor in Milan, Italy. In 2014, she received the prestigious Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian Arts and Design Award. And although Water Lily had been designing for nearly three decades prior, including gaining national recognition for her work in the 2015 Peabody Essex Museum show Native Fashion Now, she found mainstream recognition as runner-up of Project Runway during Season 11. This pop culture appearance brought the designer\u2019s Native-inspired haute couture fashion to New York and audiences around the world \u2014 a historical first.PM Waterlily\u2019s original and innovative designs for the Santa Fe Indian Market centennial incorporate her handmade signature detailing such as dying, painting, felting, and beading that reference \u2014 and sometimes reframe \u2014 the Southwestern landscape and textiles of Northern New Mexico\u2019s Native Pueblo cultures. Her previous collections have featured wools from local Taos farms, sheer fabrics with gestural brushstrokes, black geometric patterns inspired by Anasazi pottery, bright red and rich fuschia of mountain berries and desert blooms, and metallic detailing informed by the micaceous pottery of the region. Glimpses of her designs can be seen on her TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook accounts and at Malouf on the Plaza in Santa Fe.\u201cIt definitely is exciting \u2026 The honor of being able to be at Indian Market \u2014 it\u2019s such an important centennial [and] time in history that I feel a responsibility to heighten my expression,\u201d she says.Currently working outside of Santa Fe, Water Lily joked about the chaos happening in her studio as she juggles the collection for Indian Market and alongside her other projects. For example, she\u2019s been creating costumes for performances by Opera Lafayette (Washington, DC) of Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9ry\u2019s Silvain, which tells a story of farmers in the 1860s in the territory of what today is northern New Mexico. She took on the project in part to incorporate a part of New Mexico culture she has been eager to explore through fashion. Informing her designs for the opera is the art of Spanish colonial New Mexico, ranging from carved and painted woodworking of santero artists (makers of religious imagery) to wool and cotton techniques of colcha embroidery, offering a contemporary interpretation of life and fashion during the state\u2019s territorial period.When I asked her specifically about this year\u2019s centennial Indian Market, she became overwhelmed by what the milestone means for her and for the numerous artists and families that have participated in the market for decades. Thinking about the number of artworks that Indigenous artists have made over 100 years, she says, \u201cWhen you go into Indian Market, just remember that there are prayers in every single piece of art on the plaza.\u201d Adding to this, the artworks at Indian Market are testaments to cultural survival and community resilience, which she and her family carry on with their work.\u00a0\u00a0While reflecting on her inspirations, Water Lily was candid about the early pushback she received at Indian Market. \u201cWhen I first wanted to do a fashion show and [market organizers] wouldn\u2019t let me because, they said I was taking away from tradition, and I had my booth protested \u2026 I [remained] headstrong about doing a contemporary fashion show.\u201dDespite the resistance to include a fashion show in 1992, she continued to advocate for the opportunity to debut her designs the way they were intended to be shown: on a catwalk. As a fashion designer who is Indigenous, Water Lily refused to conform to rigid demands designated by \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d Native American art \u2014 labels that were invented and implemented by non-Native organizers. Instead, she, like many Native artists, celebrates her culture through dialogues with the past combined with innovation grounded in the world today and in the future. Thirty years later, Indian Market would seem incomplete without the annual fashion show that she adamantly pushed for, and that will hopefully continue for the next 100 years.\u00a0\u00a0In anticipation of this year\u2019s market, Water Lily mentions that she and her team are celebrating the people they have worked with over the years.

Now organized by the Southwest Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA), Indian Market was first held in 1922, and as the event prepares to celebrate its centennial anniversary, it has grown to include over 1,200 Indigenous artists from across the United States and Canada. Indian Market, and the many concurrent satellite events which include performances, exhibitions, lectures, screenings, and more, features artists working across an extraordinary variety of media.Although this year\u2019s participating artists are yet to be announced, one thread is continuous: Storytelling is central in much of Native American art, and the work being produced by Indigenous jewelers is no exception. Native jewelry, whether based in historical practice, contemporary innovation, or somewhere in between, carries the identities and histories of the artists and craftspeople who created it; jewelry allows us to carry those stories with us and on us. The work of Alaskan Native Denise Wallace (Chugach Sugpiaq/Alutiiq), a longtime staple of Indian Market, exemplifies these facts. Winner of the Best of Show award for Jewelry at the 2021 Market, stories and histories are at the heart of Wallace\u2019s work.But her winning piece from 2021 Indian Market, Origins, Roots, and Sources, is an impeccable example of her work. The belt, like many of her best-known pieces, utilizes precious metals, custom stonework, scrimshaw, intricate mechanisms, and hidden transformative elements to create works that speak with her unique voice. Featuring masks and figures that, according to Wallace, \u201care based in the history of our country,\u201d she incorporates traditional stories with references to history, environmental fears, and current politics. The work also contains specific allusions to missing and murdered indigenous women, to two-spirit people, and civil rights leaders Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (the figure representing Ginsburg references the following quote from the late Supreme Court Justice, \u201cI ask no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.\u201d) Wallace\u2019s work here honors the labor and sacrifices of those who came before us, while recognizing that a great deal of work still lies ahead.\u201cI don\u2019t really think of myself as a jeweler,\u201d says Wallace. \u201cI see myself as a storyteller. I\u2019m not just making adornment. There\u2019s history, personal energy, there\u2019s my story.\u201d Speaking of art more broadly she says, \u201cIt\u2019s all about storytelling. We\u2019re continuing our histories and stories. We build on the craft of the people who come before us, and the people who come after will build on top of what we make.\u201dIndigenous adornment practices aren\u2019t limited to jewelry made in precious metal and stones. Indigenous artworks that adorn the body include textiles, beadwork, quillwork, found objects, and more. Hollis Chitto (Choctaw, Laguna and Isleta Pueblos) is an artist who practices traditional beadwork, but the body and its ability to serve as a vessel for histories and identity are central ideas that inform this work. Hailing from Santa Fe, Hollis grew up in an environment surrounded by art. He had his first experience showing work at Indian Market at five years old with his father (esteemed Mississippi Choctaw sculptor and ceramics artist Randy Chitto) and began learning beading at the age of ten.\u00a0Chitto\u2019s bag \u201cIn Honor of Pukni\u201d references his personal connection to beadwork through his family. \u201cI made this bag in honor of my grandmother. My father\u2019s mother helped provide for her family in Chicago by selling her beadwork,\u201d he explains. The bag features Southeast style abstract floral designs, as well as appliqu\u00e9 in silk ribbon that mimics the diamond pattern found on the backs of rattlesnakes. \u201cAlthough I never had the privilege of learning the art form from her, I believe everything I make is an extension of her love for her family,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhen I asked my dad if pukni would be proud of my work, he said, \u2018She would be blown away, but ask why are you using such small beads?\u2019 \u201dChitto, who identifies as two-spirit, says of adornment, \u201cWhat we put on our bodies is a statement. It signals identity, culture, gender, socio-economic status and more. What a person wears tells the story of who that person is. It shows who you are to the world and as Indigenous people our identities are wrapped up in storytelling.\u201d His bag \u201cBloodwork No. 2\u201d exemplifies the connection between Indigenous bodies and the stories they carry. This bag features a colorful example of floral beadwork interrupted by a cascade of red evocative of flowing blood, a weighty symbol for Native and LGBTQ2+ people alike.\u201cThe blood in our veins is what gives us life. Its importance is celebrated in various tribes as a fact. Unfortunately, it is this same substance that is at risk for a sickness that is taking a portion of our people,\u201d Chitto says of this work.\u201cThe taboos of speaking openly about unsafe sex and high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use have only served to add to new infection rates due to ignorance. My goal for this piece is to act as a starting point of discussion about this topic. The blood down the center is the elephant in the room; we all have it, so few of us give it a second thought unless we need to.\u201dSpeaking on the topic of non-Natives wearing Indigenous adornment, Chitto says, \u201cA lot of bead workers get the question from non-native \u2014 \u2018Is it okay to wear this?\u2019 The question is coming from a good place \u2026 So long as the work is purchased from a Native artist, and so long as you are engaging with the culture respectfully, then you\u2019re good. That interaction and engagement becomes a part of your story.\u201d Denise Wallace echoes this sentiment, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious when people are appropriating culture in a disrespectful way, but when a person buys and wears a piece of jewelry, they are supporting that artist\u2019s community and promoting the culture.\u201dJaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

He cannot understand why this woman has committed such brutal crimes against men. He says it\u2019s \u201clike a work of fiction\u201d while the other detective on the case says, \u201cNo one can understand why she did what she did.\u201d But I disagree.The reasons for this killing spree that these men can\u2019t account for are clear to me given America\u2019s history of male violence. In the 2003 film Monster, we see Charlize Theron enter into a trauma response every time she gets into a car with a man: She is paranoid and on guard. From what is insinuated of Wuornos\u2019s long history of experiences of abuse by men, this response is to be expected. A triggered woman is not a mystery. Monster succeeds where this docuseries from the perspective of the investigators fails, because it comprehends the pain and abuse that made Wuornos into someone the Catching Killers detectives can\u2019t wrap their heads around.In contrast, the cishet male murderer holds a coveted spot in the cultural imagination. He is typically depicted as worldly wise, having great taste in music and art, for example Hannibal Lecter \u2014 as played by Anthony Hopkins or Joe Goldberg as played by Penn Badgley on the televised series You. These male murderers have instincts to violence that they cannot resist. They are presented as an inevitable evil; they cannot change their predatory nature.When I think of Wuornos, I think also of Elisabetta Sirani\u2019s painting \u201cTimoclea Killing Her Rapist\u201d(1659). Timoclea forcing her attacker down the well is a striking image. His legs are spread apart, mimicking a pose perhaps similar to one he may have forced her into when he assaulted her. With this swift movement, Timoclea shifts the power dynamic. Male violence makes way for the revenge of the oppressed woman. Wuornos may not have chosen the right men for the well, but her anger can definitely be understood.We have too many depictions of male murders, men who kill because they have a compulsive tendency to violence. I want to see more women whose rage knows no bounds, who refuse to turn their hatred into self-destruction. We need to see the cultural history of female violence as a history of retaliation, a fuck-you to the patriarchal violence women consistently experience. We need a space for our anger. Women\u2019s rage deserves to be unpacked and understood as more than bunny boiler hysterics because like Serani\u2019s Timoclea, a woman killing her rapist flips the patriarchal hierarchy, upending the male violence that still dominates perspectives on women in our visual culture. \u00a0Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

Ancient palettes in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the British Museum in London, and the Louvre in Paris \u2014 among other institutions \u2014 number in the single digits. This is even more surprising now that scholars know ancient Greek and Roman statues were vibrantly painted.\u00a0The palettes we do have, many of which still contain traces of original pigment, show us how people painted, but they also tell us about the role of the painter in ancient civilizations.Most of the existing paint boxes and palettes are Ancient Egyptian: They belonged to scribes, tomb painters, and recreational painters of the upper classes. Some include the original brushes \u2014 for scribes, pen-like lengths of rush grass, and for professional and recreational illustrators, thicker bundles of grass to compose larger images.Scribes\u2019 palettes mostly held only red and black pigments and many bear inscriptions of the king\u2019s name, suggesting the importance of the scribe in the eyes of the ruler. Inscriptions with the king\u2019s name \u2014 as in a palette at the British Museum featuring hieroglyphs in high relief that read \u201cthe perfect god, lord of the Two Lands, Nebpehtire, s[on of Ra, Ahmose]\u201d \u2014 may have noted that the owner was the king\u2019s official scribe and suggest that perhaps the king himself gave the palette to the scribe.An Ancient Egyptian painting palette owned by a professional painter and housed at the Met also bears the king\u2019s name, but one at the Cleveland Museum of Art includes the name of the owner himself, signifying it was likely used for leisurely painting. Unlike scribes\u2019 bicolor palettes, recreational and tomb painters used a wider range of colors, all naturally occurring besides so-called \u201cEgyptian blue.\u201d\u00a0Replacing the expensive lapis lazuli, Egyptian blue was a synthetic compound made by heating malachite, sand, and other materials to a temperature of 1,500-2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The method was adopted by the Ancient Romans, but by the Middle Ages, the process was lost, and painters relied once again on the prohibitively expensive lapis lazuli.In Ancient Egypt, blue was used to paint the gods (red, yellow, black, and green all came from the ground, making them unfit to depict deities). This concept is seen again in Christian art centuries later, with Mary and Jesus repeatedly depicted in blue.\u00a0Across the world and made centuries after the Egyptian palettes, another ancient paint set links the painter to the divine.\u00a0A group of pigment jars from Teotihuac\u00e1n, near current-day Mexico City, are arranged in the \u201cquincunx,\u201d an important religious and astrological symbol found throughout ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. In the quincunx, four objects surround a higher central object, which symbolizes the center of the universe. The symbol has been found throughout Teotihuac\u00e1n in arrangements of dots used to calculate time. Scholars have argued that four-sided pyramids, like the central Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuac\u00e1n, reflect the quincunx because the four sets of stairs lead to a higher, sacred site.\u00a0The Teotihuac\u00e1n culture had no writing system, relying instead on images painted on pottery and murals which used relationships and metaphors to relay meaning. In an essay accompanying the Met\u2019s set of painting jars, the author argues that mixing the colors was seen as a haphazard moral shortcoming, one that would be in contradiction to the jars\u2019 divine quincunx shape.Inscriptions and meaning in paint sets from Ancient Egypt and Teotihuac\u00e1n define them as culturally significant objects and show that their owners too were culturally significant. But despite the clear historical, religious, and political importance of painting and record keeping \u2014 and all of the ancient painted objects in our museums \u2014 it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.\u00a0\u00a0In an interview with the Atlantic, author of Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color Philip Ball discussed how the study of paint itself is largely outside the realm of traditional art history and criticism. \u201cIt seems to be largely restricted to conservators at museums who, of necessity, have to know something about the material aspects of the works as well as the art-historical context,\u201d Ball said.\u00a0\u201cBy not understanding these craft aspects of making art, we run the risk of imagining that art is just about having the idea rather than about actually having to go about creating it,\u201d Ball continued. \u201cI do think this is a perspective that has been underplayed in conventional art history and art criticism, and that it could be brought closer to the fore.\u201dJaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

Hecht Jr., who was accused of trafficking in looted art.", "text": "Hyperallergic\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\tOver the past two decades, Dr. Christos Tsirogiannis has identified upwards of 1,500 looted antiquities by scouring museum holdings and auction house offerings, and matching up objects of dubious provenance with photos taken from the archives of disgraced dealers. Now, the Denmark-based professor, former field archaeologist, vigilante provenance researcher, and repatriation advocate \u2014 whom convicted antiquities trafficker Giacomo Medici characterized as \u201cdoing terrorism toward the auction houses and the museums\u201d \u2014 is calling upon the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles to repatriate an ancient Roman fresco fragment. The 23-by-17 inch painting scrap, he says, is linked to American art antiquities dealer Robert E. Hecht Jr., who was accused of trafficking in looted art.For six decades, Hecht sold Mediterranean antiquities to leading museums and prominent private collectors. He regularly supplied the Getty Museum with artifacts in the 1980s and 1990s and allegedly participated in a tax fraud scheme that involved private collectors donating trafficked antiquities to the Getty. After a raid of Medici\u2019s warehouse of unprovenanced artifacts in 1995, Italy began to investigate Hecht for his part in an international antiquities trafficking operation; Hecht had, for example, acquired a looted Etruscan vase from Medici, which he sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. (It was repatriated in 2006.) Shortly after Medici was convicted in 2004, Hecht was indicted, along with Getty Museum antiquities curator Marion True. For Hecht and True, the multi-year trial ended without a conviction when the statute of limitations on the charges expired. Hecht died shortly after the case ended in 2012.When French and Italian officials raided Hecht\u2019s apartment in 2001, they found his personal memoir along with \u201cletters, antiquities covered with soil and wrapped in plastic shopping bags, as well as Polaroid and regular-print images depicting restored and unrestored antiquities, some still \u2018very dirty with earth,\u2019\u201d Tsirogiannis wrote in his article \u201cNekyia: \u2018Woman on a balcony\u2019 at the Jean Paul Getty Museum,\u201d published in the Journal of Art Crime in December 2019. The researcher \u2014 who has traced numerous artifacts to Hecht, including a helmet currently on offer at Christie\u2019s \u2014 describes a bundle of photographs, connected to one another with string, depicting antiquities ranging from vases to figurines to mosaics. A fresco fragment currently on view at the Getty Villa was among the antiquities in the photos, he says. \u201cWoman on a Balcony\u201d is believed to be part of a large Roman Second Style wall painting, which perhaps decorated a dining room. It was painted in Italy \u2014 Tsirogiannis suspects that it was made in Pompeii \u2014 sometime between 10 BCE and 14 CE. In the image, a woman in a loose tunic and matching cap drinks from a cup as she balances a pitcher against a balcony railing. The fragment belonged to antiquities collectors Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman, who first exhibited the work publicly with the Getty in 1994 and donated it to the museum \u2014 along with 287 other objects \u2014 in 1996. The Getty also purchased 33 artifacts from the Fleischman collection.Tsirogiannis explains in his article that the Getty recently updated the online provenance for the object and revealed that the Fleischmans acquired the fragment from Fritz B\u00fcrki, who regularly acted as a criminal front for Hecht, according to Tsirogiannis, who cites Peter Watson and Cecilia Todeschini\u2019s 2007 book The Medici Conspiracy. In 2007, two years after the museum\u2019s antiquities curator was indicted for trafficking, the Getty repatriated 40 objects to Italy. One of the objects in the return was a second fresco fragment \u2014 a Pomepiian lunette depicting Hercules \u2014 that the Fleischmans had also acquired from B\u00fcrki, making \u201cWoman on a Balcony\u201d even more suspect.Tsirogiannis brought his findings to the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, which has a task force that is dedicated to fighting antiquities trafficking.\u201cThe next steps regarding the repatriation of the fresco to Italy, belong exclusively to the Manhattan DA\u2019s Office, after I sent them, last January, my academic article \u2026 which includes all the relevant evidence and information,\u201d Tsirogiannis told Hyperallergic.\u201cIt is important that the fresco be returned because it belongs to Italy and because there will be a chance to be re-contextualized,\u201d Tsirogiannis continued. \u201cSooner or later it will help the Italian archaeological service to locate the exact monument and the exact part of a wall at this monument from where originally the fresco was cut off.\u201dLord Colin Renfrew, a leading archeologist at the University of Cambridge,\u00a0questioned the legitimacy of the fragment\u2019s provenance in 2000 and has recently\u00a0echoed calls for the fragment\u2019s return. \u201cOne can presume it to be looted when it really has no respectable provenance,\u201d Renfrew told the\u00a0Observer. \u201cYou need a provenance going back to the beginning of the century to be of any value.\u201dWhen Hyperallergic reached out to the museum for comment, a spokesperson said: \u201cGetty continually researches the background and provenance of items within its collection and considers new evidence when it is presented.

Recognizing that arts and culture are key catalysts for the recovery of the city\u2019s financial health, the plan announced a \u201cCulture at Risk\u201d response team to assist arts and nightlife businesses on the brink of closure and a \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d cultural district on Governors Island. Just a month earlier, however, the mayor released a preliminary budget for fiscal year 2023 that proposes slashing one-third of the city\u2019s culture budget. So how does the mayor\u2019s grandiose rhetoric about New York\u2019s cultural comeback match up with his budgetary policy? The \u201cRebuild, Renew, Reinvent\u201d plan blueprint aims to \u201caccelerate\u201d NYC\u2019s economic recovery through investment in the small business, tourism, and arts and culture sectors. With 400,000 jobs lost since the pandemic hit in 2020, the plan states restoring employment in the city to a \u201cpre-pandemic level\u201d as its primary goal.  As expected of Mayor Adams, who ran for office on a tough-on-crime\u00a0platform, one of the prerequisites to \u201crestarting the city\u2019s economic engines\u201d is tackling public safety concerns including gun violence and homelessness. The plan also calls on employees to return to in-person work, another message the mayor has pushed aggressively for months. In a style reminiscent of former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, the document is interspersed with flattering images of Adams shaking hands with workers and small business owners, posing for the camera holding signed paperwork, and overlooking the city\u2019s skyline from a skyscraper window. New York\u2019s arts sector was among the hardest hit during the pandemic, per a\u00a0report by the state comptroller\u00a0from last February. The report found that two-thirds of all arts, entertainment, and recreation jobs in the city vaporized in 2020. An even deeper crisis\u00a0faces immigrant artists\u00a0in the city, who report diminished livelihood\u00a0sources with little to no aid from local authorities.\u00a0In a survey of 643 community-based New York arts organizations conducted by Americans for the Arts and published by the think tank Center for an Urban Future (CUF) last year, one-quarter of all cultural organizations located in lower-income zip codes across the city reported losing access to their only physical space during the pandemic. \u201cThe blueprint comes at an incredibly pivotal time for the arts,\u201d said Eli Dvorkin, CUF\u2019s editorial and policy director, in an interview with Hyperallergic. \u201cWe see, for example, that even as performing arts employment has been ticking back up in recent quarters, it\u2019s still down about 36% from 2019.\u201d Dvorkin welcomed the proposals in the blueprint but expressed doubts as to whether they would be backed with sufficient funding. \u201cThere are some really positive things in this blueprint but not much of it will be possible without allocating some real funding behind it,\u201d he said.The city\u2019s preliminary $98.5 billion budget for fiscal year 2023, unveiled in mid-February, focuses on slashing spending in favor of a record level of budget reserves. It allocates $145.5 million for the city\u2019s Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA), down from $230.1 million in 2022. The $84.6 million cuts, which amount to 36.8% of the DCLA\u2019s 2022 budget, include the loss of $12 million in one-time federal funding last year that was used to support the city\u2019s $25 million WPA-style City Artist Corps program. Still, it\u2019s a major hit for the DCLA, which would receive $72 million less in city funding in the coming fiscal year. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s Correction Department would enjoy a funding increase from about $800 million to $1.2 billion, and the New York Police Department\u2019s budget would remain flat.The DCLA, known as the country\u2019s largest\u00a0cultural funding agency, gets 99.8% of its financial support from the city. If approved, the 2023 budget would take away almost $57 million from the agency\u2019s grantmaking funds, limiting its ability to continue supporting over 1,200 cultural organizations and thousands of individual artists in its constituency.To further complicate matters, last week, Adams appointed Laurie Cumbo, a former council member with a history of racially insensitive remarks, to head the DCLA. Cumbo notoriously opposed legislation that grants noncitizens in the city the right to vote and has made controversial statements about NYC\u2019s Asian and Jewish communities. Against this backdrop, the recovery plan blueprint commits to \u201cfostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive creative sector.\u201d The DCLA has not yet responded to Hyperallergic\u2019s request for comment. The city\u2019s most ambitious plan for the arts in the blueprint is a 10-year initiative to build a cultural district on Governors Island, established in repurposed former military homes. The new complex will include exhibition spaces, offices, and will host an artist residency. The city is also poised to launch a \u201cGovernors Island Arts\u201d campaign, announcing upcoming art installations, cultural events, and programming starting this summer.The promised \u201cCulture at Risk\u201d response team will help arts organizations facing closure navigate government bureaucracy and secure financing assistance, according to the blueprint. The initiative is modeled on a similar program launched by the London City Hall in 2016 and expanded during the pandemic. In 202o, London City injected \u00a32.3 million\u00a0(~$3 million) into the program and has since saved hundreds of businesses and nonprofits from closing.   The blueprint also promises to reform the work of the DCLA\u2019s Cultural Development Fund (CDF), its major grantmaking program. This includes allowing multi-year funding for all grantees; efforts to diversify the panel review process; ensuring equity in CDF funding criteria; and \u201cexploring the possibility\u201d of allowing funds to be used for general operating expenses. If implemented, these strategies could help small and mid-size arts organizations in the city that have long struggled to gain access to city funding.Mayor Adams\u2019s preliminary budget will have to go through a series of hearings and discussions in the NYC Council before it\u2019s finally adopted in May or June.  \u201cEvery year, there\u2019s a budget dance, where the mayor\u2019s budget comes lower and city council puts money back in, and there\u2019s usually a dramatic swing from the preliminary budget to the adopted budget at the end of the budget negotiations,\u201d Dvorkin told Hyperallergic. \u201cBut this time around, it\u2019s not clear at all that the DCLA would escape some pretty serious cuts.\u201dJaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

They held placards that read \u201cGuarding the Guards\u201d \u2014 a rewording of the exhibition title Guarding the Art, curated by the museum\u2019s security guards and opening to press at the same time as their action. Other signs said \u201c1 Voice 1 Union,\u201d \u201cWall-to-Wall Union Election,\u201d and \u201cSign Our Union Election Agreement Now.\u201dThe workers\u2019 goal was to put pressure on museum Director Christopher Bedford to sign the City of Baltimore\u2019s union election agreement, which workers say he received two months ago. Without his signature, workers cannot vote to certify their union \u2014 which a petition on BMA Union\u2019s website claims a majority of eligible staff support. The hourlong demonstration was sandwiched into a packed day for the workers. Many of them had just come from a meeting with Bedford and Chief Operating Officer Christine Dietz, and some were headed back to the museum to work on a show curated by many of the same guards who are advocating for unionization. \u201cWe were trying to co-opt and piggyback on the media preview day for the Guarding the Art exhibition,\u201d Dereck Mangus, a security guard at the museum, told Hyperallergic. \u201cThe union has basically tried to put their money where their mouth is,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s like, all right \u2014 we agree with [the museum\u2019s] progressive vision and we acknowledge projects like\u00a0Guarding the Art\u00a0are in good faith, and a small step in the right direction. But we need to extend this to all departments, not just guards \u2014 and to have a union.\u201dThe meeting this morning followed a more adversarial all-staff email from Bedford sent on March 10, also posted on BMA\u2019s website, that indicated museum leadership was unwilling to conduct an election through the city because it vested too much authority in a third-party arbitrator. In that same email, Bedford also reportedly encouraged workers to consider conducting the union election through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). But that option is categorically unappealing to BAM staff because the NLRB retains a rule they consider antiquated, which would prevent the union from representing both security guards and the rest of the museum\u2019s workers. \u201cThe purpose of that email really was to cause confusion around this process,\u201d Kathleen Cancio, a spokesperson for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), told Hyperallergic. \u201cHow can you celebrate the security guards, but in the same breath, exclude them by suggesting this process?\u201d Cancio added that BMA workers were \u201creally happy \u2026 to get their messages across\u201d this morning, \u201cboth in their meeting with Bedford and publicly out in the open.\u201d An email from the union sent to leadership and the board trustees this afternoon, reviewed by Hyperallergic, said that Bedford expressed \u201csupport of guards and non-guards being in one unit\u201d during the meeting.The action today was the BMA Union\u2019s first physical demonstration since they first publicized their intention to form a union in September of last year, with the goals of improving job security, wages, accountability, and health and safety protections at the museum. Workers also cited their desire to be included in conversations around reopening during the pandemic and their interest in pushing the BMA to realize its own vision of becoming a more diverse and equitable institution \u2014 a promise made under Bedford\u2019s leadership in 2020, when he controversially proposed deaccessioning three major works in the museum\u2019s collection to fund equity initiatives.Within days of launching the campaign, the BMA Union won the support of a majority of museum workers. On October 5, a blog post on AFSCME\u2019s website formally announced the BMA Union\u2019s intention to unionize with AFSCME Council 67, the local Baltimore-based chapter of the largest trade union of public employees in the United States. The workers additionally officially requested a union election through the city of Baltimore in October.Mangus, who has written about museum unions and about his experience curating Guarding the Art for Hyperallergic, added that they \u201cgot close to meeting halfway\u201d with museum leadership during the talks today.But there is additional concern that museum leadership will drag their feet over the next few months given that Bedford will be leaving the BMA to assume the helm at the San Francisco Museum of Art (SFMOMA) \u2014 a unionized museum \u2014 in June. \u201cThey drag us along through these processes and stall, just to induce fear or even apathy,\u201d Mangus said. He cited efforts across town at the Walters Art Museum, which have also been stonewalled by similar tactics employed by museum leadership.When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the BMA sent Hyperallergic a link to the March 10 statement, which says that \u201ca city-run election, as was requested by BMA union organizers, is not a viable option.\u201d \u201cThe BMA\u2019s board and leadership will respect the outcome of a vote and will continue to work with staff toward greater equity, regardless of that outcome,\u201d the statement says.The opening of Guarding the Art provides a perfect backdrop for workers to distill the essence of their motivation to unionize \u2014 capturing in a nutshell both the unique opportunities they have, but also the challenges they continue to face, as staff members at purportedly progressive institutions desperate to prove their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Seventeen members of the BMA\u2019s security team co-curated the show, selecting works that were particularly meaningful to them. They will also participate in talks and Q&As in late April to discuss their work on the project.\u201cWe are de-privileging people who usually have the power like curators, and privileging people who don\u2019t have that kind of agency and power as guards,\u201d Rob Kempton, a security guard who was also a Guarding the Art curator, told Hyperallergic. \u201cIt\u2019s a very kaleidoscopic show. It is diverse in its offering, showcasing different art historical canons and time periods.\u201d Kempton added that he hoped this show would \u201cspark a torch\u201d at other museums.\u00a0Now that guards are questioning long unquestioned labor hierarchies at museums, obliterating the artificial divide between service and curatorial positions, they are seizing the moment to demand better labor conditions. \u201cWe want livable wages and to be able to live well. It\u2019s not that we aren\u2019t, but I find it hard to save \u2014 I\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Kempton said. \u201cI think our efforts are warranted, and we aren\u2019t going to go down without a fight.\u201dJaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

Maguire, an internationally renowned artist represented by galleries in New York City, Chicago, Dublin, and Paris, has worked closely with museum staff to put together this survey exhibition.Through painting, Maguire hopes to draw attention to marginalized voices and human rights atrocities on large canvases. \u201cThe goal of my work is public outrage,\u201d he said. Over the course of his career, he has spent time in Aleppo, Syria; Bentiu, South Sudan; S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico; Tucson, Arizona; and other locations. He visits and listens with families of displaced or missing peoples and works with professionals on the frontlines of these migratory and geopolitical issues, aiming to harness a journalist\u2019s attention to detail and humanity with his artistic talent during his travels.This exhibition unites several recent bodies of work. Maguire\u2019s techniques are striking, with the intention of evoking intense, almost visceral, responses in the viewer. Bombed-out buildings depicted in dripping paint characterize his Aleppo series from 2017. Additional paintings in the show reference immigration and refugee crises, border crossings, and drug wars in Mexico. Maguire tackles these profound issues with strokes of vibrant color. \u201cBrian\u2019s power as an artist is his ability to illuminate stories that otherwise go untold,\u201d said curator Brandon Reintjes.The exhibition includes loans from the Tia Collection in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Fergus McCaffrey Gallery in New York, New York; Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago, Illinois; Kerlin Gallery in Dublin, Ireland; and collectors Christian Groenke and Gulia Bruckmann.

Although these hopes proved false, these artists persevered in their studios and classes and continued to learn, expand, make, break, scream, cry, laugh, sigh, and wonder what it even means to make art in this moment. After the tumult and uncertainty of the past two years, they realize that they are re-entering a landscape that has fundamentally shifted.As their faculty, it has been an honor to be a part of their journey and privy to their individual stories. The works in this exhibition point to where each artist started nearly two years ago, to a point of arrival today, and to where they may be heading. The strength of their efforts suggests an overwhelming potential that fills us with hope.Learn more about Boston University School of Visual Arts and the 2022 MFA Thesis Exhibitions.Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center launches an international prize for the most innovative artists working in the spirit of BMC today.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

Some poorly drawn bodies, he wrote, \u201cseem a sack full of nuts rather than the surface of a human being.\u201d Happily, Flesh and Bones: The Art of Anatomy at the Getty Research Institute has selected the more accurate and exquisite anatomical illustrations from the 16th century onwards. The exhibition revivifies past views of bodies and provokes continued exploration of how we understand our human mechanics.Fittingly, the corporeal show opens with death. \u201cThe Living Dead,\u201d the first of six sections, explains how the visual tradition of the skeletal \u2018dance of death\u2019 reminded viewers of their mortality. This motif lingered in posed and animated anatomies of the early modern era, like a hunched, prayerful skeleton by Domenico Bonaveri. Other mesmerizing images include a woodcut illustrating nerves snaking away from a skeleton\u2019s bones as if electrified, and a depiction of the uncanny fetal assemblages of Cornelis Huyberts, who arranged infant skeletons around a stony landscape and originally included morbid captions about mortality.The era\u2019s new possibilities in printing and humanism spurred stronger interest in mapping the body, Monique Kornell, curator and author of the accompanying catalogue, explained to Hyperallergic in an interview. This change was embodied in Andreas Vesalius\u2019s seminal 1543 anatomical treatise De Corpus Fabrica Humani Libri Septum, colloquially known as De Fabrica, which included over 200 intricate anatomical woodcuts that differed from classical views of the body.The fascination with depicting the body and how it worked allowed physicians to better understand and heal it. A section on \u201cAnatomy for Artists\u201d explains how anatomy classes and dissections were incorporated into Renaissance artistic education. Partnerships between anatomists and artists, like the perfectionist Bernhard Siegfried Albinus and the imaginative Jan Wandelaar, generated prints of meticulous bodies set against vivid landscapes.\u201cAnatomy and the Antique\u201d shows how ancient statues were dissected in drawings; artists turned to classical works like the Apollo Belvedere as anatomical and artistic models. The show neatly reinforces these connections by placing a Roman torso from the Getty collection next to a woodcut from De Fabrica that illustrates abdominal organs spilling from a similar statue.Anatomical models depicted idealized bodies, with flaws smoothed out. The value placed on certain body types was reinforced in their images: the ideal figures of Apollo and Venus in Greco-Roman tradition, and Adam and Eve in Christianity, proliferated images of muscular men and fleshy, fertile women down the centuries. Although the drawings were meant to represent ideal humans, anatomists often sought or stole bodies for dissection that were deemed of less value, including those of people convicted of crimes. While the show touches on this complexity, it does not delve into pathological anatomy, drawings of bodies that deviated from the ideal based on shape or because of disease. It would be fascinating to see the topic addressed in a subsequent exhibition that builds from this foundation.The show\u2019s wealth of material leads visitors to consider the body on a number of levels, from a section on \u201cSurface Anatomy\u201d explaining how artists like Leonardo surmounted drawing the body to anatomical models with deeper dimensionality in \u201cSeeing in 3D.\u201d The thematic organization also intermixes a few contemporary works. OG Abel\u2019s 2012 \u201cLove and Hate\u201d evokes Dia de los Muertos makeup in counterpoint to the first section\u2019s representations of death, while Tavares Strachan\u2019s pulsating neon skeleton \u201cRobert\u201d (2018) memorializes the first Black American astronaut, Robert Lawrence, in the final section of the show. They are stirring works, though more context may have helped them feel as cohesive as the rigorous research in the rest the show.\u201cEverybody\u2019s interested in their body,\u201d Kornell said. Getting \u201cinside the body tells who we are, how we work, [and] how we\u2019ve figured that out over the centuries.\u201d Even today, when imaging technology can provide all kinds of anatomical illumination, illustrations still provide useful ways of slicing and dicing (so to speak) to clarify the body\u2019s relevant details. As the show reveals, art translates the complexity of the body to make legible whichever aspects of it we most need to understand.Flesh and Bones: The Art of Anatomy continues at the Getty Research Institute (200 Getty Center Dr #1100, Brentwood, Los Angeles) through July 10.

The resulting 30-minute video, On Necessary Work (2021), is part of Husni Bey\u2019s exhibition, These Conditions, currently at the Annex at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Coney Island, presented by the Vera List Center for Art and Politics, as part of the artist\u2019s two-year fellowship project, The School of Pandemics. Curated by Eriola Pira and Carin Kuoni, the show also includes a sound installation, a room filled with work centered on the AIDS crisis, another room remade as a domestic space, a two-month-long political-theater workshop with necessary workers, and live performances.The Annex was eerily quiet the day I visited. Without realizing that it had been built as a supply base during the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the emptiness of the exposed-concrete basement nevertheless struck in me an unsettling chord, offset by a beatific light streaming through windows \u2014 a fitting contrast, since the show itself pairs the resurgence and persistence of grief and trauma with a yearning to find commonality in pain, and to move not past but through it.\u00a0Some of the issues the nurses raised rang familiar from news coverage over the past two years: stories of loneliness, numbing daily routines, a corporate takeover of public health, and pressures to cut costs, which left hospital workers toiling beyond the already inhumane hours \u2014 as one nurse put it in the video, it felt as if working in urgent care were like \u201cflipping burgers.\u201d All workshop participants were women, so their complaint that hospital workers are \u201cthe lowest of the lowest rung\u201d in healthcare had an acute sting of institutional gender bias. The women found a visual-spatial metaphor to express the absurd dissonance between being the desperately needed \u201cessential\u201d workers, yet seeing their work devalued: A hand enters the frame before the camera and yanks an item from a stack of objects, causing its collapse.Husni Bey\u2019s art-political environment evokes an echo chamber, especially striking since so much of what it reverberates is the anguish of silence and absence. The artist herself suggests this idea in the video, when she tells the nurses that their conversations \u2014 and the videos they shared \u2014 made her think of \u201ca kind of ghost.\u201d She follows her comment with extreme close-ups split across three screens of a nurse\u2019s uniform, the camera slowly traveling up until it zooms out, in a framing that suggests depersonalization, but also a pervasive, disembodied haunting. Maybe the challenge then is not to exorcise the ghost \u2014 as we might rush to do after a trauma \u2014 but to find metaphors and tangible manifestations that capture its collective \u201csilent roar.\u201d\u00a0The impact of the show hinges on sensory deprivation not as a hindrance but as a pathway to restoration, starting with the space\u2019s austerity, which suggests a kind of ante-room of feeling \u2014 or so it seemed to me as I wandered into the \u201cliving room,\u201d delineated by plywood walls. The spare space contained a sofa, a table, a locker, and a few drawings in childlike hand. Rather than something to look at, it struck me as a holding place. (I later learned from Husni Bey that two workshop participants conceived it to recreate their own environments.) Nevertheless, having recently lost my father to COVID-19, I felt a peculiar ownership of it, and a tug of disquiet.\u00a0The phrase \u201csilent roar\u201d comes from a violinist in Husni Bey\u2019s sound work in five movements, Cronaca del Tempo Ripetuto (A chronicle of histories repeating, 2021) \u2014 five improvisations, in collaboration with Chamber Orchestra of Radicondoli, Tuscany, and the participation of Rab\u00e8l Theatrical Association, in response to pandemic lockdown \u2014 also featured in the show. In the accompanying libretto, the artist cites a book by the Italian writer Constantino Antichi, which describes gravediggers during the 1631-33 plague in Italy carrying bodies on stretchers, to avoid carts rattling on cobblestones \u2014 eliminating sound to counter fear. As an antidote to this silencing, Husni-Bey reinstates the deliberately staggered, piercingly solitary notes.Husni Bey\u2019s varied approaches make it harder to define her aims \u2014 what we often call the \u201cpay-off,\u201d following capitalist terminology \u2014 but her work does address the need for \u201crecovery.\u201d In the video, Cady Chaplin, a nurse from Chicago, speaks of crying when a coworker held her, as she suddenly realized she hadn\u2019t been touched in months. But the video\u2019s formal devices \u2014 a split screen, a multiplicity of windows \u2014 leaves open the question of whether or not Zooming provides a sense of connection. There was more closeness in the live performance\u2019s dedicated close-eyed movement exploration, by the group Duvet. In the two parts I saw, a dancer first moved about the space blindfolded, while an accompanying guide prevented him from bumping into walls; then two female dancers performed, and at one point became entangled in each other\u2019s arms. Body as armor, as protector, as a \u201cnurse,\u201d came to my mind, while in the adjacent space \u2014 another plywood room \u2014 The Ashes Action (DIVA TV, 1992), a video documenting an ACT UP! protest, showed gay men locking arms in a body wall, to prevent the police from picking them out, one by one.\u00a0The ACT UP! video was the one element in the show that directly reflected Husni Bey\u2019s interest in social movements, and specifically social change, in the wake of crises. (Although one might ask what exactly has changed in public response to them \u2014 if anything, the show\u2019s historical timeline stresses a tragic recurrence, with public health in the grip of pharmaceutical lobbies and profiteers, rather than undergoing a meaningful labor reform or empathic evolution.) In this sense, the show\u2019s current configuration doesn\u2019t yet fully delve into the sociopolitical dimension of Husni Bey\u2019s practice. It may in the future, when she presents the video she\u2019s currently making of the political-theater workshop, conducted in the space with a small group of necessary workers (it\u2019s slated to premiere at the New School in the fall of 2022, and then at Castello di Rivoli in Turin, Italy). As she described it to me, it reflects her research on past pandemics and the workers\u2019 experiences. What\u2019s already clear, though, is the ambition of Husni Bey\u2019s multivalent practice. It pushes art to be more than an exercise in spectatorship. Even if I\u2019m not sure how sounds and other metaphors for the pandemic (all of which we so urgently need to survive it) may become a platform for broader social change, These Conditions nevertheless resonates as a passionately pedagogic, interdisciplinary laboratory for communal knowledge.These Conditions continues at the Annex at the Brooklyn Army Terminal (80 58th St, Sunset Park, Brooklyn) through April 8.

Claus Elholm Andersen, who is finishing up a book on Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd, recently appeared on the High Theory podcast, where he shared his opinion that when society is confronted with the idea that it is based on fictions (as seen in the wake of the financial crisis), people then turn to fiction as a means of telling the truth. With his newest film, Ahed\u2019s Knee, Israeli director Nadav Lapid explores such themes through a heavily autobiographical story about personal tragedy and state censorship.\u00a0The title refers to Ahed Tamimi, a young Palestinian activist who made international headlines after a video of her slapping Israeli soldiers went viral. The lead character, a director known only as \u201cY.\u201d (Avshalom Pollak) wants to use cinema to expose the continued lies and illusions Israel has built its statehood upon. The story opens with Y. auditioning actresses for the role of Ahed, who is to be the subject of his next work. With an editing style reminiscent of late \u201960s Godard, Ahed\u2019s Knee deconstructs the boundaries between bodies, temporalities, and spaces as part of a polemic against Israeli state censorship. The film is structured visually around placid suburbs that feel alien in the desert. Y. is taking a break from production on his movie about Tamimi to present a screening of a previous work at a small-town library. But a few hours before, Yohalom (Nur Fibak), a friendly young Ministry of Culture worker, hands him a form outlining which topics he\u2019s allowed to discuss at the post-screening Q&A. If he doesn\u2019t uphold the agreement, he won\u2019t be paid. Y. decides to leverage his position to expose the Ministry for its censorship, even if doing so ruins Yohalom\u2019s career.Ahed\u2019s Knee explores the complexity of how \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cnice\u201d people often find themselves as the face of oppression. Y. likes Yohalom; they flirt and discuss art. He understands that she\u2019s well-intentioned and doesn\u2019t like what she\u2019s asking him to do. On the other hand, he\u2019s curt and aloof, cold and snobbish. His sexual appetites are ravenous, often uncaring. He\u2019s internalized his disgust with Israeli society by becoming almost monstrous himself, particularly after the recent loss of his mother. He\u2019s torn over his conviction to violate his contract because Yohalom is a cog in a system, and it\u2019s unclear whether taking a political stand will even do anything beyond further strain his relationship with state arts funding and take away her future. The story is a battleground of moral debate. Lapid doesn\u2019t waver on the idea that Israel is an oppressor \u2014 the question is instead what constitutes the best, most ethical way to fight the system, and what it means to be a product of such an environment.\u00a0Y. is the latest in a series of similar \u201cY\u201ds and Yoavs present in nearly every one of Lapid\u2019s films, each of whom are fictional stand-ins for an artist grappling with his identity. The Yoav of his previous movie, 2019\u2019s Synonyms, immigrates from Israel to France and refuses to speak Hebrew in an attempt to distance himself from militarization and state violence. In contrast, this Y. has to grapple with the truth that \u201cgeography wins,\u201d and we can\u2019t escape our homelands. Both Y. and Lapid were born and raised in Tel Aviv. Besides Tamimi, a heavy inspiration was the \u201cLoyalty in Culture\u201d bill, which would have revoked government funding for any artist who would \u201ccontravene the principles of the state.\u201d And around that same time, Lapid\u2019s own mother died. The story is based directly on an experience Lapid had showing his film The Kindergarten Teacher in a small town. Much as Andersen argues, Lapid\u2019s engagement with autofiction seems born from disillusionment. His repeated insertion of himself into these works becomes a study in a man whose identity is tied so closely to a society built on oppression.\u00a0Ahed\u2019s Knee thus acts like an exorcism, a reckoning with political obligation and what it means to be good on a social versus an interpersonal level. The unmade film within a film about Ahed Tamimi becomes commentary on how artists can use the stories of others to evade true self-reflection. In contrast to Synonyms, this is a story about someone who has stopped running from their past. Ahed Tamimi\u2019s story does not belong to Lapid, but the responsibility of dismantling Israel\u2019s oppression of Palestinians does not lie only with Palestinians.Ahed\u2019s Knee is now playing in select theaters.Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

Almost 40 years after their last music release, ABBA announced in September 2021 that they would begin \u201cperforming\u201d again as digital avatars called ABBAtars. The ABBAtars, created from filming the four singers of ABBA in motion capture over eight weeks, de-ages the pop group to their 1979 selves in order to \u201cperform at [their] very best,\u201d according to the band\u2019s website. London audiences are invited to see ABBA in their glory, in a concert that would never have existed during their heyday.This turn towards digital performance is not wholly new in the music industry, where deceased musicians like Tupac Shakur and Michael Jackson have both become projected figures in guest appearances at music festivals and award shows.It is also not new in the field of museums, where the Illinois Holocaust Museum has had holograms of Holocaust survivors relating their testimony since 2017 through the Survivor Stories Experience exhibit.Fearing that the loss of physical dialogue will remove the critical work of remembering past atrocities, the holograms at the Illinois Holocaust Museum are intended to preserve the testimony and memory of survivors. Both the ABBAtars and the Holocaust survivor holograms attempt to recreate presence. The existence of these types of performance requires us as audience members to consider what digital representations, from musical acts to the sharing of testimonials, can actually provide when it comes to engaging with the past.The motion capture of ABBA for concert performances and the Holocaust survivor holograms have different aims, but their use of curation, reinterpretation, and technology make them intriguing examples of this phenomenon. The ABBAtars are creating, per the band\u2019s own language, \u201cthe concert [they\u2019ve] always wanted you to have.\u201d This concert was not one ABBA would have performed in 1979, not only because they won\u2019t be physically present, but also because they can perform songs from their new album Voyage (2021) as their 1979 digitized selves. The singers, now in their 70s, can have their performances live on for fans who were not born during their peak of success, and they can do so while explicitly making the type of presentation they want their audiences to see. The past is in the present, even when it should be impossible.The holograms of Holocaust survivors at the Illinois Holocaust Museum, on the other hand, demonstrate what happens when digitized performance is based in audience interaction. In participating in the Survivor Stories Experience, audience members can ask questions of the hologram they choose. Mediated by a docent, the voice recognition software allows a visitor to get an answer from a hologram, and selects for the visitors what stories they may hear from Holocaust survivors who agreed to be rendered in such a way. Unlike how the ABBAtars are purported to function, these holograms are in some way reactive to the people who come to see them. The testimony they bring forth is limited by what was filmed and collected, but it nevertheless captures some of the memories of survivors before they pass away.Holograms, however, cannot fully recreate flesh and blood live performance or testimony, and what they offer only reminds us that these types of audience interaction cannot fully animate the past. When I visited the Illinois Holocaust Museum in 2018, the survivor I \u201cspoke\u201d to, Aaron Elster, had recently passed away and the museum was showing his testimony as tribute to his life and work. It was all too clear, sitting in the auditorium, that I was watching not the man, but his recorded memories about his trauma. While this fact did not diminish the power of his testimony, I knew that the hologram could not match the physical man digitally rendered in front of me. It is a blessing to have the technology (from the USC Shoah Foundation) to have Elster\u2019s testimony in such a captivating way, but it cannot bridge the loss of him fully.The ABBAtars will likely be confronted with a similar phenomenon when they debut this May. A digitized version of ABBA will certainly be a sight to behold and will most likely create the party that the band is hoping for over seven months in London. But they, and any digitally rendered performance of this ilk, cannot hope to capture the past in the ways that they may wish to. What they can offer, though, is a very different way for audiences to engage with the past that can supplement all the other avenues we already know.Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

Each square canvas in the series measures 40 by 40 inches, with identical facial outlines and backgrounds painted variously red, orange, light blue, and sage blue. After the actress died from a drug overdose that was ceaselessly sensationalized in the media, Monroe became one of Warhol\u2019s favorite subjects throughout the 1960s, with all of his paintings of her using the same Niagara (1953) publicity photo. Examples hang in some of the most prestigious institutions in the world, including the Tate in London and the Cleveland Museum of Art.\u00a0The Shot Marilyns got their name when performance artist and friend-of-a-friend Dorothy Podber visited Warhol at his New York studio, which he called the Factory. Noticing a stack of freshly-painted works, Podber asked Warhol if she could shoot them. Warhol, assuming that she was asking for permission to photograph them, said yes, before Podber drew out a revolver and shot a bullet through the foreheads of the Marilyns. A few years later, Valerie Solanas would shoot and nearly kill Warhol at the Factory, imbuing the paintings\u2019 scars with additional significance.Christie\u2019s will be auctioning the work in a philanthropic sale to benefit the new Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation Z\u00fcrich, which a press release describes as \u201cdedicated to improving the lives of children the world over by establishing support systems centered on providing healthcare and educational programs.\u201d The Ammanns were siblings and ran a gallery in Z\u00fcrich beginning in the late 1970s, dealing in works spanning the Impressionist period to contemporary art. Doris headed the gallery until last year, when she died at the age of 76.Hyperallergic has contacted Christie\u2019s and Thomas Ammann Fine Art to request additional details on the Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation. Fortune reports that the foundation has committed to funding children\u2019s health and education causes for the next three to six years and will be funded in part by the sale of the portrait.Georg Frei, chairman of the board of the foundation and partner of the late Doris Ammann, said in a statement that the painting \u201cisolates the person and the star: Marilyn the woman is gone; the terrible circumstances of her life and death are forgotten.\u201d He compared Monroe\u2019s smile to that of the Mona Lisa, echoing a parallel drawn by Alex Rotter, Christie\u2019s chairman of 20th- and 21st-century art. Calling the work \u201cthe absolute pinnacle of American Pop and the promise of the American Dream,\u201d Rotter indicated that it stands beside Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus,\u201d Da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d and Picasso\u2019s \u201cLes Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d as one of the \u201cgreatest paintings of all time.\u201dThe sale in May will also test the current valuation of Warhol\u2019s masterpieces. Last fall, Sotheby\u2019s sold \u201cNine Marilyns,\u201d a nearly seven-foot-tall, black-and-white silkscreen from 1962, for $47.4 million. Sotheby\u2019s also sold Warhol\u2019s most expensive work to date, \u201cSilver Car Crash (Double Disaster)\u201d (1963), which fetched $105.4 million in 2013. According to Bloomberg, works by Warhol have sold privately for over $100 million.\u201cShot Sage Blue Marilyn\u201d is distinguished by the method Warhol used to produce it \u2014 a more detailed and demanding technique that he developed in 1964 and used very sparingly because it was so involved. He abandoned that process after creating a small number of the Marilyn portraits, according to Christie\u2019s press release. The most recent sale of a work from the Shot Marilyn series occurred in 2007, when hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner Steven Cohen purchased the turquoise one in 2007 for $80 million. The two other canvases in the group belong to publisher Peter Brant \u2014\u00a0who purchased the light blue canvas for a mere $5,000 in 1967 \u2014\u00a0and shipping heir Philip Niarchos \u2014 who bought the red one for $3.6 million in 1994.

COVID-19\u2019s impact on the arts has been undeniable, but new data released last week by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) quantifies the extent of the damage: Between 2019 and 2020, the arts economy shrank at nearly twice the rate of the US economy as a whole.\u00a0The arts represent a broad and varied sector of local, institutional, and national organizations, and the majority of artists working in the US are either self-employed or independently contracted. The NEA says that arts and cultural production fell by 6.4% when adjusted for inflation, compared to a 3.4% decline in the economy overall. The value added by self-employed artists, writers, and performers fell by 20.6%, and, according to the NEA\u2019s analysis, the unemployment rate across arts and culture industries shot up from 3.7% in 2019 to 10.3% in 2020.The NEA reports that while arts and cultural industries regained some ground during 2021, they have not yet returned to 2019 income and activity levels. Several independently owned arts and cultural spaces that initially closed in 2020 never reopened their doors after suffering irremediable economic losses, and others held on by a thread of support from government subsidies and community aid.With theaters and live performance spaces shuttered for nearly a year, the film and performing arts industries were predictably among the hardest hit. The film industry lost approximately 136,000 workers when COVID-19 halted all production, and while many studios have since resumed in-person work, many safety protocols have persisted.\u00a0Government arts and cultural contributions remained steady during the pandemic. Despite reduced production, arts and culture managed to add $876.7 billion to the national GDP in 2020, down from $919.7 billion in 2019. The findings also highlight that third quarter performing arts revenue doubled from $834 million in 2020 to $1.7 billion in 2021, yet that amount lags behind the $12.7 billion earned in 2019.\u201cWhile arts and cultural industries and workers nationwide have sustained heavy losses, the sector continues to play an outsized role in the U.S. economy \u2014 as the new data demonstrate,\u201d NEA Chair Dr. Maria Rosario Jackson said in a statement.\u00a0Rosario Jackson points to an interesting trend within the sector: That summer of self-isolation and the onset of remote work catalyzed a mass transition to digital arts programming. Gallery openings and live performances, which were once strictly in-person affairs, could be accessed from the comfort of one\u2019s home, and this proliferation of digital media engagement increased economic value by 14.3% between 2019 and 2020, employing 12,000 salaried workers.\u00a0The Arts and Cultural Production Satellite Account (ACPSA) compiled data fact sheets illustrating the value that the arts and culture sector added to local economies across the 50 states in 2020. In New York alone, the arts contributed $126.7 billion, which amounts to 7.3% of the state\u2019s overall economic value, and independent artists supplied approximately $5 million overall. While COVID-19\u2019s toll on the creative economy has been significant, for the NEA, sustained value added is a clear indicator of progress and a reason to advocate for greater support of the creative sector.\u00a0\u201cThe NEA is committed to participating as a key partner in the recovery of this sector, recognizing not only its economic value, but also the arts\u2019 capacity to transform the lives of individuals and communities in other ways, contributing to health and well-being, and overall resilience,\u201d Rosario Jackson added.\u00a0Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

People from across the international spectrum, from politicians to poets, are speaking out and sending aid as Ukrainians experience devastating Russian airstrikes on children\u2019s hospitals, maternity wards, and most recently an art school sheltering some 400 individuals in the port city of Mariupol. At least 2,300 people have died in Mariupol alone, and those still alive are facing shortages of food, water, and electricity as invading forces hold the city under siege.The situation has inspired many artists and cultural institutions to agitate for change and raise funds for war relief. Among them is performance artist Marina Abramovi\u0107, who will restage one of her most famous works in support of a crisis that is both universally and personally upsetting for her.\u201cI really hurt,\u201d Abramovi\u0107 said in an interview with W Magazine. \u201cIt hurts so much because war hurts in general.\u201d But for the Yugoslavian-born artist (now Serbia), whose work draws from strong connections to her Eastern European origins, this conflict strikes close to home.\u201cI have full solidarity with [the Ukrainian people] on this impossible day,\u201d Abramovi\u0107 said in a video statement following the declaration of war by Russia on February 24. \u201cAn attack on Ukraine is an attack on all of us. It\u2019s an attack on humanity and has to be stopped.\u201dIn a further demonstration of her support, Abramovi\u0107 has partnered with New York\u2019s Sean Kelly Gallery and Artsy to offer a performance art meet-and-greet \u2026 or at least meet-and-silently-stare. Through March 25, interested parties can bid on one of two opportunities for a limited restaging of Abramovi\u0107\u2019s epic performance The Artist Is Present, which took place over the course of almost three months at the Museum of Modern Art in 2010. An encounter for a single person and a second encounter for two people will be captured by photographer Marco Anelli, who documented almost all of the 1,500 participants in the original performance \u2014 an attendance roster that included celebrities such as Lou Reed and Bj\u00f6rk, and, famously, an emotional reunion with the artist\u2019s ex, Ulay. All the proceeds of the unconventional fundraiser will go to Direct Relief, which is working with Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Health to provide urgent medical assistance as well as long-term aid to the many lives devastated by the war. Bidding will likely be lively for such a unique opportunity in service of a greater good. Both the single- and two-person experiences have now met their reserve price, surpassing the $10,000 and $15,000 mark, respectively. Abramovi\u0107 has not staged a work in New York for seven years, but in October of 2021, the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv unveiled Abramovi\u0107\u2019s \u201cCrystal Wall of Crying,\u201d an interactive \u201cwall of healing\u201d that commemorates the Jews killed in Ukraine\u2019s capital during one of the biggest massacres of the Holocaust. It is poignant that a place where the artist sought to bring healing is suffering a new tragedy, and it makes sense that Abramovi\u0107, who has made a career of transforming pain into redemption, wants to do her part.

It would have limited \u201cproof of work\u201d (PoW), an energy-extensive consensus mechanism that employs large amounts of CO2-emitting computational power and is used in popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as in the minting of many non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The parliamentary vote on MiCA and the quashing of the PoW provision coincide with a moment in which cryptocurrency advocates are on the defensive in response to United States and European lawmakers\u2019 warnings that Russian oligarchs may capitalize on cryptocurrency to circumvent sanctions.The decision on the PoW provision, which was defeated with a 30-23 vote with six abstentions, has been described as a major victory for the crypto industry and its advocates, who feared that the MiCA provision would hinder innovation. Three days before the vote, French politician Pierre Person tweeted: \u201cBy banning Bitcoin and Ether, by complicating the use of NFT and DeFi, the European Parliament is mortgaging our monetary and financial sovereignty.\u201d In a Twitter thread on the defeat of the provision, Patrick Hansen, head of strategy at the crypto start-up Unstoppable Finance, described the vote as a \u201cbig relief & political success for the bitcoin & crypto currency in the EU,\u201d adding that \u201cthe crypto community in the EU has clearly become a political force!\u201dBREAKING: The ECON committee of the EU Parliament just voted against the de-facto POW-ban: 32 against, 24 in favor.Big relief & political success for the bitcoin & crypto community in the EU\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaaWill share a breakdown of the vote and what\u2019s next here in this thread. #BitcoinThe ample carbon footprint of PoW consensus mechanisms \u2014  a study by the University of Cambridge put Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption on par with that of a small country \u2014 has come under increasing scrutiny. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, the blockchain on which most NFTs are minted, uses PoW, though it has committed to eventually migrating to an alternative, more energy-efficient consensus mechanism called \u201cproof of stake.\u201d According to calculations by artist Memo Akten, the minting of an NFT currently uses an average of 142 kilowatt-hours\u00a0(kWh) of energy, creating 83 kilograms of CO2; factor in bids, sales, and ownership transfers, and those numbers balloon even further. Atken calculated that the footprint of the average NFT on a marketplace like SuperRare \u201cis equivalent to a EU resident\u2019s total electric power consumption for more than a month, with emissions equivalent to driving for 1000 Km, or flying for 2 hours.\u201d\u201cRight now PoW accounts for similar emissions as all private jet flights,\u201d artist Kyle McDonald, whose work has explored the environmental cost of crypto, told Hyperallergic. \u201cEthereum energy use alone is larger than that of Facebook and Google, combined. And NFTs make up\u00a0around 10-20% of all activity on Ethereum. If PoW NFTs led to an overall emissions reduction for the arts, it would be harder to criticize. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m seeing right now.\u201dMcDonald, who pointed out that the policies in MiCA were most pertinent to Bitcoin, added: \u201cIf cryptocurrencies can\u2019t meet \u2018minimum environmental sustainability standards,\u2019 we need to ditch them. And if our representatives can\u2019t protect us from environmental\u00a0destruction, we need to ditch them too. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see more direct action, like\u00a0vandalism of mining facilities. Especially in the US, where miners are regularly re-opening abandoned natural gas wells and coal plants.\u201dDr. Tina Rivers Ryan, an art historian and curator at Albright-Knox Museum who has written extensively about NFTs, believes that artists and collectors should ask themselves what the potential costs \u2014 environmental and otherwise \u2014 of transacting with a particular blockchain might be, and whether the benefits outweigh them.\u201cFor some, the answer is: no blockchain is worth it. (It\u2019s still entirely possible to sell digital art using just a sales agreement and a credit card.) Others are happy to work with the PoW blockchain Ethereum because of its historical role in the development of NFTs and the wealth that is currently stored in it,\u201d Ryan said in an email to Hyperallergic. \u201cMost digital artists I know fall in the middle, choosing to mint with a PoS blockchain like Tezos, where the average sales are lower, but so is the energy consumption.\u201dOf the removal of the PoW provision, Jess Northend, policy lead of the Science and Innovation Unit at the nonprofit Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, told Hyperallergic that regulators should address crypto\u2019s environmental impact \u201cwithout stifling innovation.\u201d\u201cThe amendment voted down this week would simply have shifted the use of Proof of Work elsewhere and likely had a range of unintended consequences, undermining the EU\u2019s burgeoning crypto market,\u201d Northend said. \u201cPolicy makers should instead support the use of Proof of Stake wherever possible, alongside renewable energy for mining, nudging the market towards less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms.\u201dFurther efforts to mitigate crypto\u2019s substantial carbon footprint in Europe is in the cards: A parliamentary majority voted to pursue alternative legislation that would include crypto assets in the EU\u2019s sustainable finance taxonomy, which would make it more difficult for mining companies to get funding but would not be as limiting as the MiCA provision.Speaking of behalf of the Socialists and Democrats, who abstained from the vote, Finnish Member of Parliament Eero Hein\u00e4luoma expressed disappointment over the results of the vote. \u201cIf we don\u2019t curtail this massive carbon footprint by putting crypto-currencies on a more sustainable path, our efforts to combat the climate crisis and boost our energy independence risk being in vain,\u201d he said in a statement.Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

The show is curated by Dr. Petrina Dacres and opens on Thursday, March 24, 2022, with a reception from 6 to 8pm.Originally from Jamaica, Sharon Norwood migrated to Canada as a child. She creates works that exploit the decorative intentions and joy of mark-making and gesturing, disrupt the White gaze and other passive notions of viewing \u201cthe other,\u201d and question standing narratives and systems that shape how identities are understood.Drawing inspiration from the shape of Black hair, the starting point of Norwood\u2019s work is often a curly line. In her abstract prints and paintings, she intertwines organic lines to act as gestural markings; in her ceramic sculptures and installations, the curly line surfaces in interwoven geometric shapes. Norwood\u2019s formal gestures symbolically reference the Black body and its relationship to politics of labor, beauty, and race.Dr. Petrina Dacres is ISCP\u2019s 2022 Jane Farver Memorial Fund resident.

This wasn\u2019t because of the artwork itself, which she proclaimed \u201ccool and ugly at the same time.\u201d It was because answering my question about what she thought of the work caused her to loosen her grasp on the balloon she was bringing home from a kindergarten classmate\u2019s birthday party.\u00a0Hayden has fashioned a hundred school desks from cedar logs salvaged from the New Jersey Pine Barrens and installed them in four groups spread across the park\u2019s lawns. Spiny branches emerge from their seats and desktops, splaying off in all directions. I wanted to ask my children what they thought about the work because Hayden has explained that Brier Patch comments on education.\u00a0The title refers to folktales about a wily rabbit who begs the fox who has captured him not to throw him into a nearby patch of thorny brambles. (In America, the folktales were most famously reincarnated in the \u201cUncle Remus\u201d stories about Br\u2019er Rabbit.) The angry fox, wishing to torment his victim, hurls him into the thorns \u2026 only for the rabbit to escape, since he knows how to navigate the seemingly impenetrable pathways through the patch.As my daughter sobbed, my seven-year-old son delivered his opinion. He couldn\u2019t tell whether the work was ugly or beautiful, happy or sad. He would only say that it made him feel confused. Frustrated, I gave up on our cultural outing and delivered on the milkshakes I had promised from the in-park Shake Shack.\u00a0Back home, reading Hayden\u2019s interview with the New York Times, I realized my son was not so obtuse after all. Hayden said that Brier Patch\u2019s branches could symbolize the barriers to education often present in the United States. On the other hand, he claims that the work can also symbolize that same system\u2019s benefits. No one could sit on these seats, but they might imagine themselves finding a creative perch on the branches, sheltering within the system. The work can be seen as a critique or a celebration \u2014 or both \u2014 depending on the visitor\u2019s frame of reference.Confusing, indeed. Or perhaps a better word might be evasive \u2014 Hayden escapes being pinned down by an interpretation just as surely as Br\u2019er Rabbit escaped Br\u2019er Fox.The one thing Brier Patch is not is a brier patch. The work originated as an installation of six desks at White Columns in 2018. There, the desks were pushed close enough together that their branches intertwined, creating a thicket in the gallery. But the desks in the park sit in widely spaced aisles. The tips of their branches brush up against each other overhead, like enclosed bowers arching over walks in a genteel garden. Nothing would prevent you from moving easily between the desks.One of the four groups of desks is branch-free. In the middle of the dense text on the park\u2019s signage about the piece, a sentence notes that Hayden \u201coffers\u201d these desks to \u201cindividuals and groups to interact with the piece for contemplation or convening.\u201d I haven\u2019t yet seen anyone take up this offer, perhaps because these desks are surrounded by a fence \u2014 a low one, to be sure, but still a barrier. The soft, bright cedar desktops, ripe for doodling or carving, or even staining with Shake Shack ketchup, remain unscathed, more than a month into the installation\u2019s January to May run.The Madison Square Park Conservancy, the nonprofit that manages the park through a public-private partnership, takes similar care of the space\u2019s other features. Its Shake Shack, the chain\u2019s founding location and a crucial partner in the park\u2019s finances, bustles tidily. Parents, whether of dogs or children, have nothing to complain about in the park\u2019s runs and playground. Even pollinators are provided for, with five bee homes scattered amid the greenery. Meanwhile, unhoused people, at-risk youth, protestors, and hustlers have somehow been encouraged to stay six blocks south, in Union Square Park.The Madison Square Park Conservancy has been commissioning temporary art installations for the park since 2004. The signs for Brier Patch describe \u201cthe diverse range\u201d of the program\u2019s artists, while informing us that the work draws from Hayden\u2019s \u201cexperience as an American and African American.\u201d Within the well-patrolled boundaries of the park, where you are never far from a delicately worded fundraising appeal, it\u2019s hard not to see Brier Patch as just another amenity, offering a pleasant opportunity for virtue signaling.\u00a0Many of Hayden\u2019s other works, which also make surreal modifications to everyday objects, have much more bite. His American Hero series, which began in 2010 with a taxidermized buffalo mount given cornrows, points out the concealment of Black contributions to foundational American history. A sculpture of a police car draped in a white sheet, 2021\u2019s \u201cBoogey Man,\u201d denounces the white supremacist ideals that underlie police brutality. And Hayden has taken meaningful steps to help others enter the brier patch of the art world, for example by donating works to raise funds for tuition for Black MFA and art history students and persuading the Public Art Fund to expand what had been a solo commission into a group show for other young artists of color.But in the wealthy bubble of Madison Square Park, Brier Patch allows viewers to pat themselves on the back for their mere awareness of inequalities in our educational systems. The parents walking past who send their children to private schools are not made to question their decisions. The nannies whose own children are in sub-par public schools are not encouraged to protest that inequality. Everyone just gets to take nice Instagram photos, since the work does indeed, as my daughter said, look cool.\u00a0Brier Patch is a temporary outdoor installation, not a public monument, and so I won\u2019t judge it as one. But, as we debate what kinds of new monuments should be built to symbolize our changing understanding of our country, it can serve as a reminder to ask about who is paying. If a monument is seen as an amenity, it is likely to turn into something pleasing to the most influential and deep-pocketed members of a community, regardless of an artist\u2019s intent.\u00a0Hugh Hayden: Brier Patch continues at Madison Square Park (Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue between 23rd Street and 26th Street, Flatiron and NoMad, Manhattan) through May 1.

Given at CUNY in 2018, the poet-classicist\u2019s talk floatily triangulated between the introduction of a third actor in Sophoclean plays (corners move narrative forward), her father\u2019s inability to orient himself amid mounting dementia (corners help us locate ourselves), and the corner as a form beyond the dialectic of inside and outside, or shelter and threat (corners are spatially distinct and psychologically freighted). I was drawn to the idea of moving the corner to the center, of recasting a space typically viewed as dustily incidental as a fulcrum of action.The gravity that Carson ascribes to corners sprang to mind when I encountered \u201cCorner Basher\u201d (1988), the first work \u2014 before the check-in desk, even \u2014 in Los Angeles-based sculptor Liz Larner\u2019s most significant survey in more than 20 years, Liz Larner: Don\u2019t put it back like it was at SculptureCenter. Among the earliest of the 28 artworks on view, which span from 1987 to 2021, \u201cCorner Basher\u201d activates a space that is normally invisible. The kinetic sculpture, which resembles a treacherous tetherball set, features a steel pole with a dangling metal ball hooked up to an electric motor. By flipping a switch and rotating a dial on an adjacent column, visitors to the space \u2014 with varying degrees of aggression, glee, and bemusement \u2014 can set the piece in motion, causing it to repeatedly wallop the walls of the corner in which it stands, at a range of velocities. As more people operate the machine over the course of time, the wall increasingly, incrementally, and a bit bathetically, crumbles into pieces on the floor. Conceived as a sly rejoinder to the macho-coded destructive robots of Mark Pauline\u2019s performance collective Survival Research Laboratories, Larner\u2019s collaborative \u201cCorner Basher\u201d literally lays the museum\u2019s structure bare in a work of participatory institutional critique.In the nearby \u201cWrapped Corner\u201d (1991), gleaming chains, turnbuckles, and brackets are kinkily pulled tight around the corner edge of a room in horizontal rows; \u201cToo the Wall\u201d (1990) features six delicately jointed steel and silver armatures, each holding a pale square of leather, suspended across a corner in increasingly taut tiers. These site-responsive drawings in space highlight the physical and social context in which the art and the viewer are situated, and, particularly by centering the anti-heroic corner, pose questions about the values that are reflected in both our built environments and the ways in which we move through those environments (or, show art in them). The feminist thrust of this undertaking is made overt in \u201cBird in Space\u201d (1989): a reinterpretation of the (white, male) Romanian modernist Constantin Brancusi\u2019s famous 1923 sculpture of a bird in flight, a pedestal-mounted phallic abstraction made from marble or bronze. Larner\u2019s own abstract avian, its outstretched wings the size of the room, is constructed from bowed lengths of humble nylon cord held tensile between steel blocks. Slipping in and out of visibility based on the viewer\u2019s position, this sweeping anti-monument asks gallery-goers to recognize where they stand and what they notice: to engage in the relatively unpolished and unsexy, intermittently rewarding, ongoing project of parsing the artworks\u2019 nuances and thinking relationally.\u201cI like to think of the viewer as more of a sensor, a being using every sense to understand an object,\u201d said Larner in an interview with Mary Ceruti for the exhibition catalogue. Larner\u2019s varied work allows us to feel our way toward meaning, often physically moving in the process. It can be difficult to identify, as the artist put it in a recent interview with Jeffrey Kastner, a traditional \u201cthroughline\u201d in her oeuvre (despite the art historical record\u2019s repeated attempts to shoehorn her into post-minimalism). The pieces in the show are wildly disparate, ranging from abstract to figurative and from microscopic to massive, executed in media as diverse as false eyelashes, bronze, porcelain, leather, and steel. They reflect a body of work with a slippery habit of shapeshifting, characterized by a commitment to an active viewing experience and materiality itself, rather than any one material or aesthetic.Larner, who graduated from CalArts with a BFA in photography in 1985, found her way to sculpture organically, via bacterial cultures that she had been cultivating with nutrient agar in petri dishes. Though she initially produced these experiments to photograph them, the artist became interested in letting them unfold as process works in three-dimensional space, giving rise to the cleverly titled Cultures series (1987-ongoing). In \u201cOrchid, Buttermilk, Penny\u201d (1987), the titular items decompose \u2014 altering one another\u2019s chemical compositions in the process \u2014 in two petri dishes encased in glass atop a pedestal. \u201cPrimary, Secondary: Culture of Empire State Building and Twin Towers\u201d (1988), a landscape to the former still life, is an architectonic glass-and-aluminum display of two petri dishes with colorful, crispy material grown from cultures taken at those corporate, seemingly inorganic locations. Exploring representation on a literal, material level, these works set biochemical assemblages into motion, evincing Larner\u2019s early interest in sympoesis and an exploratory, collaborative approach to making that is also at the heart of \u201cCorner Basher.\u201dEncountering the solitary \u201csmile (after dark)\u201d (2009), a somewhat ominous, inky length of shiny porcelain upturned at the corners, conjures up Alice\u2019s wonderment: \u201cI\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u201d From 1996 to 2011, Larner labored on the smile series, a group of abstracted, disembodied grins made from casting foamcore forms in porcelain, a material also used in dental veneers. \u201csmile (after dark)\u201d is hollow, literally. Its unevenly faceted, intermittently lacerated surface makes it difficult to discern the inside from the outside (like a corner), prompting the viewer to scrutinize a detached gesture that is seen as shorthand for joy but so often contains grimacing gradations of ambivalence, obligation, resentment, or anger \u2014 perhaps particularly among people repeatedly told to smile.Larner, who lives and works in the birthplace of the anti-utilitarian California Clay Revolution, has since turned to the softer, more porous medium of ceramics, her focus throughout the past decade. Like the Cultures, ceramics inherently require the artist to cede a measure of authorship to nature and entropy: after the clay, teeming with microorganisms, is dug from the earth, worked, and shaped, it hardens into being in the kiln \u2014 cracking and warping as it sees fit \u2014 outside of the artist\u2019s sight and out of her hands. A sequence of large, wall-mounted ceramic lozenges, begun in 2013, line a lower-level hallway. Glazed or painted in arresting hues and titled after geological phenomena, they include \u201csubduction\u201d (2013), a deep, shifting well of indigo; \u201cinflexion\u201d (2013), a blue morpho butterfly\u2019s shimmering azure; and \u201cvi (calefaction)\u201d (2015), a navy ombre studded with chunky stones and minerals to a celestial effect. Alluding to the fault lines that run through fired clay and earth alike, each thick slab is intractably cracked, from hairline fissures and crumbling edges to clean rips down the middle, visual pauses that riff on Barnett Newman\u2019s zip paintings. The viewer slips, unsettled, between art historical time and geological time; micro and macro; chance and intention; nature and culture. Through a longstanding practice of regarding her materials and audience as her co-creators, and approaching sculpture as an open-ended experience of embodiment rather than a static or foreclosed object, Larner provokes us to repeatedly lose and locate ourselves in her work. The inner unsteadiness \u2014 the searching \u2014 that this push-and-pull sets in motion is the main event.Liz Larner: Don\u2019t put it back like it was continues at SculptureCenter (44-19 Purves St, Long Island City, Queens) through March 28 and will travel to the Walker Art Center (725 Vineland Place, Minneapolis, Minnesota) from April 30 to September 4.

The inaugural contemporary art fair, scheduled to take place this summer during the centennial Southwestern Association for Indian Arts\u2019s Santa Fe Indian Market, has been billed as the first of its kind in the world, where contemporary Indigenous fine art galleries will gather for four days in New Mexico\u2019s capital city. Martindale hopes to expand the Art Indigenous concept \u2014 which will feature sculpture, painting, photography, installation, and performance \u2014 to other cities.Martindale, who says that he produced the LA Art Show for a quarter-century, is a longtime worldwide art fair attendee. For years, the lack of global representation for contemporary Native American and First Nations artists nagged at him.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a show for contemporary artists from Indigenous lineage, and why don\u2019t we see more of that art at some of these major shows?\u201dAlong with The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s inclusion of Native American art, Martindale says another milestone took place when the Upper East Side institution hired Patricia Marroquin Norby (Pur\u00e9pecha) as its first full-time curator of Native American art.\u201cOne thing led to another and now there\u2019s a dialog in art museums saying that if you want to have a complete collection of American art, then you need Native American and Indigenous art in the US and Canada in your collection,\u201d says Martindale. \u201cI think this is all gelling together at this moment in time.\u201dThe idea for Art Indigenous Santa Fe took off due to the upcoming centennial anniversary of the Santa Fe Indian Market, which is scheduled to take place in an in-person format. The popular event, said to be North America\u2019s largest and most important juried Indigenous art market, is helmed by Native American woman Kim Peone (Colville Confederated Tribes and Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians). The market, which has drawn upwards of 150,000 visitors to New Mexico\u2019s capital city, features Native artists displaying and selling their works in and around the historic Santa Fe Plaza.Martindale was also encouraged to move forward after attending 2021 Art Basel Miami Beach in Florida. There, for the first time, he noticed that an installation and performance piece section of the fair included a Native American artist. \u201cI thought, \u2018Yes. Finally. It\u2019s happening,\u2019\u201d he says.A partial list of participating Art Indigenous Santa Fe galleries is expected to be announced in April 2022; Martindale says the full roster, which he anticipates will be in the range of 30 to 40 galleries, will drop in May. An Art Indigenous Santa Fe preview event is scheduled from 6 to 10 pm on Thursday, August 18 at El Museo de Cultural de Santa Fe at the Railyard Arts District, and the show will run through Sunday, August 21.\u201cWe\u2019re not taking away anything from Indian Market, but rather adding to Indian Market, and bringing in a whole other group of collectors that maybe wouldn\u2019t come to town for Indian Market,\u201d says Martindale. \u201cWith this gallery-oriented show, we\u2019re presenting these artists that have not participated in Indian Market for years or never have.\u201dJaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

It seems that a decade of protest, and the example of several other museums cutting ties with the company, hasn\u2019t changed anything \u2014 the museum is still performing gratitude to the oil giant for its generosity. There are so many things about the British Museum to criticize, but its complicity in BP\u2019s artwashing ranks alongside the museum\u2019s continual refusal to engage with its own colonial history and its total rejection of any requests for the repatriation of looted objects held in its collection. It\u2019s these issues, and the connections between them, that are most significant \u2014 two high-profile movements that challenge the way we engage with the British Museum and have consequences that can be felt beyond its walls.There is, broadly, a disconnect between these movements. There are plenty of organizers who move between both spaces, but the public coverage and popular response tends to separate them. Talking about BP leads to the allegation that you\u2019re ignoring the colonialist violence of the museum itself, while focusing on restitution is read as though you\u2019re not thinking about the environmental impact of oil companies.Even as anti-colonial consciousness grows and there is a greater public awareness and involvement in campaigns for restitution, there\u2019s a tendency to not see the modernity of this fight. It\u2019s still bleakly common, even among people who are engaged with these conversations, to see the act of colonialism as an element of the past, and its consequences in the present, but not to consider the ways that colonial exploitation is still active. The language used by museums, the way imperialism is neatly sectioned off into history, the way institutions work to perpetuate the myth that these communities have simply faded passively away, the euphemisms around acquisitions, add to the impression that the actual moment of violence is over. We\u2019re talking about the systematic displacement of communities from their homes, the destruction of cultural landscapes in the pursuit of profit, and the abuse of marginalized laborers to produce wealth in the cultural West. How can this be anything other than a continuation of colonialism?There is an incredible opportunity here for collaborations that can lead to real and meaningful change. In my own experience, it works both ways: People involved in climate justice campaigns are open to learning about the exclusionary history of these spaces, just as those who explore the racism and violence at a museum\u2019s heart are able to consider modern forms of injustice and inequality.\u00a0The trick, if you like, of museums is to collapse time, to shrink history and geography until we can see all things at once. This same compression can be an opportunity. The flattened structure of a museum works to create comparisons, and we can use those in building solidarity. The best tool at our disposal is context: showing the repetitions of history and exploring the parallels between the imperialist exploitation of people and extraction of resources and wealth, and the neo-colonial violence with which corporations carelessly destroy our environment in pursuit of profit.So how do we pull these threads together? Climate crisis disproportionately affects those who are already marginalized racially and economically, and it is crucial to keep in mind how that marginalization was created in the first place. The organization BP or Not BP has consistently worked to highlight the essentially neo-colonial nature of oil companies, and platform the voices of campaigners for restitution with their \u201cStolen Goods\u201d tours, and interventions that contrast the BP-funded Stonehenge exhibition at the British Museum with the damage done by BP drilling into the petroglyphs at Murujuga on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia. The Stop Adani movement in Australia has also walked this line effectively so far. The Adani coal mines would devastate Wangan and Jagalingou lands, and displace communities in Godda to build power stations \u2014 an environmental issue that keeps the people most directly harmed at its center. And Members of the Indigenous communities impacted by these mines have led the campaign against Adani\u2019s controversial sponsorship of the Science Museum\u2019s \u201cGreen Energy Gallery,\u201d emphasizing that this is cultural as well as environmental destruction.For historians and educators, there\u2019s also a responsibility to address the deeper history of artwashing. The wealthy individuals who influenced the British Museum\u2019s collections and curatorial narratives in the 19th century have their parallels in the sketchy Chairman\u2019s Advisory Group, a group of anonymous representatives from massive corporations who have an unofficial role in steering the museum\u2019s decisions today. Museums under capitalism can\u2019t be completely divorced from these financial influences, but they can at least be transparent about them, and they have to expect that they\u2019ll face scrutiny for them.Pulling these threads together is crucial. A change in sponsorship without the restitution of stolen objects would be inadequate, just as engaging in anticolonial work without considering modern forms of destruction and marginalization is meaningless. We need both, together. The museum is not a space of equality \u2014 it\u2019s governed by uneven power and shaped by privilege, not a reflection of the world around it; nor is it an institution that consistently serves the public. This inequality is obvious to anyone kept away from their own cultural heritage by its cabinets. For those who don\u2019t personally experience the museum\u2019s inequality, or don\u2019t see it as immediately affecting them, being able to point to these concrete examples of deception and complicity can help us bridge the gap. The energy and creativity of climate justice protests combined with the rigor and determination of anticolonial movements is formidable. With solidarity and effort, it could be transformative.Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

She also said that Ukrainian officials were working with UNESCO to distinguish cultural heritage sites with the Blue Shield emblem to afford them with enhanced protection status. If such sites are granted this status, their destruction would constitute evidence of a war crime. Attacks in Ukraine have already decimated several churches, and many Ukrainians are scrambling to evacuate treasured artifacts that are at high risk of destruction in future strikes. Earlier this week, on March 16, a theater in the eastern port city of Mariupol that sheltered at least 1,000 civilians was bombed by Russian forces; it remains unclear how many were killed in the attack. A museum in the town of Ivankiv near Kyiv, housing a number of works by the artist Maria Pryimachenko, was bombed on February 28. Many Ukrainians see such callous neglect of its heritage as part and parcel of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s nationalistic campaign to deny Ukraine of its cultural specificity, and hence sovereignty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky has contended that the Kremlin is intent on the \u201cerasure\u201d of Ukraine\u00a0as an independent sovereign state.With the prospect of a coordinated assault on Ukrainian cultural treasures on the horizon, civilian documentation of the destruction of cultural heritage is encouraged. Despite its cautionary statement on broadcasting information on efforts to salvage Ukrainian heritage properties, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy recently rolled out a website where those who have witnessed cultural crimes across Ukraine are asked to submit photo and video evidence. Lazare Eloundou, head of Unesco\u2019s World Heritage Centre, reported that the agency was increasingly receiving reports about the destruction of cultural heritage in several cities, and that its officials were working closely with local cultural professionals to develop an \u201caction plan.\u201d Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

That building, designed by Jorge Machado Moreira, housed the University of Architecture and Urbanism, whose Research and Documentation Center \u2014 or N\u00facleo de Pesquisa e Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o (NPD)  \u2014 contained archival equipment like cameras, scanners, and computers. It also held over 50,000 documents and 5,000 photographs recording more than 150 years of Brazilian architectural history. The papers included those associated with Brazilian modernist architects such as L\u00facio Costa, Affonso Eduardo Reidy, Roberto Burle Marx, and Moreira himself, as well as Europeans like Le Corbusier.Earlier this month, the Getty Foundation granted $240,000 to the NPD to restore the archives damaged by the fire, which started in an air-conditioning unit. Founded in 1982, the NPD was established with the purpose of collecting documents important to the architectural history of Brazil.\u201cThese collections are considered the most important architectural archives of modern Brazil\u2019s Carioca School, so the conservation and long-term care of these priceless items is our highest priority,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00edn Passaro, an NPD coordinator, said in a statement. The Escola Carioca, a group of architects active from 1930 to 1960, drew inspiration from modernists like Le Corbusier while hybridizing that style with Luso-Brazilian elements.\u00a0For 18 months, a team of conservators and an archivist will work with students in the Conservation and Restoration department at the Escola de Belas Artes and the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism to restore the collections. This will involve preventative measures like situating them in a new temperature-stabilized environment, while assessing the condition of what remains and keeping up-to-date records on a database. Students and staff will also be trained in best practices for the conservation of the roughly 38,500 objects that survive.\u201cWhile soot and water permanently harmed a significant number of items and the Center is now unusable, we can take comfort in knowing the bulk of our collection will be given a new home with suitable environmental conditions,\u201d Passaro continued.In recent years, preventable blazes at Brazil\u2019s museums and cultural institutions have occurred with upsetting regularity. In 2018, a fire at Brazil\u2019s National Museum eviscerated 90% of its collection, destroying one of the largest museums of natural history and anthropology in the Americas overnight. Among the many artifacts damaged were \u201cLuzia,\u201d the oldest human fossil in the Americas, and the most extensive Egyptian collection in the Americas. In July 2021, a fire enveloped the Cinemateca Brasileira, Brazil\u2019s foremost archive for film and television \u2014\u00a0an inevitability that many had apprehensively predicted given deep budget cuts and an observable pattern of negligence toward arts and culture under the governing regime.The grant is the latest one in Getty\u2019s Keeping it Modern initiative, which supports conservation efforts for modernist buildings worldwide. The conservation of the site of the NPD is important not only because it represents a significant building preservation in its own right. Its materials are additionally critical to preservation professionals, who \u201crely on collections like these to care for modern buildings,\u201d S\u00e3o Paulo-based preservation architect Silvio Oksman said in the statement. Getty indicated in a press release that it is currently doing conservation work on 77 sites, a majority of which \u201cinvolve the development of conservation management plans that draw heavily on archival materials such as those housed in the Jorge Machado Moreira building.\u201dJaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

Cumbo will succeed Gonzalo Casals, who stepped down at the end of Bill de Blasio\u2019s mayoral term in 2021 and joined the Mellon Foundation as a senior research and policy fellow.Last December, Cumbo voiced opposition to legislation\u00a0that allows nearly one million noncitizens living in New York to vote in municipal elections, arguing that it would \u201cshift the power dynamics\u201d in the city to the disadvantage of its Black residents.\u201cWe do not have the numbers or the information to know how that is going to impact African-American communities who have been the most vulnerable in our existence in our city,\u201d Cumbo told Politico. \u201cLaurie Cumbo has a recent record of anti-immigrant statements & policy positions. Her appointment is another deeply troubling sign that @NYCMayor is choosing intolerant political loyalists instead of listening to our communities.\u201d -Our @NatyAristiBetahttps://t.co/FEavbenhO6The comment drew ire from supporters of the legislation and immigration advocates including Luis Miranda, a political strategist and father of award-winning composer and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. \u201cI am sorry but Ms. Cumbo\u2019s recent anti-immigrant statements make it very difficult for me to support her appointment,\u201d Luis Miranda wrote in an email to members of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019s transition committee in January, when there was first talk of Cumbo being named commissioner.\u201cHer appointment is another deeply troubling sign that @NYCMayor is choosing intolerant political loyalists instead of listening to our communities,\u201d said Natalia Aristizabal, the deputy director of the immigration advocacy group Make the Road New York, in a tweet shared by the organization.Cumbo is a longtime and fervent supporter of Adams, who has defended her potential nomination. \u201cLaurie\u2019s a superstar, and I love Laurie,\u201d he told Politico in January.\u00a0Born and raised in Brooklyn, Cumbo earned an undergraduate degree in Art History from Spelman College and an MA in Visual Arts Administration from New York University. A member of the city council from 2014 to 2021 representing its 35th district \u2060\u2014 which covers several Brooklyn neighborhoods including Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill \u2060\u2014 Cumbo also founded the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts in Fort Greene in 1999. In 2017, Cumbo successfully sponsored a legislative package that increased funding for the Percent for Art program, a public art initiative administered by the DCLA. At the time, it was the largest package of bills in the history of the agency. She also supported and\u00a0passed legislation\u00a0to\u00a0create\u00a0the\u00a0first-ever citywide Minority\u00a0and\u00a0Women-Owned Businesses Task Force.\u00a0In a press release shared by DCLA today, several leaders of cultural institutions across the city,  including the Laundromat Project and the Brooklyn Arts Council, praised the former councilwoman and welcomed the appointment.\u201cLaurie Cumbo has been a tireless advocate for arts and culture organizations and, more particularly, organizations led by people of color,\u201d said\u00a0Melody Capote, executive director of the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute.But critics of Cumbo cite her record of culturally insensitive and polarizing statements that appear to pit ethnic groups against one another. In 2013, she apologized for writing in a Facebook post that \u201cthe accomplishments of the Jewish community triggers feelings of resentment\u201d among her constituents. The comment was made in the wake of a series of attacks on Jewish residents of Crown Heights and was interpreted by many as anti-Semitic. In 2015, Cumbo also apologized for expressing concerns over \u201cblocs\u201d of Asian Americans moving into public housing in her district during a council hearing.At the height of Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, Cumbo, who is Black, compared calls to defund the police to \u201ccolonization\u201d and said the movement was led primarily by White progressives.The DCLA is the largest cultural funding agency in the United States, providing hundreds of millions of dollars to more than 1,000 arts and culture nonprofits across all five boroughs of New York City.\u201cI thank Mayor Eric Adams for appointing me to this position. Together, we will center the arts\u00a0in\u00a0New York\u2019s economic recovery and bolster the educational and cultural experiences of every New York City student from Pre-K to CUNY,\u201d Cumbo said in the DCLA\u2019s statement. Echoing Adams\u2019s tough-on-crime rhetoric, she added: \u201cI also believe we can help address public safety issues in New York City\u00a0\u2014\u00a0taking a gun out of the hands of a young person and replacing it with an instrument, paintbrush, camera, or script will redirect the talent and passions of our youth towards building a better and more vibrant New York City.\u201d\u00a0Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

The press for Tate Britain\u2019s show Hogarth and Europe initially intrigues by promising to look at him in context with his European counterparts for the first time, \u201c[exploring] the parallels and exchanges that crossed borders and the cosmopolitan character of [his] art.\u201d While contemporary Britain is feeling the economic pinch from Brexit turmoil, this statement from curators Alice Insley and Martin Myrone sounds like a canny echo of pro-European Union sentiments.However, a different topical issue emerges as the primary reason for contextualizing Hogarth and Europe \u2014 that of societal inequality, racism, sexism, and colonialism. UK institutions are increasingly looking inward to examine their colonial pasts and links to slavery. Museum officials are rethinking ways to present the visual content of their collections, much of which perpetuates outdated and, at times, condemnable societal attitudes, and commissioning reports to identify where institutions have benefited from colonialism and slavery. In this spirit, we are invited to consider Hogarth\u2019s period of Enlightenment during the 18th century as having ideals \u201cproduced by, and [which] benefited, white men from the middle and upper classes. The concept of European superiority deepened, entrenching ideas about nation, personal identity, and racial difference, manifested in the horrors of transatlantic slavery.\u201dIt is unfortunate, then, that a heavy-handed approach to this project, combined with a lack of focus, sorely undermines the curators\u2019 honorable intentions. This is the first exhibition I have seen in which the lead curators write the main wall captions, but an additional group of \u201ccommentators\u201d has been formed to lend \u201cperspective and expertise\u201d in smaller captions. These include various art historians, artists, and conservationists, as well as the Museum Detox Interpretation Group, a body composed of people of color who work in museums and heritage and who seek to champion diversity in the arts. At best, the additional commentary is insightful and provides jumping off points for discussion, or highlights the significance of minor characters who are peripheral in the compositions. Issues arise, however, when it becomes too speculative \u2014 for instance, imagining the thoughts of marginalized figures in the artworks (often people of color) \u2014 or forces the agenda beyond provability. Next to Hogarth\u2019s \u201cThe Distressed Poet\u201d (1733-35), for example, is a caption by Lars Tharp that homes in on the presence of porcelain and tea imported from Asia (specifically a red teapot that is \u201cprobably Chinese\u201d), all of which are almost impossible to make out in the image itself \u2014 other visitors I noticed also struggled to find these items. This reading ignores the main focus, which is a poet slumped over his latest work in a decrepit bedsit, neglecting his family, and the presence of a milkmaid demanding an unpaid bill, in favor of barely visible tropes of colonialist expansion in tea and porcelain. Other details, such as a cupboard empty save for a mouse, and a dog stealing food from the family\u2019s plate, clearly emphasize the primary satirical focus on the social and romantic pretensions of the aspiring poet at the expense of feeding his family and paying those who serve him.It is actually a curious paradox that because the curators seek to find commonalities between Hogarth and his European contemporaries with the purpose of highlighting societal inequality, as well as exploitation and privilege resulting from slavery across the board, the exhibition might as well not be about Hogarth at all. This is unfortunate, as it is the most comprehensive collection of his art likely to be assembled for years to come; it includes 60 works, among them private loans and pieces from the US, notably the gorgeous portrait of \u201cMiss Mary Edwards\u201d (1742) from the Frick in New York.\u00a0The last room is filled with many portraits examining a trend toward depicting greater humanity in wealthy sitters, yet the question of inequality is again forced with this opaque explanation: \u201cSometimes, where these images suggest subjectivities rejected or compromised by the dominant ideas about race, class and gender, they hint at the unfulfilled promises and contradictions of modern European society.\u201d A valid point is hovering around in this ambiguous language, but the dense academic prose seems to sidestep direct address of wealth and privilege.\u00a0Yet what most complicates the attempt to both unify Hogarth and European artists and highlight outdated depictions is the question of satire, and how he used it. Take \u201cSouthwark Fair\u201d (1733), which depicts a fair that was held around Borough High Street every year until its abolition in 1762, and was often a scene of violence and impropriety. It is crammed with innumerable details of cartoonish figures engaged in revelry; on the far right a stage collapses under the weight of actors in a moment of chaos. Among the crowd are figures watching a peepshow, a dwarf playing bagpipes, and, in a clear indication of society gone topsy-turvy, a dog dressed as a gentleman and walking on its hind legs. It is demonstrably a wry condemnation of polite society breaking down with the excuse of a festival. Adjacent to the dog is a Black man playing a trumpet. The curators\u2019 caption posits a deliberate parallel between the dog dressed as a gentleman and the trumpeter, indicating that while \u201cmocking social class\u201d it nonetheless \u201csignals deepening ideas of racial difference pervasive in 18th Century culture.\u201d There is no further comment given to support this reading, so it remains more a suggested interpretation than an overwhelmingly convincing example of outright racism within Hogarth\u2019s work.\u00a0As the curators have centered inequality in 18th-century European society throughout the survey, satire promises a more productive way into the subject than simply looking out for evidence of colonialist tropes such as tea and porcelain or tobacco, coffee, and sugar \u2014 \u201c[latent] elements of exploitation and subjection\u201d \u2014 in Hogarth\u2019s \u201cA Midnight Modern Conversation\u201d (shown at the Tate in a copy after the lost original). This is not to deny the recognition of such items as evidencing horrific exploitation in their production, but focusing on such items threatens to sideline the potential for a more complex discussion. (Ironically, the attention to satire highlights how distinct Hogarth is from his European contemporaries, whose works on view never achieve his capacity for nuanced satire.)Far from simply recording things as they appeared, Hogarth\u2019s exaggerated compositions and other satirical elements are active commentaries meant to provoke thought. The introductory text says the works shown \u201cexpress a critical view of society, but they also reveal the entrenchment of racist, sexist, and xenophobic stereotypes. Artists may have celebrated individuality, but they also made representations of people that are disturbing or dehumanising.\u201d Within Hogarth it is this tangling of the exaggerated grotesquery of satire and the recording of figures informed by entrenched racist perceptions of the time that problematizes any straightforward interpretation of his images.The section on \u201cA Modern Midnight Conversation\u201d questions whether this image of white men falling about dunk, in various versions with Black slaves in attendance, is a moralizing condemnation of vice and the material mores of a society benefiting from slavery, or actually a gentle and affectionate ribbing of the behaviors of this strata of society, in which Hogarth was trying to ingratiate himself. In this instance we may see Hogarth as complicit in perpetuating colonialist stereotypes of slavery and oppression.If the overarching aim of this show is, as it seems, to uncover and belatedly condemn the racist elements of these artworks, it misses an important point. Yes, much of the art contains unacceptable imagery as it reflects social and racial hierarchies of the time. But why assemble the most significant grouping of Hogarths from far and wide simply to sweep it wholesale into this bucket, without indicating why calling out the faults in historical artworks is important to our understanding of our world today? Or, likewise, discussing the ambiguity of satire, which allows the artist to position himself as an external critic and be complicit in the critiqued acts. This same positional ambiguity enables much ingrained racism and white privilege still. It is a fact that social systems, and thus daily lives, in the UK and abroad are shaped by the horrors of slavery and colonialism, but in seeking out and condemning artifacts from the past the curators of this and similarly themed exhibitions risk historicizing racism. Rather, we should relate it to today\u2019s very real and still entrenched racism and sexism. In short, what can we learn from these artworks if we hold them up as mirrors?It is never a pleasure to address curatorial missteps when an exhibition has at its center a very urgent and honorable desire to condemn outdated racist views and stereotypes. Despite its shortcomings and sometimes muddled delivery, we should nonetheless admire the curators\u2019 effort to reevaluate Hogarth whom, for a long while, has received a free pass under the all-forgiving umbrella of \u201csatire.\u201d One of British art\u2019s most revered eccentric characters should not be exempt from criticism and the curators should be credited for creating a conversation around the issue in the first place. An important takeaway from the show is the encouragement more than ever to consider the societal and historical context in which art is made; in short, not to simply take its message at face value, which is a core principle of investigative art history.Hogarth and Europe continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through March 20.

This became obvious when I saw the exhibition Harriet Korman: New Work at Thomas Erben Gallery (February 24\u2013April 9, 2022), her fourth with the gallery. To further define the singularity of Korman\u2019s achievement, in contrast to many other abstract artists of her generation (she was born in the 1940s) who have been in pursuit of color, she does not nod to pop culture in her color choices, nor does she have a signature structure into which she drops her hues. Rather, she works in distinct series without any ostensible subject matter. As a consequence, she has not developed either a signature style or palette, those conventional access points the art world seems to crave. She wants the viewer to have a more direct and open encounter with her work, which is a seldom-traveled road these days.\u00a0As Korman states in the gallery press release:In this current series, I drew to find a form I wanted to work with. These drawings are not studies, I consider drawing to be an equal practice to painting and value them as such. While drawing, I chose a very simple, familiar form of concentric rectangles because it seemed like it would be an interesting challenge. I took that form into painting without referring to the drawings, and later used the drawings as sources for the paintings.Later, she adds:I try to capture the dynamic in the drawings; the color relationships, the proportions, the movement \u2014 what attracts me in the drawing, not copy it. This interpolation has many obstacles, pitfalls, inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies, but ultimately is very engaging.Korman\u2019s interest in proportion and movement are key to the dynamic relationships that she articulates in the recent paintings. While the paintings share the formal element of concentric rectangles there is nothing formulaic about what she does; each painting comes across as distinct, hard earned, and, at times, it seems almost rudimentary.\u00a0Many artists who explore color and geometry produce variations on a form or a palette, but this is never the case with Korman. You might think that she would settle into habits but she never does. I cannot stress how fresh and exciting this is. For one thing, each painting comes across as individual and specific, rather than as a variation on a pre-established form or another fill-in-the-colors version of geometric abstraction. By designating each work as \u201cuntitled,\u201d she shortens the distance between the viewer and the art by avoiding any detours through language and its attendant associations. \u00a0The freshness of these paintings is a result of Korman starting with oil stick drawings, which are meant to stand on their own, and do. In the drawings, she proceeds improvisationally: each color rectangle and the space it takes up determines what happens next. The width of the framing rectangles is markedly different and follows no pattern. The drawings work incrementally, in a process of adding without erasing or covering over one color with another that has its roots in Jackson Pollock and his poured paintings.\u00a0Each drawing becomes a possible structure to explore. The shift from oil stick drawing to oil painting, as well as the change in scale, evokes the legendary jazz pianist Art Tatum improvising Vincent Youmans\u2019s \u201cTea for Two.\u201d While respecting the original song, he makes it into something all his own. When the drawings and paintings are in close proximity, it becomes apparent how much Korman has transformed one thing into another, always while respecting the nature of her materials, the porous density of the oil stick, and the smooth solidity of the oil paint.\u00a0At the same time, there are a number of artists working this way \u2014 in which color calls to color \u2014 but I can\u2019t think of anyone as sensitive to the internal dynamics of proportion and density, and of the weight of one color against another, as Korman. These concerns, and her ability to trust her decisions without going back into the work, as if a perfect resolution existed, are why these paintings never become formulaic. Look at the ones on the gallery\u2019s longest wall and you will see that the proportions within the paintings\u2019 rectangles change and she does not work on an equally sized format: she is not programming her work according to consumers\u2019 desire for dependability. In recent years Korman has worked with saturated colors, so her use of browns and chartreuse signal something new in her work. In the case of brown, she uses it as a neutral (neither warm nor cool), causing the other colors to gain in strength, or places two different tones in close proximity.\u00a0In fact, while I was scrutinizing the paintings, both up close and from a distance, I realized that I kept doing something that I rarely do in an exhibition. I repeatedly stood back and gazed at a group of paintings, seeing what they shared and what distinguished them, and taking particular notice of how the density of the colors changed from work to work. It is so easy to overlook this crucial difference between Korman\u2019s art and that of other artists who, for example, work within a grid structure.\u00a0Korman\u2019s geometric abstractions make those of other artists seem flabby. With many geometric abstract artists the similarities among their paintings far outweigh the differences. That this never happens with Korman\u2019s paintings should clue you into what is remarkable about them \u2014 for which she should receive more recognition. Each painting possesses a quietly unique identity.\u00a0When she uses two yellows in a painting, as in \u201cUntitled\u201d (2021, oil on canvas, 48 by 60 inches), they are not the same, but it\u2019s the colors between them, and the width of each separating band, that makes their difference visually momentous. Walter Pater famously said, \u201cAll art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.\u201d Korman\u2019s paintings exist in a musical state; they compose an intuitively orchestrated set of optical vibrations that synthesize contrast and tonal shifts, large and small intervals, by underscoring difference.\u00a0She brings together different clusters and tones, some sharply contrasting and other tonally shifting. Sometimes the interval between related tones is marked by contrasting colors. And even within the internal configuration Korman will do something unexpected, such as frame the contrasting color with a wide and a very narrow band. The overall effect is that a viewer is continuously pulled into the paintings, and will begin to notice the internal harmonies and dissonances, and how they fit together without becoming subsumed into an overarching pattern.\u00a0At one point, I limited my focus to the edges of the concentric rectangle, and how some were curved, which made the concentric planes appear as if they were billowing. Then I began accounting for all that was not a concentric rectangle: a floating, diagonal, yellow-orange brushstroke within the deep orange rectangle in the center of the painting, a brown line within the narrow, red, centered lozenge-like rectangle.\u00a0We are not meant to see Korman\u2019s paintings all at once. The kind of looking her paintings and drawings demand, and should receive, is slow. As we become more attuned to her decisions, we may realize that we cannot ascribe any other motivation than the pursuit of a unique color sensation. It is a harder goal to achieve than one might think, and Korman is one of the few who has never made a signature form, or developed a market-driven aesthetic, within that domain.\u00a0Harriet Korman: New Work continues at Thomas Erben Gallery (526 West 26th Street, floor 4, Chelsea, Manhattan) through April 9.

For visitors who can still catch this breezy, trippy show before it wraps up its six-week-long run this Saturday, figuring out the title\u2019s significance from the works themselves can be more rewarding than relying on the autobiographical explanation. Byrne\u2019s nattily sketched word associations, surreal cartoons, and thought diagrams \u2014 also collected in A History of the World (in Dingbats) Drawings and Writings David Byrne (Phaidon Press 2022) \u2014 nod to art making as high-spirited brainstorming and insightful deviations.\u00a0The fact that mental detours serve as this show\u2019s unifying theme will be no surprise to any visitor with passing knowledge of Byrne\u2019s multimedia career. Like the drawings and writings at Pace, Byrne\u2019s output has involved creative sleights of hand that only appear effortless due to decades of savvy refinement. From his days as a two-time art college dropout turned frontman and chief songwriter for the punk-era juggernaut the Talking Heads to his current Broadway turn deconstructing the pop concert into postmillennial musical theater through the stripped down, gymnastic choreography of American Utopia, Byrne exploits our country\u2019s homegrown conventions. His subject matter ranges from advertising bromides to self-help talk to religious fundamentalist exhortations, their languages reframed into funkier, more skewed grooves and configurations that \u2014 like these spur-of-the-moment drawings and pictographs \u2014 make America\u2019s delusional optimism seem credible again.\u00a0Byrne\u2019s public reputation for proposing counterintuitive hopefulness provides another subtext in How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic. Although he enjoys a celebrity\u2019s comfortable perch in gentrified New York, the artist has publicly inveighed, insightfully and determinedly, against the city\u2019s ongoing encrustation in Midas gold. In response, less famous and well-connected fellow artists \u2014 including some in this publication \u2014 have charged him with ignoring creative communities and cultural initiatives thriving beyond Gotham\u2019s gilded zip codes. But living in the glass house of an elite Manhattan gallery, as Byrne does, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t throw rhetorical stones at the creepy commodification of nearly every facet of daily American life, provided you aim those objections at the right agents.That\u2019s not to say this exhibition is political. It isn\u2019t. But there\u2019s more than a winking nod to the inbuilt contradiction in showing unassuming drawings and writings \u2014 most made spontaneously by Byrne with a mere pen or pencil on archival paper \u2014 in an elite art gallery with global outposts. Set directly across from the ostentatious Chelsea skyline visible through the gallery\u2019s 7th-floor skylights and ceiling-to-floor windows, Byrne\u2019s small-scaled and spare drawings \u2014 many dating from the city\u2019s grueling lockdown period in 2020 \u2014 may remind us (and maybe reminded the artist as well) that art can be created wherever you find yourself entombed, and by using whatever tools you have in that bunker.So, is Byrne\u2019s art any good? Stylistically, the best drawings and most interesting verbal pictographs land somewhere between the interrogative visual adventures in Saul Steinberg\u2019s virtuosic drawings and the sometimes overhyped calisthenics of Keith Haring\u2019s charming silhouettes. As the exhibition spotlights the most rudimentary level of Byrne\u2019s visual repertoire, it\u2019s akin to observing, in any given city or small town, a daydreaming bus passenger with pen in hand, drawing or scribbling excitedly in a moleskin notebook. So the \u201cnon-rational logic\u201d to which Byrne alludes is the fertile mindlessness that goes into making art on an everyday basis.\u00a0And so Byrne shows that the pen has reasons that reason can never know. A still-life doodle of a woolen winter cap can metamorphose hairy human limbs and look ready to take a winter\u2019s walk. A self-assured pigeon gazing into its wardrobe mirror can see its neurotic human double staring back with reciprocal envy or admiration for what they both almost are, or aren\u2019t. Visual engimas like these play out through the drawings\u2019 consistently disarming humor. What causes the agony in Byrne\u2019s Mr. Potato Head as he grimaces and rears backward on skinny avian legs? Is the giant finger reaching down for a pill-sized smart phone that of a postmodern Gulliver, texted by Lilliputians who miss his company?\u00a0Some of the works that include writing \u2014 especially the wall-sized mural that dominates the exhibition space \u2014 represent Byrne scattering and then rearranging cultural code words and familial or social labels. One drawing shows that a cocktail bar\u2019s taxonomies can be as intellectually productive as a chemist\u2019s periodic table. Other word associations are set within the roots and branches of trees to reveal how pre-given categories can, without much conscious thought, outgrow or uproot former hierarchies; still other pictorial lists show how the subconscious mind classifies and distorts markers of human progress or worldly success.\u00a0Stop making sense, Byrne famously sings in the Talking Heads\u2019 underground dance hit \u201cGirlfriend Is Better\u201d (1982). And in the American decades since Byrne first plied his musical trade in New York\u2019s squalid Lower East Side clubs \u2014 in a far more egalitarian economy than ours and in a city that then had an undeniably more diverse, de-institutionalized artistic ecosystem \u2014 the willfully ignorant among us have increasingly seized power by denying empirical facts while claiming to be most enlightened, turning rationality ever more on its aching head. \u00a0So this lightheartedness is a tonic for our times even as the exhibition poses a serious question: Can the simplest gestures in art and writing revive optimism amid the dangerous nonsense and simplifications that pass for cultural and intellectual exchanges these days? In the liner notes to his album American Utopia (2018) Byrne, in the pre-pandemic Trump-era, comes close to eulogizing that American tradition of hope, before returning to the premise that \u201cto be descriptive is to be prescriptive.\u201d If you unpack that sentiment further in light of these drawings and writings, it\u2019s less a na\u00efve platitude than it sounds. And it makes me wonder what else art is for, but to remind us that what we call \u201cbeing reasonable\u201d is too often our expedient alibi for not using our imagination.David Byrne: How I Learned About Non-Rational Logic continues at Pace Gallery (540 West 25th Street, Chelsea, Manhattan) through March 19.

Hutson grew up in the strictly segregated city of San Marcos, Texas in the 1930s and \u201940s, where art was one of many things that were off limits to non-White citizens. \u201cI was born and raised in an environment where there were no incentives that would lead me to visual [or] fine arts,\u201d Hutson told Hyperallergic in a recent email. \u201cIf there was a gallery, museum or visual art venue,\u201d he explained, \u201cI would not have had access to it as non-white people in that town at that time could not have gone to such places without going there to either clean the bathroom, wash the windows or mop the floor.\u201d\u00a0The Art of Bill Hutson in San Marcos is a long overdue, city-wide tribute to the artist\u2019s innovative work, and his will to overcome challenges despite great odds. Curated and organized by Margo Handwerker, the Chief Curator and Director of the Texas State Galleries at Texas State University, and Linda Kelsey-Jones, the university\u2019s Community Arts Coordinator, Hutson\u2019s first exhibition in Texas presents more than 60 works across five venues, including The Calaboose African American History Museum, The Price Center, The San Marcos Art Center, Texas State Galleries, and Walkers\u2019 Gallery at the San Marcos Public Library. The exhibition offers viewers a rare chance to survey Hutson\u2019s prolific and varied output. It\u2019s also a frank and sincere gesture towards reconsidering the city\u2019s relationship to its own history with regards to race.Hutson was born in San Marcos in 1936. His father died when the artist was only five, so he and his siblings took on agricultural and construction jobs in addition to their school work to help out. The young Hutson found visual inspiration nearby. \u201cI was attracted to cartoons as our house, a shotgun house, had wallpaper that was actually newspaper,\u201d Hutson said by email. \u201cIn this way all during my childhood I saw cartoons and sometimes I would draw and copy them.\u201d Hutson saw his first painting on the campus of Texas State University, where he helped his mother at her job as a custodial worker. Still, Huston told Hyperallergic, \u201cI was nearly an adult before I became aware of fine art.\u201dThe turn to artmaking came after Hutson had finished high school and served in the US Air Force. He moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s, where he attended an art school and worked as a studio assistant to the artist Frank N. Ashley. In 1963, Hutson moved to New York City, where he joined the vibrant art scenes of SoHo and Midtown Manhattan. Over the next 40 years, the artist lived and exhibited between the US, Europe, and Africa. Hutson now lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where his art and archives are housed in the permanent collection of the Phillips Museum at Franklin & Marshall College.The cornerstone piece of the city-wide presentation is \u201cHomestead with signs, symbols and numbers\u201d (1979-1990), a roughly seven- by nine-foot canvas at Texas State Galleries. Crucially, Handwerker has included two preparatory sketches for the work, as well as the artist\u2019s model of his childhood home. Each of these elements helps the viewer to decode Hutson\u2019s complex constellation of signs that stand for the racial topography of the San Marcos of his youth, where African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans were prohibited from visiting downtown, using most public facilities, and frequently threatened with violence. In one drawing, for example, we see Hutson exploring themes of ownership, belonging, and space as he writes the names of local indigenous populations who have inhabited the region for centuries. He later references these groups in an abstracted painted teepee.The work is also technically layered. Hutson\u2019s thick, swirling passages of acrylic paint are carefully bound by sharp, angular edges. His shapes float over a textured green background treated with the artist\u2019s \u201cbind-stain-release-flatten\u201d technique, in which the canvas is condensed, dyed, and then stretched onto a frame. The method appears in several of Hutson\u2019s other pieces, along with sewing, 3D elements, and other interventions that alter the very fabric and structure of the work itself. Here Hutson seems to be challenging painting as a surface and concept. Other works are made up of moveable, modular components that can be configured freely.Ultimately, the piece embodies what Hutson calls the \u201ctragic paradox of \u2018home,\u201d where a point of origin is also a place of, in the artist\u2019s words, \u201coppression, bondage and insecurity.\u201d This complicated ambivalence makes this homecoming all the more important.Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

On Reddit\u2019s \u201cBuy It for Life\u201d forum, for instance, they\u2019ll find users showing off a Soviet-era toaster, a restored vintage Sunbeam, and other toasters to \u201cgrow old with,\u201d as one put it.

No. 11 is a complaint about Google\u2019s search results looking too similar to its ads, while No. 12 is a link to an alternative, indie search engine. Clearly, others share Brereton\u2019s sense of search-engine discontentment.Sportswashing is the practice of laundering one\u2019s reputation through sports; whether that be through team ownership, hosting a major tournament, or sponsorship. A country or politician gets involved with the hope that some of the sport\u2019s popularity will improve their image.As the world\u2019s most popular sport, soccer is an effective vehicle for sportswashing. Saudi Arabia\u00a0recently purchased English Premier League team Newcastle United.\u00a0Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was trying to sell London\u2019s Chelsea F.C. before\u00a0the British government sanctioned him.When the British entered the Benin Oba (King\u2019s) palace, they found \u201cseveral hundred unique bronze plaques, suggestive of almost Egyptian design, but of really superb casting,\u201d according to Reginald Bacon, an intelligence officer with the expedition. Soldiers walked out with the plaques, along with other art, ivory, brass, jewelry and garments. Thousands of pieces were taken.They were \u201cnot just loot, they were blood art,\u201d Australian journalist Marc Fennell explained on the podcast \u201cStuff the British Stole.\u201d Indeed, word was sent back to Britain that selling off Benin\u2019s objects could help offset the cost of the war.In New York City, the police commissioner\u00a0can and often does\u00a0choose to ignore the results of CCRB-brought disciplinary trials. The commissioner can ignore guilty pleas and can even decide there should be no trial at all, as appears to be happening in this case. Last year, the police commissioner followed through on the CCRB\u2019s discipline recommendations in serious cases\u00a0just 27% of the time.I sent the NYPD a series of questions, asking both about its power to ignore the CCRB and about how that power has been wielded in this case. I got a\u00a0one-sentence response: \u201cThe disciplinary process is ongoing.\u201dWe do know something about what\u2019s happened to the officers, and about their records. Thanks to legislation that New York state passed in the summer of 2020, police records are no longer secret. The CCRB\u2019s report names the officers involved.Trump\u2019s rise largely coincided with a push and pull over American exceptionalism that has now outlasted his presidency. Sides are not clean, are not divided by party or political orientation. The debate concerns not just what the United States is and can be, but in fact what this or any country can represent to its citizens and to the world. On the one hand are the exceptionalists\u2014those who hold faith in an America that is unique in the world and destined for greatness. Opposing the exceptionalists are a motley crew spread across right, left, and center who argue that America is, even beyond Trump\u2019s relatively amoral formulation, a force for ill. Let\u2019s call this inchoate ideology counter-exceptionalism. It\u2019s not\u00a0anti-exceptionalist\u2014that is, it is not simply an argument against American exceptionalism. Rather, it is an argument affirming exceptionalism\u2019s inverse: an ideology that argues that America either has always been, or has become, a unique force for ill in the world.Counter-exceptionalism has crept into our public spaces en masse\u2014and it is a force that threatens the political and cultural integrity both of the country as a whole and, in the more immediate term, of the ideological battles of those engaged in an earnest debate about how to better it. A left that cannot conceive of an America that has even the potential to be a force for good now struggles to make a positive argument for that good and concedes the grounds of hope and reconciliation to the exceptionalist right. The counter-exceptionalist right, meanwhile, has grown convinced of American decadence and decline\u2014it believes that the United States has become a sort of Sodom, and in that conviction has become increasingly hostile to democracy and amenable to violence as a legitimate political mechanism.In the first part of the finale on Monday, Clayton second-guessed everything and broke down in tears as he mourned Susie\u2019s departure. For some reason, this inspired him to be \u201ctransparent\u201d with Rachel and Gabby, who were waiting for him at the rose ceremony, since he was supposed to be narrowing the final three down to the final two. In what\u00a0host Jesse Palmer\u00a0excitedly called the \u201crose ceremony from hell,\u201d Clayton informed Rachel and Gabby that Susie left, and it had \u201cshattered\u201d him: \u201cI was in love with her. \u2026 I am in love with both of you. And I also was intimate with both of you.\u201d He admitted he had no idea whom to choose, and soon, the only sounds that could be heard were those of both Rachel and Gabby sobbing as they ran off in separate directions.Somehow (a producer\u2019s encouragement?), Clayton was able to cajole Rachel and Gabby to stick around and even meet his family, who had traveled to Iceland to meet his final two. Everyone pretended not to be miserable, especially Clayton, though afterward he did the worst thing: After putting everyone through that forced happiness, he realized the person he really loved was Susie.During one recent news bulletin on BBC Radio 4, the correspondent referred to \u201cPutin\u2019s baseless claim that the Ukrainian state supports Nazis\u201d. This is, itself, disinformation: it is an observable fact, which\u00a0the BBC itself\u00a0has previously reported on\u00a0accurately\u00a0and\u00a0well, that the Ukrainian state has, since 2014, provided funding, weapons and other forms of support to extreme Right-wing militias, including neo-Nazi ones. This is not a new or controversial observation. Back in 2019, I spent time in Ukraine interviewing senior figures in the constellation of state-backed extreme Right-wing groups\u00a0for\u00a0Harper\u2019s\u00a0magazine; they were all quite open about their ideology and plans for the future.\u00a0Indeed, some of the best coverage of Ukraine\u2019s extreme Right-wing groups has come from the open-source intelligence outlet Bellingcat, which is not known for a favourable attitude towards Russian propaganda. Bellingcat\u2019s excellent reporting of this under-discussed topic over the past few years has largely focused on the Azov movement, Ukraine\u2019s most powerful extreme Right-wing group, and the one most favoured by the state\u2019s largesse.\u00a0A New Zealand couple who believed they had dug up the world\u2019s largest potato in the garden of their small farm near Hamilton have had their dreams turned to mash after Guinness wrote to say that scientific testing had found it wasn\u2019t, in fact, a potato after all. Colin Craig-Brown, who first hit the tuber with a hoe last August when gardening with his wife, Donna, said it sure looked and tasted like a potato.

Excavation work is taking place ahead of the reconstruction of the church\u2019s spire after a 2019 fire threatened to engulf the cathedral whole.

Agence France-Presse reported in a visit to the site of the excavation that archaeologists could be seen removing a bust of a bearded man and \u201csculpted vegetables\u201d from the earth.

The decision may be seen as controversial to some museum workers who had pushed management to end a previous contract with the NYPD in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020. The museum also hired details from a private security company, according to several people who attended the meeting.MoMA has not returned Hyperallergic\u2019s repeated requests for comment.The enhanced security measures come after a former museum member identified as 60-year-old Gary Cabana attacked and wounded two front desk employees at the museum\u2019s Film Center entrance on March 12. Security footage showed the suspect leaping over the reception desk and stabbing the workers \u2014 a man and a woman, both aged 24 \u2014 multiple times in the back, collarbone, and neck. Bellevue Hospital in Midtown Manhattan said both workers were in stable condition and would recover from their injuries.MOMA ATTACK: Police say they're looking for 60-year-old Gary Cabana for yesterday's brutal attack inside the Museum of Modern Art. They say both 24-year-old victims, a woman and a man, are now in stable condition. But this is new video they released of the stabbing. pic.twitter.com/bS5eHo54LOAfter three days on the run, Cabana was apprehended at a bus station in Philadelphia. According to John Miller, NYPD\u2019s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, the suspect was \u201cupset\u201d that he was denied entry to the museum after his membership was revoked due to two past incidents \u201cinvolving disorderly conduct.\u201d Friends and acquaintances of Cabana said that his mental health has deteriorated since he lost his job as a Broadway usher during the pandemic. In a now-removed post on Facebook, he alluded to living with a bipolar disorder.MoMA workers who spoke with Hyperallergic reported an atmosphere of fear and trepidation at the museum in the aftermath of the attack. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because employees were asked by leadership not to give interviews to the press.\u201cWe\u2019re shocked at what happened, but we\u2019re not entirely surprised,\u201d said one worker who regularly interfaces with visitors. \u201cWe constantly deal with members who throw tantrums, especially at the film department.\u201dThe worker said that colleagues have previously expressed safety concerns about the film reception desk, saying it leads to a \u201ccul-de-sac\u201d and could leave workers trapped in the event of an attack. This scenario became a terrifying reality last week, as security footage showed the assaulted workers trapped behind the enclosed, curving desk. The museum has not responded to this allegation; the desk was relocated further inside the building after the attack.Workers at MoMA\u2019s Visitor Engagement department (or Visitor Services) count among the museum\u2019s most vulnerable, lowest-paid employees. The starting annual salary for a full-time Guest Assistant at MoMA is $36,131. After a year, a worker in the department becomes a Guest Specialist at $41,570. Salaries include benefits and tend to rise over the years based on seniority, largely thanks to years of contract negotiations between the museum and UAW Local 2110, the union representing MoMA workers and colleagues at other New York museums.\u201cWages are higher at MoMA because we\u2019ve been unionized for longer,\u201d said Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110, in an email to Hyperallergic. \u201cRates at museums that are non-union or have just unionized are much lower. At the Guggenheim and Whitney, for example, people start at $17-$18 an hour, are usually part-time, and don\u2019t have health benefits.\u201dRosenstein added that the union is currently talking to workers at MoMA about what security measures they would like to see in light of the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s been very traumatic, especially for those who work in Visitor Services and Membership,\u201d she said.

From the dialogues they build among themselves and with other artists, friends, and collaborators, these artists have established a personal language that enables them to present different layers of content and texture in their work.Origins of the PrizeBlack Mountain College (BMC) was a uniquely global college, with ideas and ideals grounded in worldviews that extend beyond the Western canon. In the same way, the legacy of the college has taken root across the globe, evolving and expanding to encompass disparate identities and forms of expression. Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center (BMCM+AC) is dedicated to preserving the history of BMC as well as facilitating new work through collaboration with contemporary artists. As they advance this mission they look to a blueprint set forth by BMC that valued the greater good, experimentation, and accountability.Funded by cultural pollinators Hedy Fischer and Randy Shull, the BMC Prize will allow BMCM+AC to continue on this path by building relationships and creating an impact with intention by supporting the creation of new work by the most innovative artists working within the BMC tradition today.

According to the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA), the juried Native American art fair features approximately 1,000 Indigenous artists from over 200 federally recognized tribes selling works ranging from pottery and textiles to jewelry and paintings.It\u2019s a far cry from its beginnings 100 years ago, when the market\u2019s organizers didn\u2019t allow participating Native American artisans to be seen by the buying public. Today, the country\u2019s largest Native American public event, which features contemporary and traditional Indigenous art from the United States and Canada, is organized and produced by Kim Peone (Colville Confederated Tribes/Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians), who\u2019s supported by a staff of mostly Native American women. Throughout its history, the market has often responded to the country\u2019s changing sociopolitical climate and the evolving creative output of Indigenous artists.\u201cIt originally came from a preservation perspective of cultures and now it\u2019s evolved into this place of sustaining and supporting living cultures,\u201d says Peone, who became the executive director of SWAIA, the nonprofit that helms the market, in 2020.The market\u2019s debut in 1922, a smaller affair presented under the mouthful title of The Southwest Indian Fair and Industrial Arts and Crafts Exhibition, was held indoors rather than the bustling Santa Fe Plaza. The event, which included Navajo rugs and Plains Indians beadwork and basketry, focused on ceramics in an effort to revive Pueblo pottery making, according to Cathy Notarnicola, curator of Southwest history at the New Mexico History Museum. (The Santa Fe cultural institution, in partnership with SWAIA, is set to open the Tradition and Innovation exhibition on August 7, 2022 that chronicles the history of the market; it\u2019s scheduled to remain on view through August 2023.)Notarnicola adds that the event borrowed influences from the Panama\u2013California Exposition, a World\u2019s Fair-style shindig that took place in 1915. Edgar Lee Hewett, an archeologist and director of the Museum of New Mexico, attended the San Diego fair and later co-founded what would become Indian Market with Kenneth Chapman.The market attempted to capitalize on New Mexico\u2019s burgeoning tourist industry \u2014 tourism remains one of the state\u2019s largest money-making enterprises \u2014 that brought visitors to the Land of Enchantment via the Santa Fe Railway, Notarnicola explains. It was also in response to the various failed US government policies \u2014 including removal, reservation, and assimilation \u2014 that attempted to wipe out Indian Country.\u201cIt was like salvage ethnography in an attempt to try to save what was left of Indian cultures after all the devastating policies,\u201d says Notarnicola.\u201cThe first market came at it from an anthropological perspective, thinking that they were going to preserve Indian arts because we were on the brink of extinction,\u201d adds Peone.Native artisans weren\u2019t allowed to sell their works in-person at the market until 1931, which predated the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, a federal government policy that attempted to reverse the damages of cultural assimilation.The post-World War II federal Indian policy of termination and relocation \u2014 the US government ditched its relationships with tribes so that Native people could be \u201ccivilized\u201d into mainstream White society, often in the big cities \u2014 did a number on Indian Market.The cultural event bounced back in the 1960s with the beginning of the self-determination era and the 1962 establishment of the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA). Notarnicola says IAIA, founded by Lloyd Kiva New (Cherokee) and George Boyce, is often credited for the inception of contemporary Native art. Fritz Scholder (La Jolla Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians) and Allan Houser (Chiricahua Apache) taught at the Santa Fe school; alumni include current US poet laureate Joy Harjo (Muscogee/Creek), sculptor, ceramicist, Indigenous food activist, and gallerist Roxanne Swentzell (Santa Clara Pueblo), and the late painter and printmaker T.C. Cannon (Kiowa/Caddo).\u201cAnother major shift occurred with regards to the mission of the market, which, in its origination, preserved traditional designs and technologies of the past,\u201d says Peone. \u201cToday, the market honors and encourages innovation in its works of Native artists.\u201dIn the 1970s, the market became a predominantly Native American-represented organization, according to Jamie Schulze (Northern Cheyenne), SWAIA director of operations, and has steadily grown. Today, the annual summer event attracts upwards of 150,000 visitors, who can talk with and purchase work from Native artists throughout approximately 17 city blocks in and around the historic Santa Fe Plaza.\u201cThere\u2019s a camaraderie that happens with artists and collectors where every year they get to see each other again and catch up on what\u2019s happened in the past year,\u201d says Notarnicola, who adds that she\u2019s seen the children of artists and collectors grow up together at the market over the last 30 years.Moving forward, Peone says Santa Fe Indian Market, which also produces a yearly winter market, will continue adapting to the contemporary moment while fostering personal and cultural sustainability for Native artists.\u201cWe are definitely pivoting,\u201d she says. \u201cWe really want to get away from an organization that only concentrates on two markets. How that comes about really comes from the perspective of partnerships and how we want to not only be a part of this community, but contribute to this community 365 days out of the year.\u201dEditor\u2019s Note, 03/18/22, 10:50am EDT: An earlier version of this article mistakenly identified the year Native artisans were allowed to sell work in person at the market as 1933.

All of them were done on mottled grounds in which the weave of the canvas was visible. The grounds were mossy green, dark brown, or earth red \u2014 colors we are apt to associate with nature. It is an association that Ryman would most likely have accepted, even as he would also have emphasized, in that soft-spoken demeanor he had, that nature was never a subject he pursued. These modestly scaled paintings \u2014 his last body of work before his death in 2019 \u2014 constitute the exhibition Robert Ryman: The Last Paintings at David Zwirner (February 10\u2013March 26, 2022), his first with the gallery, which now represents his estate.\u00a0It is both unfortunate and understandable that Ryman became known during his lifetime as an abstract artist who used only white paint, because \u201cwhite\u201d is a generalizing term that suppresses all the nuances that one encounters in his work. In each of the exhibition\u2019s eight paintings, the ground is never uniformly one color, as the density of the tone changes. The tonal change becomes evident when the viewer stands close to the painting, which is something that Ryman must have wanted, because, with at least one work, one side is a darker hue than the painting\u2019s surface, suggesting that he added another brushstroke of thin color. These differences and shifts in the ground are picked up in the topography of brushstrokes he built up on the modulated surface, always leaving the painting\u2019s four edges visible.\u00a0While the visceral shape always fits within the support\u2019s surface, its placement and relationship to the painting\u2019s physical edges vary, as do the brushstrokes. In \u201cUntitled\u201d (2010, 18 by 18 inches, oil on stretched cotton canvas), which was done on an earth-red ground \u2014 a color that also calls up Greek red-figure pottery \u2014 the shape comes right up to the edge on the painting\u2019s ride side, while Ryman left more space between the paint and the edge of the canvas on the left and along the top and bottom.\u00a0In this painting, Ryman began with short gray-green brushstrokes, some of which he covered over as he added more paint. After this first layer, he added celadon strokes. By the time he added the thicker white brushstrokes (tinged with ochre yellow), he had already laid down two layers of paint. The white paint sits within the shape made by the first two layers, but Ryman did not try to cover all evidence of what preceded this final layer. The paint\u2019s thickness results in a rough, uneven surface in which the celadon strokes peek through, as do the gray-green strokes that extend beyond the white along the top left and side edges.\u00a0While these turned out to be Ryman\u2019s last paintings, they do not feel that way \u2014 he did not know that he would have an accident and be unable to paint again. There is a joy to these paintings, as well as a playfulness, all arising from the artist\u2019s sensitivity to tone, contrast, placement, and natural light, which is how he would have wanted them to be seen. I remember Ryman suggesting that I go to one of his shows in the late afternoon, when the paintings would be illuminated by the darkening sky filtering in through the skylight. He wanted his work to be seen without being enhanced by artificial light.\u00a0Ryman\u2019s preoccupation with the relationship between the painting and natural light brings me back to my initial suggestion that nature was key to his work. His belief in paintings as flat, square objects placed against the wall and seen in natural light, as things in the world, is the foundation upon which he developed his practice. That understanding of painting became the circumference within which he worked and where he found immense freedom and joy.\u00a0While art historians and critics have predominantly focused on what Ryman absorbed from Mark Rothko \u2014 a consciousness of the painting\u2019s physical edge and the placement of the shape within \u2014 and from the cluster of creamy vertical and horizontal strokes in Philip Guston\u2019s paintings from the early 1950s, it seems to me that he also drew on other inspirations that might be considered unfashionable, which is why they are seldom if ever mentioned.\u00a0Two of the artists that I am thinking about are Edwin Dickinson and Bradley Walker Tomlin, whose works were in the house Ryman and his wife, the artist Merrill Wagner, lived in for many years. Doesn\u2019t the green that Tomlin used in \u201cNumber 9: In Praise of Gertrude Stein\u201d\u00a0(1950) remind you of some of the greens one finds in Ryman\u2019s paintings? (Isn\u2019t it worth remembering that Guston dedicated a painting to Tomlin and readily admitted that he was an inspiration?)\u00a0Ryman, who worked as a guard in the Museum of Modern Art for seven years, was an autodidact. He educated himself in the museum and never lost his initial curiosity about paint, materials, and the hardware that went into a painting. For him it was all a joy, inflected with a sense of humor. Nothing about painting was mundane. He knew everything he used had its own identity and he was respectful of that, down to the color of a nail and the shape of its head. The pleasure he took in seeing and sensing the world of things so closely is what viewers who are open to his work will take away.\u00a0Just as Ryman considered the density and viscosity of paint, whether it was lead or titanium white (and how much red, blue, or yellow ochre it contained), different surfaces (aluminum, Tyvek, canvas, and linen), where to start and stop, and how to affix it to the wall, and was always conscious of every choice he made, always responsible for it, he invites viewers to do the same. We do not just look at a Ryman painting; we see ourselves looking at it, walking around it, scrutinizing the relationship of the painting\u2019s sides to the surface. He was not interested in having a painting reveal itself all at once, and in that regard he stood apart from many of his contemporaries\u00a0In her groundbreaking book, Robert Ryman: Used Paint (2009) Suzanne P. Hudson cites the artist\u2019s statement about his beginnings:\u00a0I thought I would see what would happen. I wanted to see what the paint would do, how the brushes would work. This was the first step. I just played around. I\u00a0had nothing really in mind to paint. I was just finding out how the paint worked, colors, thick and thin, the brushes, the surfaces.\u00a0While Hudson focuses primarily on what Ryman learned by working in the Museum of Modern Art, where he took an art-education class on experimental painting in 1953 (although he claimed to have no detailed memories of what he learned in it), it should also be stressed that his approach to painting was influenced by his desire to be jazz saxophonist and his study with the pianist Lennie Tristano. When he abandoned that dream and focused on painting he remained true to something bebop musicians embraced: an openness to experiment and to discovering how the instrument worked. His approach to painting reminds me of Rahsaan Roland Kirk\u2019s experiments with all different kinds of saxophones (he was known to wear three around his neck when he played a concert). Disinterested in the idea of the masterpiece, Ryman defined a very different trajectory than that of his peers. \u00a0Robert Ryman: The Last Paintings continues at David Zwirner (34 East 69th Street, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through March 26.

The two brothers first made a big splash in the 1990s, when they fabricated a gruesome, three-dimensional version of an etching by Goya from a series called The Disasters of War. This assemblage of lopped and mutilated, mannequin-like human limbs hanging from a tree was shown in an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1997 called Sensation. It was a nasty piece of work. It likely made you wince because it seemed to lack compassion or human feeling of any kind. It was also entirely characteristic. The brothers seemed to revel in the business of provoking and outraging the world. They wanted to be seen as bruisers, Bad Boys, agents provocateurs. They bristled with a kind of sneery arrogance.\u00a0I first met them at their studio in London\u2019s Old Kent Road in the autumn of 1998. Jake was the spokesman, the reader, the intellectual, the pushy one; Dinos tended to hang back. Our conversation rapidly declined into an unpleasant argument. Jake heaped mockery and derision on my shoulders. He told me that I knew nothing about art at all. He was even kind enough to give me a reading list. I told him that I honestly thought the 75-page catalogue essay he had written to accompany a show in New York was one of the most pretentious pieces of crap I had ever read, an ill-digested mash-up from bits of Heidegger, Sartre, and others, worthy of a teenager. Jake, I felt, was loving every minute of this bit of verbal brawling. This is how he wanted to engage with art critics and journalists. It would give him notoriety, enemies. And it did. It did. Their eye-catching acts of provocation continued. They reveled in it. They bought a collection of utterly banal paintings by Adolf Hitler, and painted over parts of them in silly and clownish ways. Once again, the action felt attention seeking. What they had done could be taken exception to in a variety of ways. Tastelessness, for example. Who in their right mind would wish to buy and then exhibit \u2014 and thereby associate themselves with \u2014 bad paintings by a monster called Hitler? And then daub over them?\u00a0In 2003, they were shortlisted for the Turner Prize, and they put on a considered show of public outrage when they failed to win. Grayson Perry, who became more than their equal at the art of showmanship and look-at-me-ism, beat them to it. It was in that exhibition that they returned once again to Goya, who has proven to be an abiding obsession of theirs. This time they painted over an entire suite of those same etchings referred to above, adding clownish heads and other trivializing details of buffoonish defacement. Oh horror! How the art world howled! All very good for the Chapmans\u2019 publicity machine.And now we are all a quarter of a century older and wiser, and I am talking to Jake Chapman once again \u2014 the call is mediated by Yuval Etgar, the young Israeli curator who conceived this exhibition with him \u2014 over the telephone from his home in the Cotswolds, which is as far away in mood from the Old Kent Road as you could possibly conceive. Much else has changed. He and his brother have suffered a divorce. They are no longer quite that cheeky twosome, artistic bomb-tossers of the 1990s. Dinos now lives and works as a solo artist in Los Angeles. The Cotswolds, where his brother Jake has his home, is generally depicted as a snapshot of a timeless, sweet-faced rural idyll of the England that once used to be. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened then?\u201d I ask Jake. Was it a painless divorce? We were never joined at the hip, Jake tells me. It wasn\u2019t a symbiotic relationship. He always read a lot, whereas Dinos didn\u2019t. Is he still a Bad Boy? I wonder. He partly answers the question for me without my even having to ask. It\u2019s quite hard, he tells me, going from being a YBA to an OAP \u2026The new show is, nevertheless, a thoroughgoing and unmistakably Chapman endeavor. Having said that, it is also less shrill and combative than in the past, and perhaps more calmly thought-provoking. Yet it still manages to include the odd whiff of quite deliberate \u2014 and perhaps even tasteless, if not downright unpleasant \u2014 provocation. The press materials tell us that the show \u2014 which is called Bad Manners \u2014 is an exploration of \u201cnon-consensual\u201d collaborations between artists from about the middle of the 19th century to the present day. You cannot help but linger over that compound adjective, \u201cnon-consensual,\u201d and quietly reflect upon the fact that it is most often used in the context of sexual assault. So the ante is being raised \u2014 as usual.So what exactly do we have in this gallery today? We have a number of works that could be described as cannibalistic: an artist has acquired a work by another artist and done something with it and to it \u2014 drawn on it, added to it, turned it into a part of something quite different from what it was in the first place, and\u00a0all without the permission of its creator. Once this happens, confusion sets in: who is now the creator of this work? Is there anger and dismay too? Not necessarily from the original creator because he or she may be dead, and therefore beyond the reach of caring at all.\u00a0One of the most interesting examples of cannibalistic collaboration in this show is what looks like a smallish wooden coffee table raised up on a low plinth. In many respects it looks thoroughly unremarkable. And yet something rather odd has happened to its surface. In fact, set into that surface is an abstract painting by Gerhard Richter. Who had the barefaced cheek to turn a painting by Richter into the surface of something as banal and unremarkable as a coffee table on which you might easily and unthinkingly plonk down a cup of coffee? Martin Kippenberger did it, one of the postwar German bad boys \u2014 they do come in many different nationalities. And did Richter complain? I ask Yuval Etgar. Not as far as he knows. He probably thought it was quite a good joke. Artists generally don\u2019t complain when this sort of thing happens. They leave that to the collectors, the dealers, the advertising men. \u00a0Bad Manners: On the Creative Potentials of Modifying Other Artists\u2019 Work continues at Luxembourg + Co.

In Raychel Carri\u00f3n\u2019s monochrome graphite drawing \u201cRomper\u201d (2020) \u2014 \u201cto break\u201d \u2014 rows of empty bus seats emerge from a thick, textured darkness akin to smog. In the foreground, the distinct shape of a police baton can be discerned amid the sinuous curves of metal railings, chain-like patterns, and strap handles that resemble hooks \u2014 mundane elements made sinister.\u201cOn the 27th of January, in front of Havana\u2019s Ministry of Culture, agents of Cuban state police beat approximately 20 activists, artists, and reporters who were reading poetry,\u201d reads a wall label for the work now on view at Montserrat Gallery in Manhattan, written in Spanish. \u201cThat day it was shown that in Cuba, what is called \u2018culture\u2019 is just another arm of power and repression.\u201d An audio clip accompanying the piece amplifies the screams heard as officers apprehended participants of the pacific homage to Cuban author and journalist Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, shoving them onto the bus Carri\u00f3n so uncannily captured.Some of the artists included in Umbral, conceived by Havana-based curators Claudia Genlui and Anamely Ramos, were present that dark day in Havana, and are often on the frontlines of similar incidents so frequent in Cuba that they have become almost commonplace. In this exhibition of works by Cuban artists, activists, and members of the dissident San Isidro Movement, several names are familiar for their recurrence in headlines decrying state repression of free speech and creative freedom. One of Luis Manuel Otero Alc\u00e1ntara\u2019s symbolic Door paintings hangs next to a blue hard hat worn by the artist as part of a performance piece during the month of February 2020, after three children died when a building collapsed in Old Havana the previous year. Alc\u00e1ntara was detained several times for wearing the helmet in public, a wall text says. And he remains in a maximum-security prison in Havana at the time of this writing, behind bars for the last eight months as one of hundreds arrested during historic anti-government protests on the island last year. When Umbral opened on March 5, Genlui, his partner, had not heard from Alc\u00e1ntara in weeks and knew his health was rapidly declining after he declared a hunger strike in January; it was not his first.\u00a0Last year\u2019s peaceful demonstrations in Cuba, which found echoes in solidarity protests around the world, were largely prompted by longstanding food and medicine shortages and poverty exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two prints by Aryam Rodriguez feature bottles of rum the Cuban government handed out to households last December, a strategy to deflect attention from these scarcities, as a wall text explains. The rum was distilled using sugar from the 2020-2021 Zafra harvest, dubbed the \u201cworst in the last 120 years in Cuba\u201d due to lack of fuel, machinery parts, and low yields.Ramos explains the resonance of the title Umbral, or \u201cthreshold,\u201d as \u201cthe idea of remaining at the entrance of something, but at a distance.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe fundamental thesis is that when you talk about Cuba, you have to enter a previous, introductory space, the Umbral, where certain notions that are difficult for the rest of the world to understand are explained through the voices of these artists who are in danger,\u201d Ramos told Hyperallergic at the opening of the show.\u00a0The term encompasses the specific dystopia of voicing dissent while living on the island as well as the tension of existing as a Cuban citizen anywhere in the world, as the government maintains discretionary power to deny entry into or exit out of the country. Ramos currently finds herself currently inhabiting this \u201climinal space,\u201d she adds: When she attempted to return to Havana from the United States last month, gate agents prevented her from boarding the flight.\u201cUmbral was created from a place of permeability,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cIt is resistance, it\u2019s an attempt to reflect on what a frontier is, where Cuba begins and where it ends, and what it means to be safe in Cuba today.\u201dArtist Camila Lob\u00f3n, a Camag\u00fcey native whose works on view include illustrations designed for various civic actions on the island, recently completed a residency in Miami and plans on returning to Cuba. \u201cThe generation I identify with has a deep consciousness around this question of naturalizing the fact of returning, of entering and leaving and coming back, of regaining our ownership over the territory,\u201d Lob\u00f3n told Hyperallergic.\u00a0\u201cIn my case, I don\u2019t think about the concept of country or nationalism \u2014 it\u2019s my home, it\u2019s where the people I love are, and for that reason, I have the right to be there,\u201d she said.In their subtle elegance, Lob\u00f3n\u2019s drawings are tacitly subversive. One of them depicts three stages in the metamorphosis of a butterfly labeled with the words \u201cresistance, contempt, and disobedience,\u201d the charges on which rapper Maykel Osorbo was arrested in May 2021. Another, a drawing of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed modeled after Cuban modernist Jorge Arche\u2019s iconic portrait of the writer, was made for a \u201cpoetic pilgrimage\u201d calling for the liberation of rapper Denis Solis in 2020. \u201cI have two homelands: Cuba and the night,\u201d it reads, citing Mart\u00ed\u2019s poem. \u201cOr are they one?\u201d\u201cCarolina [Barrero], a historian and activist, had the idea of making these as posters and giving them away. We never got to do that, because police intervened in her home, found the prints, and accused her of \u2018clandestine printing,\u2019\u201d Lob\u00f3n said. \u201cSomething as simple as the image of Mart\u00ed, because of the gesture it implied about autonomy over an image, over an idea, is seen as an act of rebellion in Cuba.\u201d\u00a0Alexis Romay, a Cuban writer and teacher who attended the opening of Umbral, left the island in 1999. When asked if he plans on returning, he quotes Heraclitus: \u201cNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it\u2019s not the same river and he\u2019s not the same man.\u201d\u201cI resist the hyphen: I don\u2019t call myself \u2018Cuban-American.\u2019 I am profoundly Cuban,\u201d Romay told Hyperallergic. \u201cBut like many other Cubans, I told myself that I cannot return to that Cuba. I can\u2019t return to a place from which I escaped.\u201d\u201cWhat they are doing \u2014 Anamely, Camila, Claudia \u2014 is asserting the idea that this country is ours,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever step on Cuban soil again, but if I do, it\u2019s because of them. They are returning to me a country that I had lost.\u201dA screen plays the music video for \u201c\u00bfDe qu\u00e9 me van a hablar?\u201d (\u201cWhat are they going to talk to me about?\u201d) (2021) shot by Anyelo Troya and featuring Osorbo and Elexer Funk \u201cEl Funky,\u201d which calls for freedom for Alc\u00e1ntara and members of the San Isidro Movement. Osorbo and El Funky are co-authors of \u201cPatria y Vida,\u201d which became a rallying cry for freedom during the peaceful protests of July 2021. When the video for that song began to \u201cspread like wildfire\u201d among Cubans, wrote curator Coco Fusco for Hyperallergic, the government launched a defamation campaign against it that included homophobic attacks. Osorbo is currently in prison and El Funky lives in exile in the US. Troya is in Havana with a yearlong order that restricts his mobility.\u00a0In a small room in the back of the gallery, Indira Romero, a Cuban artist and performer, offers tarot readings with a deck of cards illustrated by many of the artists in the show.

Encompassing work by 12 women photographers that spans the course of the 20th century, this impressive exhibition showcases these artists\u2019 creative ingenuity and their raw technical skill. The exhibition title cleverly inverts Laura Mulvey\u2019s concept of \u201cthe male gaze\u201d \u2014 which, according to Mulvey\u2019s well-known essay, objectifies and fetishizes its female subjects \u2014 while rightly acknowledging that its artists\u2019 perspectives are not universal; it is a vision, not the vision. A Female Gaze includes a wide range of street photography, not all of which was taken at street level. Several works by Ruth Orkin were taken looking down from the artist\u2019s apartment window, giving the scenes an angled, almost Constructivist appearance. \u201cMan in Rain\u201d(1952) is one such image, which masterfully captures individual raindrops \u2014 no easy feat, even with today\u2019s digital technology. Berenice Abbott\u2019s show-stopping aerial photograph \u201cNight View, New York\u201d(1932) is one of those works that now looks clich\u00e9 because of the decades of photographers who have tried to imitate it. The level of detail in the gargantuan gelatin silver print is startling; despite the photograph\u2019s 15-minute exposure time, one can still make out the rooms behind each illuminated window.Many of the women in A Female Gaze were members of the Photo League, a New York cooperative of socially conscious photographers that was active from 1936 until 1951, when its leftist origins landed it on a Justice Department blacklist. The organization championed work that was both aesthetically composed and socially significant; for example, Helen Levitt, one of the better-known female photographers associated with the group, documented children on the on the streets of New York and the chalk drawings they left behind. One of the works from this series, \u201cN.Y.\u201d (c. 1942), depicts a delightfully youthful chalk portrait of a girl with a sly smile. Positioned so that only the plane of the sidewalk is in view, the photograph itself becomes a kind of abstract drawing, recalling Brassa\u00ef\u2019s Graffiti photo series of the 1930s. Women like Levitt made up almost a third of the League\u2019s membership, serving significant roles within the organization at a time when women were rarely allowed such agency.Whether these women of the Photo League were really \u201cencouraged equally alongside their male counterparts\u201d as the press release claims is up for debate; as Catherine Evans writes in The Radical Camera: New York\u2019s Photo League 1936-1951, the League \u201cencouraged women but did not entirely support them.\u201d Photo League editors \u2014 just like their gallery and institutional counterparts \u2014 favored work by male photographers, leaving many of the group\u2019s female members to return to the domestic roles that society expected of them. Today, much of their work has been lost.Hopefully, A Female Gaze signals a new direction for Howard Greenberg Gallery\u2019s program, which has skewed disproportionately white and male. While the art world has become increasingly conscious of gender and racial inequity in recent years \u2014 and the gallery itself is predominantly staffed by women \u2014 its program has in fact become less equal along gender lines over the past decade. From 2013 to 2015, its website indicates that 26 percent of its solo exhibitions were of female artists; from 2016-2018, as the MeToo movement gained traction, this figure dropped to 18 percent. Since 2018, solo presentations by female artists now stand at a dismal 7 percent. Of the 66 artists that Howard Greenberg lists as representing on its primary roster, 10 of them are women. (Only two Black artists are included in this list: Gordon Parks and James Van Der Zee.)From its inception, Howard Greenberg Gallery has championed a socially conscious approach to photography similar to that of the Photo League; a pioneer in the art market, the gallery fought for photojournalism and street photography\u2019s place in the canon. Its program, however, hasn\u2019t always matched its ethos. As one of New York City\u2019s leading photo galleries\u2014particularly as one that describes its collection as \u201ca living history of photography\u201d\u2014it should strive to represent an accurate, more complete view of that history.

The 2022 iteration includes several timely works about Ukrainian/post-Soviet history, a pre-COVID meditation on isolation from Poland, a survey of men who live in abandoned missile launch silos, and much more. One of the more exciting picks is As Mine Exactly, a virtual reality performance piece by filmmaker Charlie Shackleton. During the experience, a participant sits across from Shackleton in a room and straps on a VR headset. Shackleton then reads his lines aloud in the room as imagery from his youth plays on the participant\u2019s screen, laying out the story of his mother\u2019s experiences with epilepsy and how seeing her seizures as a boy impacted him. He not only narrates, but also \u201cconverses\u201d with his mother, whose voice is heard through a speaker positioned behind the viewer. By actively mediating the participant\u2019s interactions with this anecdote, Shackleton draws attention to the ways we already reframe and perform our pasts, both in how we personally process events and how we relate them to others. Hyperallergic sat down with Shackleton over Zoom to discuss the piece and the logistical and artistic headaches involved in making it. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and brevity.* * *Hyperallergic: Why was it important that you be a physically present part of this experience?Charlie Shackleton: I had qualms about telling this story on film to begin with, because it felt so personal, intimate, and sensitive. Some of the material and experience I let people in on, I was daunted by. I think when I had the idea of it becoming a one-on-one performance, that felt like it circumstantially matched what it represented to me to be sharing this story. However I did it, it would\u2019ve felt like I was confiding in the audience, so why not stage it in such a way that I am literally doing that? And everything that would bring to the performance would heighten the themes of the story. It is so much about presence and absence, so to have me present with the viewer underlined that in a way nothing else really could.H: Especially since, even though you are physically present, there\u2019s the distancing element of the audience member wearing the VR headset.CS: Yeah. It\u2019s fascinating to watch people do it. You\u2019re intensely close to someone in a way that you almost never are with a stranger. I\u2019m staring at their face for half an hour, but they can\u2019t see me back. They can hear me, how proximate I am to them, but it\u2019s a weird kind of proximity that\u2019s unlike anything else. I come out of it \u2014 and I think they come out of it \u2014 feeling both really close to the other person but also weirdly alienated from them. And again, that felt right for this. I can\u2019t imagine doing another piece like this, because I don\u2019t know what kinds of stories it would suit.H: How did you prepare to perform this way? What effect have the performances so far had on you?CS: I think I prepared in all the wrong ways. [laughs] I did have a long time to think about it, and I knew that it was going to be exhausting \u2014 emotionally, physically, even technically, having to be in command of the various components. All that turned out to be true, but in a different way than I ever could\u2019ve imagined. I think what I didn\u2019t really prepare myself for was how psychologically intense it is for a succession of different people go through something emotionally with you. And the reactions really varied. Sometimes it was easy to tell how someone was feeling, sometimes it was quite hard. But I think it left a psychic impact on me as well, just watching them receive it.H: Subjectivity is a recurring theme in your work.  CS: My short Personal Truth made me think about the layers of mediation in telling a personal story. Not only was my notionally conversational voiceover obviously scripted and had been reread so many times in recording it, but also what I was expressing as my unvarnished perspective was of course heavily filtered. It had been through many rounds of drafts in an attempt to make it satisfying, structurally and emotionally. I\u2019d always had this slightly uneasy relationship with how I presented myself in my own work; it\u2019s a strange semi-real, semi-unreal version. I knew that in telling a story that was so personal, I had to confront that within it. It would be dishonest to say that I can tell a story about this incredibly formative part of my life impartially or without artifice.H: How did you plot out what to put into the headset screen, and how to present it, edit it, arrange it, and more?CS: One of the things I like about that technology is that it feels experimental. You put the headset on and you can decide what you\u2019re going to do inside it; it can be completely spontaneous and impulsive. I didn\u2019t see that reflected in any of the broadly defined \u2018film work\u2019 being made for VR. It instead felt like everything was super polished. There\u2019s a focus on immersion that leads people toward sanding off all the rough edges and making grand statements. I was interested in VR as a DIY tool, especially because the technology is still so ropy and breaks as often as it works. It\u2019s only as useful as what it allows you to do, not for its own innate being. I wanted to make something that would evolve quickly and responsively as I was road-testing it. It\u2019s never going to stop evolving as long as I\u2019m performing it. It\u2019s already changed quite a lot just over the course of a week of doing it.The material evolved in response to showing it to people. I had endless material, thousands of childhood photographs and videos and things I\u2019d written, things my mom had written, any of which could\u2019ve been included \u2014 and a lot of which was included, at one point or another. But when you get someone in a headset, it\u2019s fascinating to see where their focus sharpens and where it doesn\u2019t. I can see where they\u2019re looking, what\u2019s catching their attention and whether that aligns with my intention. Those moments are what I tried to build the piece around.Initially I did what I think 99% of people who first make work for VR do, which is shoot a load of 360-degree footage. But because my piece is a theatrical performance as much as it is a work of VR, I had two spaces I needed to orchestrate: the 360-degree canvas of the headset and the physical space I and the participant occupy. And often the two worked against each other. I found that if I started the piece and all I gave them to look at was an image I put directly in front of them, they would focus intensely forward on that spot, which was where I was in the room. That bond was intense, and something I could exploit to create the intimate relationship the piece relies on. But when I showed them a 360-degree video, that bond was instantly severed; they\u2019d look around, look behind themselves. And as fun or immersive as it might\u2019ve been, I never got back that focus. That led me to strip back how much of the virtual canvas I occupied, to maintain control of the audience member\u2019s focus.Something that\u2019s also interesting about VR is the void, which you don\u2019t often get to see because most of the work is so visually populated. You don\u2019t usually get to linger on the strange absence of a frame, but I think that\u2019s intriguing. If I put something in someone\u2019s peripheral vision in a space they had gotten used to being blank, you can see how radical it is for them to suddenly breach this imagined wall. That wouldn\u2019t be the case if I had quickly filled in all the space and shown them a 360-degree vision of my childhood street.H: What technical and artistic changes have you made in this road-testing process?CS: Pacing is probably the biggest thing. What feels right when I\u2019m rehearsing feels totally different in an actual atmosphere with a human being. The pauses are often much longer now than I ever imagined they would be, either because the person is reacting in some way that I need to leave space for, or just because something strikes me in the moment and it feels like it needs to breathe.I also need to reassure people as early as possible that they don\u2019t have to perform. I really need to get that in the synopsis. If I was a viewer, I would be put off by the idea that it was immersive theater, where you have to play a role. I don\u2019t want to only have a self-selecting audience of people who would be up for that kind of thing. It needs to be clear that it\u2019s very low-key, low pressure, that the experience is ultimately being told a story by another human being.First Look 2022 runs March 16-20 at the Museum of the Moving Image (36-01 35 Avenue, Astoria, Queens).Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

Groh proved that a picture is worth a thousand words, as the only entry to elide the phrase entirely, replacing it with a single, eloquent gesture.The stamp is only the latest in what is being considered a masterful public image campaign on the part of Ukraine, encouraging national fortitude and international aid through a heady combination of stalwart determination to hold their ground, and wacky memes. Just as their Russian foes were early adopters of social media as a tool for disinformation and passive disruption of international politics, Ukraine seems to well understand the power of propaganda as a rallying call. And while it is somewhat unorthodox to put literal profanities on postage stamps, and canonize those who utter them as national heroes, it feels extremely fitting given the circumstances. Not only does it offer Ukranians something to hold onto as they continue their struggle, the new stamp also prvides a future opportunity to mail in Ukrainian parking tickets, tax filings, and other hate mail with a little something extra spicy on the envelope.Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s first museum survey challenges visitors to take in the full breadth of her artwork \u2014 as well as her activism and community engagement.Even for viewers who don\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, or alien life, the works in Supernatural America possess their own power.Brian Maguire: In the Light of Conscience is a cross-section of the artist\u2019s major series, which tackle human rights atrocities and conflicts.Fashion designer Patricia Michaels prepares for SWAIA\u2019s centennial.Two artists exemplify the power of storytelling at the center of Native American art.Celebrate the work of this year\u2019s graduating class and join us at BU Art Galleries on April 15 for the public opening reception for the Graphic Design show.In a recent episode on Aileen Wuornos in the docuseries, Catching Killers, one talking head investigator is baffled by her actions, but I understand her deeply.Despite all of the ancient painted objects in our museums, it\u2019s rare to see an actual paint set.Norwood\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York explores decoration, Black craft histories, and the politics of beauty, labor, and race.A researcher is calling on the LA museum to return the fresco fragment, claiming it was linked to Robert E.

The move marked a resolution to two decades of contestation over the statue, which will now be moved to Cross Keys Battlefield in Harrisonburg, Virginia, where it will be stewarded by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation.Standing at 13 feet in height at the courthouse lawn, the monument portrays a Confederate regiment from Talbot County that served in the Civil War. Erected in 1916, a single soldier totes a Confederate flag and peers into the distance wistfully. The granite base is inscribed with the names of 96 Confederate soldiers associated with the county in some way, with the front reading, \u201cTo the Talbot Boys / 1861-1865 / C.S.A.\u201d Previously positioned prominently on the greens just outside the courts where local residents would have to get essential business taken care of, the statue was a visual reminder of the persistence of unequal justice and racism in the United States.

There, family members found themselves fighting each other in battle. Although three times as many fought for the Union as for the Confederacy in the county, a promised Union monument to accompany the Confederate one was never realized. As such, Talbot County is often misremembered as a Confederate bastion in the state. A statue of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who was born just 12 miles away, does stand on the lawn, though it was only erected in 2011 after a long fight.#BREAKING: it\u2019s a big day in Easton today: the Talbot Boys Confederate monument is coming down.

However, the additional step complicated the workflow, required high levels of concentration and focus, and occupied over an hour of analyst time. Adding a manual pooling step was also quite risky from a quality standpoint, and we worried about the opportunity for analyst error.\u201dWe were already familiar with the ASSIST PLUS system, as we use it for our COVID-19 samples. It was easy to write a pooling program using the VIALAB software, and the flexibility of the 8 channel VOYAGER adjustable tip spacing pipette meant that there was no need to change our mosquito processing method. We use the platform to transfer aliquots from 2 ml tubes into a 96 well plate to create the sample pools, then add lysis buffer directly, using the entire pool for nucleic acid extraction. This streamlines the process, saving time and reducing the use of plastic labware, since we aren't constructing high volume pools then transferring an aliquot for extraction. We have seen a 75% saving in extraction and PCR reagents, and reduced the use of PCR instrumentation for the surveillance program, as well as saving precious analyst time. Most importantly, we have confidence that the most complex step in the process is being performed without errors.\u201dDenise Bolton, Laboratory SupervisorINTEGRA BiosciencesPosted in: Device / Technology News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: 96 Well Plate, Arbovirus, covid-19, Encephalitis, Laboratory, Mosquito, Nucleic Acid, Pipetting, Public Health, Reagents, VirusPlease use one of the following formats to cite this article in your essay, paper or report:APAINTEGRA Biosciences.

Promega research scientists collaborated with the University of California \u2013 San Francisco research group led by Dr. Kevan M. Shokat, a global leader in KRAS biology, to study the binding of potentially therapeutic molecules to common mutants of the KRAS protein. This study represents the first observation and quantification of direct target engagement of KRAS(G12D) and other hotspot oncogenic mutants of KRAS in cells using reversible binders.KRAS is a protein that serves as a \u201cmaster switch\u201d for regulating cell proliferation. It is the most commonly mutated protein in cancer. KRAS was long considered to be \u201cundruggable\u201d until 2013 when the Shokat lab identified covalent drugs targeting KRAS(G12C), a common mutant in which a glycine amino acid is changed to a cysteine. That discovery led to increased drug discovery research, and eventually the first inhibitors targeting KRAS(G12C).Unfortunately, other mutants of KRAS presented different challenges. All of the known inhibitors of KRAS(G12C) relied on an inactive state of the protein that other mutants do not frequently exhibit. The G12C mutation also provided the opportunity to employ covalent drug discovery methods that would not apply to other hotspot mutants. For those reasons, alleles such as KRAS(G12D) and KRAS(G12V) continued to be considered undruggable.The research published today in Nature Chemical Biology utilized a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assay to quantify target engagement of RAS complexes in live cells. They found that the switch-II pocket of KRAS was a privileged drug binding site for non-covalent ligands, and that this was not dependent on the activation state of KRAS. These results open new opportunities for targeting non-G12C mutants of KRAS in drug discovery.\u201cWe\u2019ve shown that some of these highly aggressive mutants are indeed vulnerable to small molecule inhibitors,\u201d says Matt Robers, Senior Research Scientist at Promega.With our new target engagement method, we can measure binding within living cells and show that the binding we see at these hotspot mutants actually translates into anti-proliferative effects in the pancreatic cancer lineages.\u201dMatt Robers, Senior Research Scientist, PromegaIn addition to the BRET methods for measuring target engagement, the paper also describes nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methods for observing reversible ligand binding in vitro and determining the state of the KRAS protein. The authors hope that the methods they describe will be a valuable tool for researchers to develop treatments for some of the most aggressive KRAS mutants previously thought to be \u201cundruggable.\u201dPromega offers a comprehensive selection of tools to accelerate RAS pathway drug discovery based on a sensitive bioluminescence platform.Promega CorporationPosted in: Drug Discovery & Pharmaceuticals | Cell Biology | BiochemistryTags: Amino Acid, Assay, Bioluminescence, BRET, Cancer, Cell, Cell Proliferation, Cysteine, Drug Discovery, Drugs, Glycine, in vitro, Ligand, Living Cells, Molecule, Mutation, Pancreatic Cancer, Proliferation, Protein, Research, SpectroscopyCancel reply to commentSonia PonzoIn this interview, we speak to Sonia Ponzo, the Director of Science at Flo Health, about their app and how it's revolutionizing the field of women's health.Linda Boekestijn, Dr. Glauco SouzaIn this interview, News-Medical talks to Dr. Glauco Souza and Linda Boekestijn about their work in the wound healing space and how they devised a new high throughput 3D model for would healing.Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie YeoIn this interview, we speak to Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie Yeo about their new research that looked at using sound waves to regrow bones.\r\r                                              \r                                                    News-Medical.Net provides this medical information service in accordance\r                                                    with these terms and conditions.\r                                                    Please note that medical information found\r                                                    on this website is designed to support, not to replace the relationship\r                                                    between patient and physician/doctor and the medical advice they may provide.\r                                              \r                                              \r\r                                         This site complies with the  HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.News-Medical.net - An AZoNetwork SiteOwned and operated by AZoNetwork, \u00a9 2000-2022"}, {"category": "medical", "title": "UEA research reveals the lasting impact of Covid lockdowns on people\u2019s mental, physical health", "description": "New research from the University of East Anglia reveals first-hand the lasting impact that lockdowns may have had on people\u2019s mental and physical health.", "text": "We use cookies to enhance your experience.

Our initial results showed that people were eating less fruit and veg, getting less exercise and drinking more alcohol.\u201cIt quickly became apparent that lockdown may have lasting consequences for the physical and mental health of the nation.\u201cWe wanted to see whether people\u2019s lifestyles changed in the long-term so we continued the study by carrying out regular surveys with the participants, and interviewing some people to find out more.\u201dNow, two years on, the team\u2019s results show how health inequalities are likely to have widened.Prof Notley said: \u201cSocial restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic have had a significant impact on health behaviors at the individual and population level.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that all of our participants\u2019 lives were disrupted by lockdown and they were forced to adapt.\u201cBut people responded to the lockdowns very differently and their experiences of social restrictions varied considerably.\u201cFundamentally, people were hindered or helped by their existing support structures and resources, such as access to technology to engage with the outside world, or private outdoor space.\u201cThose people who had good friends, community links and who were already health conscious, were able to respond positively and better able to cope.\u201cThey were able to adapt to the \u2018new normal\u2019, use technology to keep in touch with friends and relatives, order veg boxes, carry on with a healthy diet and take part in healthy pursuits in new and innovative ways such as online fitness classes or \u2018doing Joe Wicks\u2019.\u201cBut lockdowns are very likely to have caused a sustained widening of social and health inequalities.\u201cThose who remained in work outside the home, or who were retired, were the least impacted overall. But those who were unemployed, younger, on a lower income, clinically unwell or told to fully shield were particularly impacted by strict restrictions.\u201cFor these more vulnerable people, supportive social factors were taken away or severely restricted. Anxiety and depression worsened, and unhealthy behaviors like exercising less, drinking more alcohol, and eating a poor diet increased.\u201cAs we work through the \u2018roadmap to recovery\u2019, emphasis needs to be placed on a collaborative, community-based approach, with a focus on what makes us well.\"Encouraging membership of community exercise groups, for example, may help those most impacted to engage again with healthy behaviors to keep them well. We also need to pay attention to how those who are less well-off responded more negatively to the policy of lockdown, so that lessons can be learnt for the future.Prof Caitlin Notley\u2018Disruption and adaptation in response to the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 assets as contextual moderators of enactment of health behaviors\u2019 is published in the British Journal of Health Psychology.University of East AngliaPosted in: Medical Research News | Healthcare NewsTags: Alcohol, Anxiety, Coronavirus, Depression, Diet, Exercise, Fruit, Mental Health, Pandemic, Physical Activity, Psychology, Research, Sleep, SmokingCancel reply to commentSonia PonzoIn this interview, we speak to Sonia Ponzo, the Director of Science at Flo Health, about their app and how it's revolutionizing the field of women's health.Linda Boekestijn, Dr. Glauco SouzaIn this interview, News-Medical talks to Dr. Glauco Souza and Linda Boekestijn about their work in the wound healing space and how they devised a new high throughput 3D model for would healing.Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie YeoIn this interview, we speak to Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie Yeo about their new research that looked at using sound waves to regrow bones.\r\r                                              \r                                                    News-Medical.Net provides this medical information service in accordance\r                                                    with these terms and conditions.\r                                                    Please note that medical information found\r                                                    on this website is designed to support, not to replace the relationship\r                                                    between patient and physician/doctor and the medical advice they may provide.\r                                              \r                                              \r\r                                         This site complies with the  HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.News-Medical.net - An AZoNetwork SiteOwned and operated by AZoNetwork, \u00a9 2000-2022"}, {"category": "medical", "title": "New York Blood Center and Columbia University partner to advance the use of mRNA technology in HIV vaccine study", "description": "New York Blood Center\u2019s Project ACHIEVE and Columbia University\u2019s Columbia Research Unit are working in partnership for the New York City effort to advance the use of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology in an HIV preventive vaccine study \u2013 HVTN 302.", "text": "We use cookies to enhance your experience.

The global research effort is sponsored by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), headquartered at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health, and sponsored by NIAID.The Phase 1 trial, titled HVTN 302, is the second trial of its kind and will be enrolling up to 108 people across 10 sites in the United States to test 3 different experimental vaccines against HIV using the mRNA vaccine technology that has been successful in fighting COVID-19. The vaccines are experimental, meaning that they have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Researchers will study the safety of and immune responses to the different vaccines, focusing on which might be the best vaccine candidate as well as what might be the best dosage. \u00a0Both organizations have an extensive history of conducting research spanning all phases of HIV vaccine clinical research. They have conducted longstanding work in community engagement and recruitment throughout New York City, developing a reputation for enrolling a diverse pool of study participants and addressing mistrust in vaccine trials among racial, ethnic, and sexual minority communities.\u201cSeeing the first participant in HVTN 302 receive their initial injection of the study vaccine at our clinic site provides me hope that we can make a major contribution to the scientific community\u2019s goal to prevent the spread of HIV. Globally more than thirty-seven million people are living with HIV. There have been major advances in HIV prevention, care, and treatment, but a vaccine will impact the broadest segment of society. We\u2019re looking forward to applying what we learned from the COVID-19 vaccine trials to our research on this potentially groundbreaking vaccine,\u201d stated Hong Van Tieu, MD, MS, Head, Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention, LFKRI, New York Blood Center\u2019s Project ACHIEVE.We are immensely excited to be working on this significant advancement in HIV vaccine research. We have been studying various HIV vaccine products for decades and the science continues to progress. The major advancements in COVID-19 vaccine development involved the use of the mRNA technology. Applying this technology to the realm of HIV vaccine research is a major turning point. Community members in New York City continue to enroll in this study which will help further the global effort to develop an HIV preventive vaccine.\u201dMagda Sobieszczyk, MD, MPH, Principal Investigator, Columbia University\u2019s Columbia Research UnitThe HVTN 302 trial is evaluating three experimental vaccines; each participant in the trial will get one of the vaccines, all of which use mRNA technology. The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) on behalf of Scripps Consortium provides these study vaccines, developed by researchers at Scripps Research, for the study for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development (CHAVD).These study vaccines are manufactured using mRNA technology, a piece of genetic code carried into your body by the vaccine as a message with instructions. The mRNA technology was developed by Moderna for the COVID-19 vaccine, which instructs the body\u2019s cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Instead of showing the immune system pieces of HIV, the study vaccines carry instructions that show human muscle cells how to make small pieces that resemble parts of HIV but are not actual pieces of the virus. Therefore, participants cannot get HIV from the vaccines.When people get a vaccine injection in the muscle of their arm, the cells in that muscle will get the instructions and start to make the different types of HIV pieces and display these pieces on the surface of the muscle cell. The immune system will then be able to see these HIV pieces and learn how to recognize them.Researchers hope that the immune system will respond by making antibodies and T-cells that could fight HIV if a person is ever exposed to the virus in the future.The mRNA instructions do their work in the part of the muscle cell called the cytoplasm and only remain in the body for a couple of days before they break down naturally. The mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cells, which is where human DNA is located. Therefore, the mRNA cannot interact with human DNA.The study vaccines have not been given to people before. Prior research in animals was promising and found to be safe. The HVTN 302 trial is conducted in a way in which safety is carefully monitored.The process is simple: participants indicate that they are interested, they complete an online screener, and staff contact them to complete a pre-screen over the phone. They then schedule their first study visit, where the participant receives more information on the study, signs consent forms and undergoes a physical exam. After that, if the participant is approved for the study, they are scheduled for their first vaccination.Project ACHIEVE and Columbia University are appealing to community members to screen for and join the HVTN 302 trial. As with recent advances in the COVID-19 vaccine development, study participants are essential in furthering the science. Tens of thousands of people have participated in the studies that led to the development of the lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines. As with the COVID-19 vaccine trials, Project ACHIEVE and Columbia University highly encourage those from racial, ethnic and sexual minority communities to participate in the study, as a diverse pool of participants is essential in the success of the study.New York Blood CenterPosted in: Medical Research News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: AIDS, Allergy, Antibodies, Blood, Cancer, Cell, covid-19, Cytoplasm, DNA, Food, Genetic, HIV, HIV/AIDS, Immune System, Infectious Diseases, Laboratory, Muscle, Protein, Research, Ribonucleic Acid, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Spike Protein, Vaccine, VirusCancel reply to commentSonia PonzoIn this interview, we speak to Sonia Ponzo, the Director of Science at Flo Health, about their app and how it's revolutionizing the field of women's health.Linda Boekestijn, Dr. Glauco SouzaIn this interview, News-Medical talks to Dr. Glauco Souza and Linda Boekestijn about their work in the wound healing space and how they devised a new high throughput 3D model for would healing.Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie YeoIn this interview, we speak to Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie Yeo about their new research that looked at using sound waves to regrow bones.\r\r                                              \r                                                    News-Medical.Net provides this medical information service in accordance\r                                                    with these terms and conditions.\r                                                    Please note that medical information found\r                                                    on this website is designed to support, not to replace the relationship\r                                                    between patient and physician/doctor and the medical advice they may provide.\r                                              \r                                              \r\r                                         This site complies with the  HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.News-Medical.net - An AZoNetwork SiteOwned and operated by AZoNetwork, \u00a9 2000-2022"}, {"category": "medical", "title": "Study shows link between psychotropic medication use and post-Covid dementia", "description": "Recent studies have highlighted the connection between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and the development of dementia.", "text": "We use cookies to enhance your experience.

To identify additional factors putting individuals in danger for developing brain impairment, researchers from The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research conducted a first-of-its-kind study that shows a link between the use of psychotropic medication before COVID-19 and post-COVID dementia in older adults (age 65 and older).These findings emphasize the important relationship between preexisting neuropsychiatric conditions, psychotropic medication and post-COVID dementia and may help shed light on future preventative strategies for dementia, an increasingly common and devastating disease. The research, published in Frontiers in Medicine, looked at the electronic health records (EHR) of 1,755 older adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at Northwell Health, the largest health system in New York State, between March 1 and April 20, 2020.A striking 12.7 percent of patients (223) developed dementia within one year of follow-up. Of the 1,755 patients studied, 25 percent (438) were exposed to at least one psychotropic before their COVID diagnosis. Patients who were exposed to a psychotropic medication prior to their COVID diagnosis were almost three times more likely to develop dementia (24 percent vs. 9 percent).\u201cCOVID-19 can have a profound, lingering effect on a person's physical and mental health, particularly in older adults,\u201d said Liron Sinvani, MD, assistant professor in the Institute of Health System Science at the Feinstein Institutes and the senior author of the paper.We know that pre-existing psychiatric illness is associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes, but our study is the first to show an association with certain psychiatric medications and dementia.\u201dLiron Sinvani, MD, Assistant Professor, Institute of Health System Science, Feinstein InstitutesThe medications used by the patients were classified as antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines (for stress/anxiety), mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants and anti-Parkinson disease medications. The research found that antipsychotic medications and mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants were associated with more than a two-fold increased risk of incident post-COVID dementia. Also noted in the paper, delirium during COVID-19 admission was associated with a two-fold increased risk of post-COVID dementia.\u201cThis research shows that psychotropic medications can be considered a predictive risk marker for post-COVID dementia. In patients taking psychotropic medications, COVID-19 could have accelerated progression of dementia after hospitalization,\u201d said Yun Freudenberg-Hua, MD, associate professor in the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry of Northwell Health and in Institute of Molecular Medicine at the Feinstein Institutes, who is also first author on the paper. \u201cIt is important to note that this study is no way recommending people should stop taking antipsychotics, but simply that clinicians need to factor in a patient\u2019s medication history while considering post-COVID after effects.\u201dThis study was done in collaboration with Northwell's Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine. They assembled a research workgroup to focus on COVID-19 and its impact on geriatric patients during the pandemic. The Older Adult COVID Workgroup is part of the Collaboration of Aging and Advanced Illness Research and Education, a research arm which sits within the Department of Medicine. Their work aims to examine geriatrics-relevant factors that significantly impact decisions around medical care and response to treatments. In 2021, the research team published a study in the Journal of Gerontology, which identified older adults presenting to the hospital with atypical COVID-19 symptoms, such as functional decline and altered mental status.\u201cDr. Sinvani and her team continue to shed new light on the impact COVID-19 has on older adults,\" said Kevin J. Tracey, MD, president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes. \"This study and future research may help inform clinicians on the mental health risks certain patients face when recovering from the virus.\u201dThe Feinstein Institutes for Medical ResearchPosted in: Medical Research News | Medical Condition News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: Aging, Anticonvulsants, Antipsychotic, Anxiety, Brain, Coronavirus, covid-19, Delirium, Dementia, Education, Geriatrics, Gerontology, Hospital, Medical Research, Medicine, Mental Health, Mood Stabilizers, Pandemic, Psychiatry, Research, Stress, VirusCancel reply to commentSonia PonzoIn this interview, we speak to Sonia Ponzo, the Director of Science at Flo Health, about their app and how it's revolutionizing the field of women's health.Linda Boekestijn, Dr. Glauco SouzaIn this interview, News-Medical talks to Dr. Glauco Souza and Linda Boekestijn about their work in the wound healing space and how they devised a new high throughput 3D model for would healing.Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie YeoIn this interview, we speak to Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie Yeo about their new research that looked at using sound waves to regrow bones.\r\r                                              \r                                                    News-Medical.Net provides this medical information service in accordance\r                                                    with these terms and conditions.\r                                                    Please note that medical information found\r                                                    on this website is designed to support, not to replace the relationship\r                                                    between patient and physician/doctor and the medical advice they may provide.\r                                              \r                                              \r\r                                         This site complies with the  HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.News-Medical.net - An AZoNetwork SiteOwned and operated by AZoNetwork, \u00a9 2000-2022"}, {"category": "medical", "title": "Groundbreaking chemical technique could reveal new treatments for cancer and other diseases", "description": "Leicester researchers have described application of a pioneering chemical technique which could unlock ground-breaking new treatments for cancer and other diseases.", "text": "We use cookies to enhance your experience.

Our next steps will involve optimizing their chemical structure and biological properties so that one day they could be used to improve the lives of cancer patients.\u201dDr James Hodgkinson, Associate Professor in Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology, University of LeicesterJohn Schwabe is Professor of Structural Biology and Director of the Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, and also a corresponding author on the study.

The team behind it say it should be rolled out nationwide.A decline in mobility associated with aging can greatly reduce quality of life, lead to loss of independence, generate substantial health and social care costs, and reduce overall life expectancy. Pressure on healthcare systems is set to be exacerbated by the rapid expansion of the older population. Currently, three in 10 people of state pension age are classified as disabled due to mobility limitations.REACT \u2013 otherwise known as the REtirement in ACTion program \u2013 is an innovative, behavior change intervention targeted specifically at older adults who are beginning to experience mobility limitations (e.g., those who are beginning to find climbing upstairs, walking to the shop, or getting up from a chair more of a challenge). It aims to prevent further decline in mobility through exercises that target lower limb strength, balance, and stamina.The program focuses on fun, social interaction and building a community through the group-based sessions whilst providing accessible strength, balance, mobility, and cardio-vascular exercises tailored to each participant's needs.Based on results from a large, randomized control trial, the international research team from the universities of Bath, Birmingham, Exeter, and the University of the West of England (UWE) (UK) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine and Wake Forest (US) say that REACT can help older people avoid a downward spiral of declining mobility, which can accelerate and lead to social isolation and loss of independence.Funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) \u2013 Public Health Research program, REACT ran across three sites (Bath / Bristol, Birmingham, and Devon) over four and a half years. It involved 777 participants aged 65 and over (the oldest participant was 98). Participants were split into either an intervention or a control group.Those in the intervention group attended REACT twice a week for three months and then once a week for a further nine months. Those in the control group attended three separate 'healthy ageing' classes over the course of the year. By comparing the two groups, researchers were able to test the effectiveness of REACT on lower limb mobility, as well as looking at health and social care usage.Their results, which are published today [Monday 21 March 2022 \u2013 23.30] in two papers in the Lancet Public Health, show that:Physical activity carries a wide range of benefits for older people including a longer and healthier life, prolonged independence and autonomy, better mobility and improved wellbeing. Yet, many older people face a downward spiral of declining mobility, whereby the less active they are, the more limited they become.\"Afroditi Stathi, Professor and REACT Chief Investigator from the University of Birmingham\"Through REACT we have shown that this steady decline is avoidable. It can be prevented, or in many cases be reversed through an exercise program that is individually tailored and progressive.\"At least one REACT exercise session per week seems sufficient to provide clinically meaningful benefits on lower limb physical function and it is highly cost-effective. This is a strong public health message to give to older adults, both in the UK and around the world.\"Bath-based REACT participant, Mr Fayek Osman, aged 74, said: \"The program improved my wellbeing as my walking ability and stair climbing are improving. REACT has been of great benefit to me and encouraged me to continue with advanced level of activities. It also strengthens my belief that some exercise is better than nothing at all.\"Dr Tristan Snowsill of the University of Exeter, who examined the economic data from the study with Professor Antonieta Medina-Lara, said: \"We found clear evidence that quality of life was improved in the REACT group. This alone would most likely have been enough to justify the cost of the program using the standard rule for cost-effectiveness. To also find that REACT participants used fewer health and care services makes the REACT program one of the clearest cases of value for money I have come across.\"The team now hope REACT can be rolled out nationwide via community activity providers based in local areas.Dr Max Western of the University of Bath's Department for Health explained: \"The aim of REACT was always to have real impacts on people's lives. Given these significant results we are calling on healthcare professionals and policymakers to draw on our findings and implement similar REACT sessions in other parts of the country. Our studies show just how effective REACT can be; we hope many more people will soon be able to benefit from it in the way our participants did.\" Dr Janet Withall, of the University of Birmingham, is the REACT Trial Manager. She added: \"We would like to thank all 777 REACT participants who contributed their time and enthusiasm, and without whom the study would not have been possible. We also could not have conducted the REACT study without all our delivery partners who supported us with their time, resources and expertise.\"University of BathPosted in: Medical Research News | Healthcare NewsTags: Charity, Clinical Trial, Exercise, Health Care, Healthcare, Hospital, Life Expectancy, Medicine, Physical Activity, Public Health, Research, Social Care, Vascular, WalkingCancel reply to commentSonia PonzoIn this interview, we speak to Sonia Ponzo, the Director of Science at Flo Health, about their app and how it's revolutionizing the field of women's health.Linda Boekestijn, Dr. Glauco SouzaIn this interview, News-Medical talks to Dr. Glauco Souza and Linda Boekestijn about their work in the wound healing space and how they devised a new high throughput 3D model for would healing.Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie YeoIn this interview, we speak to Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie Yeo about their new research that looked at using sound waves to regrow bones.\r\r                                              \r                                                    News-Medical.Net provides this medical information service in accordance\r                                                    with these terms and conditions.\r                                                    Please note that medical information found\r                                                    on this website is designed to support, not to replace the relationship\r                                                    between patient and physician/doctor and the medical advice they may provide.\r                                              \r                                              \r\r                                         This site complies with the  HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.News-Medical.net - An AZoNetwork SiteOwned and operated by AZoNetwork, \u00a9 2000-2022"}, {"category": "medical", "title": "New magnetic tentacle robot can reach the smallest bronchial tubes in the lung", "description": "Engineers and scientists have developed proof of concept for a robot that can reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs - to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy.", "text": "We use cookies to enhance your experience.

The next phase of the research will investigate the effectiveness of the device in navigating lungs taken from a cadaver.Currently, doctors use an instrument called a bronchoscope to carry out an examination of the lungs and air passages. The procedure involves passing a flexible tube-like instrument, about 3.5 to 4 millimetres in diameter, through the nose or mouth and into the bronchial passages.Because of its size, the bronchoscope can only travel as far as the upper levels of the bronchial tree.To delve deeper into the lungs, a catheter or fine tube - measuring about 2 millimetres in diameter - is passed through the bronchoscope and then into the smaller tubes of the lungs.But doctors are limited in how they can move a bronchoscope, making it difficult to navigate the instrument and the catheter to where they are needed.The magnetic tentacle robot, however, has been developed to be much more manoeuvrable and uses a robotic guidance system that is personalised for each procedure.A magnetic tentacle robot or catheter that measures 2 millimetres and whose shape can be magnetically controlled to conform to the bronchial tree anatomy can reach most areas of the lung, and would be an important clinical tool in the investigation and treatment of possible lung cancer and other lung diseases. Our system uses an autonomous magnetic guidance system which does away for the need for patients to be X-rayed while the procedure is carried out.\"Pietro Valdastri, Professor and Director of the STORM Lab, University of LeedsTo develop the robotic system, the research team had to overcome two major challenges.Firstly, they had to make a device that was small, flexible and able to navigate the twists and turns of the anatomy of the bronchial tree.Secondly, they needed an autonomous system to guide the magnetic tentacle robot into place, doing away with the need for a doctor to manually manoeuvre an instrument into place, which often involves the patient being exposed to x-rays, and can be technically challenging for medical staff.To reduce the size of the robot while retaining controllability of motion, the researchers manufactured it from a series of interlinked cylindrical segments, each 2 millimetres in diameter and around 80 millimetres in length. The segments were made of a soft elastomeric or rubber-like material which had been impregnated with tiny magnetic particles.Because of the presence of the magnetic particles, the interlinked segments can move somewhat independently under the effect of an external magnetic field. The result is a magnetic tentacle robot which is highly flexible, able to shape shift and small enough to avoid snagging on anatomical structures in the lungs.Magnets mounted on robotic arms on the outside of the patient would be used to guide the device into the lungs in a process that would be tailor-made for each procedure.The route through the bronchial tree is planned from pre-operative scans of a patient's lungs and programmed into the robotic system. As the magnets outside of the patient move, they develop forces on the magnetic particles in the segments of the catheter, causing them to change shape or direction - enabling the robot to be manoeuvred through the lungs and to a site of a suspicious lesion.Once at the target location, the robot is used to take a tissue sample or deliver treatment.It may be several years before \"magnetic tentacle\" technology is available in a hospital setting.The STORM lab at the University of Leeds is revolutionising the technology used in endoscopic and catheter investigations.They have created a protype of a low-cost endoscope - used to investigate the upper gastrointestinal tract - which could be used in low to middle income countries where lack of access to expensive equipment is hampering screening programmes.Magnetic technology is also at the heart of a robotic colonoscopy system that is easier for staff to operate and kinder for patients.The STORM lab is part of the Leeds Centre for Cancer Research which was launched earlier in the year.University of LeedsPosted in: Device / Technology News | Medical Science NewsTags: Anatomy, Cancer, Cancer Therapy, Catheter, Colonoscopy, Doctor, Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal Tract, Heart, Hospital, Laboratory, Lung Cancer, Lungs, Magnetic Field, ResearchCancel reply to commentSonia PonzoIn this interview, we speak to Sonia Ponzo, the Director of Science at Flo Health, about their app and how it's revolutionizing the field of women's health.Linda Boekestijn, Dr. Glauco SouzaIn this interview, News-Medical talks to Dr. Glauco Souza and Linda Boekestijn about their work in the wound healing space and how they devised a new high throughput 3D model for would healing.Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie YeoIn this interview, we speak to Dr. Amy Gelmi and\u00a0Professor Leslie Yeo about their new research that looked at using sound waves to regrow bones.\r\r                                              \r                                                    News-Medical.Net provides this medical information service in accordance\r                                                    with these terms and conditions.\r                                                    Please note that medical information found\r                                                    on this website is designed to support, not to replace the relationship\r                                                    between patient and physician/doctor and the medical advice they may provide.\r                                              \r                                              \r\r                                         This site complies with the  HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.News-Medical.net - An AZoNetwork SiteOwned and operated by AZoNetwork, \u00a9 2000-2022"}, {"category": "medical", "title": "Investigators create specialized, tissue-like structures to model barrier tissues", "description": "Investigators at the Brigham and the Broad Institute have created specialized, tissue-like structures in the laboratory to model barrier tissues, such as the intestines, to identify new targets for treatment.

Barrier tissues are exposed to substances from the outside world but serve as a layer of protection.Over the years, researchers have developed more sophisticated, three-dimensional models of epithelial barrier tissues, such as the intestine. These models are known as intestinal organoids. In a new study, investigators discovered a tissue-modifying molecule that can target intestinal stem cells and signal them to create Paneth cells, a rare but important cell type that can alter the gut microbiota.Previous studies have shown that Paneth cells are depleted in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and graft-versus-host disease. Replenishing these rare cells could represent a new therapeutic pathway. The team's approach could also be used to identify molecules that could target other intestinal cell types.Our paper provides the first approach to engineering our barrier tissues like the intestine by targeting and activating stem cells in situ and causing new important cell types to form. This could be used to potentially treat a wide range of diseases by manipulating the cell composition of the intestine.\"Benjamin Mead, PhD, Study Co-Lead Author, Broad Institute\"This approach has wide ranging implications and can be used to manipulate the cellular makeup of the intestine, including cells that can enhance barrier function, produce gut hormones, or that have key roles in coordinating insulin levels as well as food digestion and absorption,\" said co-corresponding author Jeff Karp, PhD, Distinguished Chair in Clinical Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine. \"This approach also enables a completely new strategy to manipulate gut microbiota and thus offer insights into the treatment of a wide range of diseases.\"Brigham and Women's HospitalMead, B.

In this community-based cohort study, lower left atrial function was associated with higher risk of dementia.\"Dr Lin Yee Chen, Director of the Cardiac Electrophysiology Section, University of Minnesota Medical School and M Health FairviewChen is the principal investigator of the NIH grant that funded this study.The study observed a cohort of 4,096 participants with an average age of 35 years.

Of the cohort, there were 531 participants who developed dementia over a six year period.When comparing the lowest to the highest quintile of left atrial function measures (reservoir strain, conduit strain, and contractile strain), the lowest quintile was significantly associated with 1.5 to 2.0-fold higher risk of developing dementia. These associations were independent of cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation. The research team found that the more common measures of left atrial size were not significantly associated with dementia.\"Results of this epidemiological study improve our understanding of the link between cardiovascular disease and increased risk of dementia,\" said Jacqueline D. Wright, Dr.P.H., a program officer in the division of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. \"This study suggests that atrial myopathy increases risk of dementia, independently of atrial fibrillation.

It would never even have crossed its mind that, 120 million or so years later, scientists would be peering intensely up its clacker.However, that's precisely what scientists did, publishing in 2021 an exquisitely detailed description of a non-avian dinosaur's cloaca: the catch-all hole used for peeing, pooping, mating, and laying eggs.This Swiss Army knife of buttholes is common throughout the animal kingdom today \u2013 all birds, amphibians, reptiles, and even a few mammals possess a cloaca. But we know little about the cloacae of dinosaurs, including their anatomy, what they looked like, and how the animals used them.\"I noticed the cloaca several years ago after we had reconstructed the color patterns of this dinosaur using a remarkable fossil on display at the Senckenberg Museum in Germany which clearly preserves its skin and color patterns,\" paleobiologist Jakob Vinther of the University of Bristol in the UK explained last year.\"It took a long while before we got around to finish it off because no one has ever cared about comparing the exterior of cloacal openings of living animals, so it was largely uncharted territory.\"The Psittacosaurus specimen. (Vinther et al., Current Biology, 2020)So that's what the team did, comparing the fossilized cloaca to modern cloacae.Their specimen was the only non-avian dinosaur fossil known to have a preserved cloaca, but due to the way the fossil was positioned, the internal anatomy of this opening has not been preserved; only the external vent is visible. This means there was a lot of information the researchers couldn't gauge.\"We found the vent does look different in many different groups of tetrapods, but in most cases it doesn't tell you much about an animal's sex,\" said anatomist and animal reproductive system expert Diane Kelly of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\"Those distinguishing features are tucked inside the cloaca, and unfortunately, they're not preserved in this fossil.\"Even so, that exterior anatomy could contain some pretty interesting clues as to what some dinosaur cloacae looked like, and how they were used.Although the dinosaur's cloaca is unlike any other known modern animal, the team was able to identify several features in common with crocodilian reptiles, such as alligators and crocodiles, and birds.There was a dorsal lobe that seemed similar to the cloacal protuberance seen in birds \u2013 a rounded swelling near the cloaca during breeding season, where the male stores sperm \u2013 although, again, without the internal anatomy, it's impossible to say for sure.Secondly, the cloaca had lateral lips on either side of the opening, much like those of crocodilians. Unlike crocodilians however,\u00a0Psittacosaurus\u00a0had them arranged in a V-shape, thus the opening could have been slit-shaped; it also could have been round, like in birds.(Jakob Vinther, University of Bristol and Bob Nicholls/Paleocreations.com 2020)Above:\u00a0The cloacal vent, and how it might once have looked.Other features, however, were also similar to crocodilians. The cloacal lips were covered in small, overlapping scales and heavily pigmented with melanin. In crocodilians, these lobes function as musky scent glands that are used during social displays \u2013 a function, the researchers said, that would be supported by the heavy pigmentation.\"As a paleoartist, it has been absolutely amazing to have an opportunity to reconstruct one of the last remaining features we didn't know anything about in dinosaurs,\" said paleoartist Robert Nicholls.\"Knowing that at least some dinosaurs were signaling to each other gives paleoartists exciting freedom to speculate on a whole variety of now plausible interactions during dinosaur courtship. It is a game changer!\"Because only one fossilized cloaca has been recorded, it's impossible to tell whether the display may have been sexual, and whether the fossilized dinosaur is male or female. But the colorful lobes could hint at the shared ancestry between birds and non-avian dinosaurs, the researchers noted in their paper.Comparison of different cloacae. (Vinther et al., Current Biology, 2020)For lack of samples, this is a very understudied region of dinosaur anatomy, and only by examining a wide range of dinosaur cloacae can we learn more about how they functioned in the social and reproductive lives of these ancient animals.No doubt, other paleontologists are on the lookout for fossilized buttholes to try to fill this gap in our understanding of dinosaur life.The research was published in Current Biology.An earlier version of this article was published in January 2021."}, {"category": "science", "title": "Fish Appear to Be Losing Their

new world.</p>", "text": "Fish communities on Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef may become less colorful as oceans warm and corals bleach, according to a new Australian study that looked at changes in reef health, coral types, and resident fish over three decades. \u00a0\u00a0\"Future reefs may not be the colorful ecosystems we recognize today,\" write marine ecologist Chris Hemingson and his James Cook University colleagues in their paper, published in Global Change Biology.\"Our findings suggest that reefs may be at a critical transition point and might be poised to\u00a0become much less colorful in the coming years.\"The study, which comes weeks after the Great Barrier Reef was struck by another widespread bleaching event fueled by rising carbon emissions, focused on reefs surrounding Orpheus Island, which is located in the mid-section of the largest coral reef system on Earth.Previous coral bleaching events have profoundly changed the make-up of coral reefs in the area, with the loss of soft and branching corals a likely factor in the disappearance of brightly-colored fish, which are becoming increasingly rare, the study found. \u00a0\"As these complex corals become rarer, on future reefs impacted by climate change, fish communities may become duller,\" the trio of researchers writes on their group's website.To investigate, Hemingson and colleagues looked at the diversity of colors found in communities of reef fishes and related that to the types of habitats where those fishes live. \u00a0Whether fishes evolved bright colors to stand out and attract a mate or neutral tones to blend in and avoid predators, their coloration is naturally linked to the coral reefs they inhabit.Fish communities in healthy parts of the reef with plentiful complex corals were compared to other areas where massive, encrusted corals dominate in the wake of major disturbances, such as heatwaves and cyclones, and degraded reefs with few corals smothered in algae.\"We found that as the cover of structurally complex corals increases on a reef, so does the diversity and range of colors present on fishes living in and around them,\" says Hemingson, who focused on small fishes that rarely venture far from their home patch of reef.\"But, as the cover of turf algae and dead coral rubble increases, the diversity of colors declines to a more generalized, uniform appearance.\"(Hemingson et al.,\u00a0Global Change Biology, 2022)Above:\u00a0Fish communities in healthy (a) and damaged (b) parts of the reef.This doesn't bode well for reef fishes in warming waters, so Hemingson and colleagues looked back at data collected annually for the past 27 years on fish communities inhabiting reefs around Orpheus Island, to see whether the trends held true over time.We know from other previous studies that just 2 percent of the Great Barrier Reef remains untouched by the five mass coral bleaching events of the past 30 years \u2013 a truly horrific toll of human-caused, emissions-driven marine heatwaves.The first recorded mass bleaching event of 1998 hit the reefs around Orpheus Island especially hard, damaging complex branching corals and leading to a \"complete shift\" in fish communities, Hemingson and colleagues found.The most eye-catching yellow and green fishes, such as the lemon damselfish and green coral goby, have declined in abundance in the three decades since, by about two-thirds.\"Ongoing declines (exacerbated by further disturbance events) are likely to lead to a complete loss of these brightly colored species,\" which would effectively 'drain' the color out of fish communities, making them dull and drab, Hemingson and his coral reef compadres write.Although the massive and encrusting boulder corals that replaced soft, branching corals are more resilient to heat impacts \u2013 literally hardening the reef to future stressors \u2013 they probably provide less protection from predators for brightly-colored fishes.\"Unfortunately, this means that the corals that are most capable of surviving the immediate impacts of climate change are unlikely to maintain the diversity of colors currently supported by coral reefs,\" the researchers write.\"Fish communities on future reefs are therefore likely to be a duller version of their previous configurations, even if coral cover remains high.\"Hemingson acknowledges the grief that people may feel as fish species and corals are lost \u2013 an ecological grief that scientists studying coral reefs first-hand know all too well.But as scientists have shown with gusto, grief can be a powerful motivational force that spurs people to take action, too.\"I can either give up when I feel upset, or use those emotions to motivate me and find better solutions,\" Emma Camp, a coral biologist at the University of Technology Sydney told Nature in 2019.Fighting words for us all to live by.The study was published in Global Change Biology."},

been tasked with studying a leviathan: Jupiter, the heavyweight of the Solar System, King of the Planets.But a planet the size of Jupiter, nearly 318 times the mass of Earth, isn't without its friends.The gas giant has 79 known moons (and possibly more unknown), one of them even bigger than Mercury. Juno is exploring the relationship between some of those moons and their host planet \u2013 and sometimes, seeing them show up photobombing pictures of the Big Jupe itself.The latest of these is so breathtaking, it almost looks like an artwork of science fiction. Jupiter looms large, its classic bands of roiling, swirling cloud and spot-like cyclones clearly visible on the southern hemisphere in the sunlight.(NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/AndreaLuck)To the right of the giant planet, two relatively small specks sail serenely against the inky darkness. These are two of Jupiter's four Galilean moons \u2013 the largest of its satellites, discovered by Galileo Galilei.The two pictured here are the smaller of the four: Io, with an equatorial diameter of 3,643.2 kilometers (2,264 miles); and Europa, with an equatorial diameter of 3,121.6 kilometers (1,940 miles).(NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/AndreaLuck)Each of these moons is a fascinating target for study in its own right. Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, speckled by over 400 active volcanoes on its surface. These are the result of internal gravitational stresses placed on the moon, not just by Jupiter, but by the three other Galilean moonsThis volcanic activity results in Io's atmosphere becoming rich in sulfur dioxide, spewed out by the volcanoes. That atmosphere constantly leaks, forming a plasma torus around Jupiter itself, which is channeled along magnetic fields lines to rain down onto Jupiter's poles, generating permanent aurorae.The constant spew of sulfur has also coated Io itself in various sulfur compounds, which give the moon its predominantly yellow hue.True-color image of Io. (NASA/JPL/University of Arizona)Europa, meanwhile, is the target of interest in the search for life outside Earth. Beneath its pale, icy shell lurks an interior liquid ocean. Although the moon is far from the Sun, it, too, may be internally heated by gravitational stress.If this is the case, then there may be hydrothermal vents at the floor of its global sea. Here on Earth, such vents are havens for food webs that rely not on photosynthesis, but chemosynthesis to survive: harnessing chemical reactions for food.This has led astrobiologists to believe that, of all the worlds in the Solar System, ice moons like Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus may be the most likely places to find extraterrestrial life.Juno will be making close flybys of these two very different worlds.Europa, which is also the target of a dedicated mission scheduled for a 2024 launch, will be visited by the probe in September of this year. It will be the closest any probe has been to the moon in decades. Io, meanwhile, is scheduled for flybys in late 2023 and early 2024.You can download the full-size version of this image from the NASA website."}, {"category": "science", "title": "Record-Smashing Heatwaves Are Hitting Antarctica And The Arctic at The Same Time", "description": "<img alt=\"Sunset reflection in Antarctic Sound, Antarctica. \" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/AntarcticaSunset_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>What is going on?</p>", "text": "Record-breaking heatwaves hit both Antarctica and the Arctic simultaneously this week, with temperatures reaching 47\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C higher than normal.Heatwaves are bizarre at any time in Antarctica, but particularly now at the equinox as Antarctica is about to descend into winter darkness. Likewise, up north, the Arctic is just emerging from winter.Are these two heatwaves linked? We don't know yet, and it's most likely a coincidence. But we do know weather systems in Antarctica and the Arctic are connected to regions nearest to them, and these connections sometimes reach all the way to the tropics.And is climate change the cause? It might be. While it's too soon to say for sure, we do know climate change is making polar heatwaves more common and severe, and the poles are warming faster than the global average.So let's take a closer look at what's driving the extreme anomalies for each region, and the flow-on effects for polar wildlife like penguins and polar bears.Antarctica's heatwave was driven by a slow, intense high pressure system located southeast of Australia, which carried vast amounts of warm air and moisture deep into Antarctica's interior. It was coupled with a very intense low pressure system over the east Antarctic interior.To make matters worse, cloud cover over the Antarctic ice plateau trapped heat radiating from the surface.Since it's autumn in Antarctica, temperatures in the continent's interior weren't high enough to melt glaciers and the ice cap. But that's not to say large swings in temperature didn't occur.(ClimateReanalyzer.org)Above: Air temperature anomalies across Antarctica at 2 meters\u00a0above the ground for 18 March 2022.For example, Vostok in the middle of the ice plateau hit a provisional high of -17.7\u00b0C (15\u00b0C higher than previous record of -32.6\u00b0C). Concordia, the Italian-French research station also on the high plateau, experienced its highest ever temperature for any month, which was about 40\u00b0C above the March average.The story is very different on the coast as rain fell, which isn't really common for the continent.The rain was driven primarily by an atmospheric river \u2013 a narrow band of moisture collected from warm oceans. Atmospheric rivers are found on the edge of low pressure systems and can move large amounts of water across vast distances, at scales greater than continents.Despite their rarity, atmospheric rivers make an important contribution to the continent's ice sheets, as they dump relatively large amounts of snow. When surface temperatures rise above freezing, rain rather than snow falls over Antarctica.Last Monday (March 14) air temperatures at the Australian Casey Station reached a maximum of -1.9\u00b0C. Two days later, they were more like mid-summer temperatures, reaching a new March maximum of 5.6\u00b0C, which will melt ice.This is the second heatwave at Casey Station in two years. In February 2020, Casey hit 9.2\u00b0C, followed by a shocking high of 18.3\u00b0C on the Antarctic Peninsula.So what might this mean for wildlife?Ad\u00e9lie penguins, which live across the entire Antarctic coastline, have recently finished their summer breeding. But thankfully, the Ad\u00e9lie penguin chicks had already left for sea to start hunting for food on their own, so the heatwave did not impact them.The rain may have affected the local plant life, such as mosses, especially as they were in their annual phase of drying out for the winter. But we won't know if there's any damage to the plants until next summer when we can visit the moss beds again.A similar weather pattern occurred last week in the Arctic. An intense low pressure system began forming off the north-east coast of the United States. An atmospheric river formed at its junction with an adjacent high pressure system.This weather pattern funneled warm air into the Arctic circle. Svalbald, in Norway, recorded a new maximum temperature of 3.9\u00b0C.US researchers called the low pressure system a \"bomb cyclone\" because it formed so rapidly, undergoing the delightfully termed \"bombogenesis\".(ClimateReanalyzer.org)Above: Arctic air temperature anomalies at 2 meters\u00a0above the ground for 17 March 2022.Winter sea ice conditions this year were already very low, and on land there was recent record-breaking rain across Greenland.If the warm conditions cause sea ice to break up earlier than normal, it could have dire impacts for many animals. For example, sea ice is a crucial habitat for polar bears, enabling them to hunt seals and travel long distances.Many people live in the Arctic, including Arctic Indigenous people, and we know losing sea ice disrupts subsistence hunting and cultural practices.What's more, the bomb cyclone weather system brought chaotic weather to many populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere. In northern Norway, for instance, flowers have began blooming early due to three weeks of abnormally warm weather.Modelling suggests large-scale climate patterns are become more variable. This means this seemingly one-off heatwave may be a harbinger for the future under climate change.In particular, the Arctic has been warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. This is because the melting sea ice reveals more ocean beneath, and the ocean absorbs more heat as it's darker.In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects Arctic sea ice to continue its current retreat, with ice-free summers possible by the 2050s.Antarctica's future looks similarly concerning. The IPCC finds global warming between 2\u00a0and 3\u00b0C this century would see the West Antarctic Ice Sheet almost completely lost. Bringing global emissions down to net zero as fast as possible will help avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Dana M Bergstrom, Principal Research Scientist, University of Wollongong; Sharon Robinson, Professor, University of Wollongong, and Simon Alexander, Atmospheric scientist, University of Tasmania.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This year's report, the tenth anniversary of the survey, collected responses from approximately 1,000 respondents in each of the 156 countries that participate.While the ongoing effects of the coronavirus outbreak have undoubtedly brought pain and suffering to many, there has also been an increase in support that people show for each other, and in expressions of benevolence, the study authors report.\"We found during 2021 remarkable worldwide growth in all three acts of kindness monitored in the Gallup World Poll,\" says economist John Helliwell\u00a0from the University of British Columbia in Canada.\"Helping strangers, volunteering, and donations in 2021 were strongly up in every part of the world, reaching levels almost 25 percent above their pre-pandemic prevalence.\"With disease and war continuing to impact wellbeing (the data here was collected before the conflict between Russia and Ukraine), it's a reminder that there is still hope for humanity \u2013 that in times of trial we can come together.\"This surge of benevolence, which was especially great for the helping of strangers, provides powerful evidence that people respond to help others in need, creating in the process more happiness for the beneficiaries, good examples for others to follow, and better lives for themselves,\" Helliwell says.In terms of individual countries, the people of Finland were ranked as the happiest in 2022 \u2013 the fifth year in a row the nation has held the top spot. Denmark came in second, with Iceland, Switzerland and the Netherlands rounding out the top five.The team behind the report suggests high trust, social cohesion, a good work-life balance, and free education and healthcare are the key reasons why the Scandinavian countries rank highly in the report every year.While the positioning hasn't shifted much from last year, the biggest gains in happiness were seen in Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania. The biggest drops in happiness scores were observed in Lebanon and Venezuela, and in Afghanistan, where life continues to be difficult for many since the Taliban regained control in August 2021.\"At the very bottom of the ranking we find societies that suffer from conflict and extreme poverty,\" says economist Jan-Emmanuel De Neve\u00a0from the University of Oxford in the UK.\"Notably we find that people in Afghanistan evaluate the quality of their own lives as merely 2.4 out of 10. This presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims and the fundamental importance of peace and stability for human wellbeing.\"Stress, worry, and sadness have increased overall, the researchers report, with the pandemic in particular having a \"tangible impact\" on lives and happiness. Future concerns are likely to focus around war, rises in the cost of living, and the shifts happening due to the climate crisis.Different attitudes are revealed in different age groups. Among the young, for example, life satisfaction has fallen \u2013 but it has also risen in the over-60s. However, overall there has been a slight long-term decline in the enjoyment of life in most countries.The World Happiness Report is intended to promote happiness and wellbeing as well as report on it. While researchers continue to discover new insights into what makes us happy, our happiness or lack of it still depends largely on environmental factors and what's going on around us.While conflict, disease, poverty, and inequality continue to be major problems in 2022, the researchers suggest there's plenty of potential for taking better care of ourselves, whether that's at the level of governments or individual actions.\"Acts of kindness and generosity can help us cope in difficult times by giving us a sense of purpose, something practical to focus on and showing the strength of the human spirit,\" explains Mark Williamson, CEO of the charity Action for Happiness.\"We can build good mental health by taking positive action to help others.\"\u00a0To see the report in full, check out the World Happiness Report website."}, {"category": "science", "title": "MDMA Shows Promising Results in Phase 3 Clinical Trial For PTSD Treatment", "description": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/CloseUpPinkTabletsWithLetterEOnThem_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>The evidence is in.</p>", "text": "In recent years, scientists have found that psychoactive drugs such as MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, and ketamine show promise in treating various mental health issues. Now, MDMA-assisted therapy has shown more promising results in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).In findings presented at the American Chemical Society's (ACS) Spring Meeting for 2022, researchers report on follow-up results from a phase 3 clinical trial last year where MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy), coupled with therapy, was tested for the treatment of PTSD.The data indicate therapy has been effective even in hard-to-treat patients, such as those with drug or alcohol use disorders.\u00a0\"MDMA is really interesting because it's an empathogen,\" says neuroscientist Jennifer Mitchell\u00a0from\u00a0the University of California, San Francisco.\u00a0\"It causes the release of oxytocin in the brain, which creates feelings of trust and closeness that can really help in a therapeutic setting.\"Researchers enrolled 90 participants with severe PTSD, a condition characterized by amnesia, flashbacks, and nightmares relating to a past traumatic event, in the first phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of MDMA-assisted therapy for treatment of this disorder.\u00a0Previous phase 2 studies determined optimal dosages of the drug, while the phase 3 trial focused on participants attending an eight-hour therapy session after receiving their dose. Participants then received two MDMA-assisted therapy sessions a month apart, in addition to weekly therapy.\u00a0In follow-ups two months after their final MDMA-assisted therapy session, around two thirds of participants no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Conversely, only one-third of participants in the placebo plus therapy condition saw a significant reduction in their PTSD symptoms.Potential negative side effects of the drug such as nausea were minimal, and there was no evidence that participants were forming addictions to the drug.\u00a0Studies on the addictiveness of MDMA have had mixed results, so the apparent lack of addiction in the current study is a cause for optimism.The first treatment option for people with PTSD is usually selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants such as Prozac, which are usually taken on a daily basis, aren't always effective, and can come with a whole host of unpleasant side effects.\u00a0\"The effect size for MDMA-assisted therapy is better than that for the SSRIs that have been investigated, suggesting that MDMA is a far better therapeutic for PTSD,\" Mitchell says.Researchers are currently sourcing participants for a second phase 3 trial, and if similar results are found, they believe MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD could be approved by the FDA for clinical use by 2023.\u00a0A study was also recently completed that investigated whether MDMA-assisted therapy could be effective in groups of people who have proved resistant to traditional PTSD treatment, such as SSRIs or therapy alone.\u00a0\"It definitely appears to be equally effective in people who are usually considered treatment resistant, so we're very excited to think that MDMA-assisted therapy is going to be an effective therapeutic in that hard-to-reach population,\" Mitchell says.While the short-term results are certainly promising, the researchers are now turning their focus to long-term data from the phase 3 trial.\u00a0\"People in the phase 2 trial were better for years,\" Mitchell says.\u00a0\"They seemed to have a new perspective on life and engaged more. As their social skill set built up, they were happier over time.\"\u00a0However, the long-term results from this latest phase 3 trial are less certain, since participants had more severe PTSD symptoms.Mitchell is quick to point out that people with PTSD should not try to self-medicate with MDMA.\"If MDMA is decriminalized, that doesn't mean it's safe,\" she says.\u00a0\u00a0\"It can be a very powerful tool, but it needs to have the right dose in the right context with the right support system.\"While the preliminary results are certainly encouraging, the drug itself cannot be considered a silver bullet in the treatment of PTSD and other disorders. Instead, it becomes a powerful tool for treatment once paired with therapy, as the drug elicits states of mind that make people more receptive to the benefits that therapy can offer.The results were presented at the American Chemical Society's Spring Meeting for 2022."}, {"category": "science", "title": "Scientists Translated a Spiderweb Into Music, And It's Utterly Captivating", "description": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/SpiderWebAtNight_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>Eerie.</p>", "text": "Spiders rely quite significantly on touch to sense the world around them. Their bodies and legs are covered in tiny hairs and slits that can distinguish between different kinds of vibrations.Prey blundering into a web makes a very different vibrational clamor from another spider coming a-wooing, or the stirring of a breeze, for example. Each strand of a web produces a different tone.A few years ago, scientists translated the three-dimensional structure of a spider's web into music, working with artist Tom\u00e1s Saraceno to create an interactive musical instrument, titled Spider's Canvas.The team later refined and built on that previous work, adding an interactive virtual reality component to allow people to enter and interact with the web.This research, the team says, will not only help them better understand the three-dimensional architecture of a spider's web, but may even help us learn the vibrational language of spiders.\"The spider lives in an environment of vibrating strings,\"\u00a0engineer Markus Buehler of MIT explained in 2021. \"They don't see very well, so they sense their world through vibrations, which have different frequencies.\"When you think of a spider's web, you most likely think of the web of an orb weaver: flat, round, with radial spokes around which the spider constructs a spiral net. Most spiderwebs, however, are not of this kind, but built in three dimensions, like sheet webs, tangle webs, and funnel webs, for example.To explore the structure of these kinds of webs, the team housed a tropical tent-web spider (Cyrtophora citricola) in a rectangular enclosure, and waited for it to fill the space with a three-dimensional web. Then they used a sheet laser to illuminate and create high-definition images of 2D cross-sections of the web.A specially developed algorithm then pieced together the 3D architecture of the web from these 2D cross sections. To turn this into music, different sound frequencies were allocated to different strands. The notes thus generated were played in patterns based on the web's structure.They also scanned a web while it was being spun, translating each step of the process into music. This means that the notes change as the structure of the web changes, and the listener can hear the process of the web's construction.Having a record of the step-by-step process means we can also better understand how spiders build a 3D web without support structures \u2013 a skill that could be used for 3D printing, for example.Spider's Canvas allowed audiences to hear the spider music, but the virtual reality, in which users can enter and play strands of the web themselves, adds a whole new layer of experience, the researchers said.\"The virtual reality environment is really intriguing because your ears are going to pick up structural features that you might see but not immediately recognize,\" Buehler explained.\"By hearing it and seeing it at the same time, you can really start to understand the environment the spider lives in.\"This VR environment, with realistic web physics, allows researchers to understand what happens when they mess with parts of the web, too. Stretch a strand, and its tone changes. Break one, and see how that affects the other strands around it.This, too, can help us understand the architecture of a spider's web, and why they are built the way they are.Perhaps most fascinatingly, the work enabled the team to develop an algorithm to identify the types of vibrations of a spider's web, translating them into \"trapped prey\", or \"web under construction\", or \"another spider has arrived with amorous intent\".This, the team said, is groundwork for the development of learning to speak spider \u2013 at least, tropical tent-web spider.\"Now we're trying to generate synthetic signals to basically speak the language of the spider,\" Buehler said.\"If we expose them to certain patterns of rhythms or vibrations, can we affect what they do, and can we begin to communicate with them?

This week, March 21 marked the hugely significant milestone of over 5,000 exoplanets confirmed. To be precise, 5,005 exoplanets are now documented in the NASA exoplanet archive, every one with its own unique characteristics.Each and every one of these exoplanets has appeared in peer-reviewed research, and been observed using multiple detection techniques or methods of analysis.The pickings are rich for follow-up study to learn more about these worlds with new instruments, such as the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope, and upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.\"It's not just a number,\" says astronomer Jessie Christiansen of the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech. \"Each one of them is a new world, a brand-new planet. I get excited about every one because we don't know anything about them.\"The first two worlds ever confirmed, discovered by astronomers Alexander Wolszczan and Dale Frail, were exoplanets 4.3 and 3.9 times the mass of Earth, whirling around a dead star known as a millisecond pulsar, which sends out 'beats' or pulses of radio waves on millisecond timescales.A third exoplanet, much smaller at 0.02 times the mass of Earth, was discovered orbiting the star, since named Lich, in 1994. The exoplanets were named Poltergeist, Phobetor, and Draugr, respectively.The discovery suggested that the galaxy had to be teeming with the things. Pulsars are a type of neutron star: the dead cores of massive stars that have ejected most of their mass, then collapsed under their own gravity. Their formation process is pretty extreme, often involving colossal explosions.\"If you can find planets around a neutron star, planets have to be basically everywhere,\" Wolszczan says. \"The planet production process has to be very robust.\"But there was a catch. The technique used to identify these exoplanets was based on the very regular timing of pulses from the star, which are altered very slightly by the gravitational influence of the orbiting bodies.Alas, this technique is restricted to pulsars; it's unsuitable for main-sequence stars that don't have regular millisecond pulsations.However, when astronomer William Borucki of NASA pioneered the transit method, which observes faint, regular dips in starlight as an exoplanet passes between us and the host star, exoplanet science exploded.The Kepler Space Telescope, launched in 2009, contributed over 3,000 confirmed exoplanets to the list, with another 3,000 candidates waiting in the wings.In addition to the transit method, astronomers can study the gravitational effect exoplanets exert on their host stars. As the objects orbit a mutual center of gravity, a star appears to 'wobble' slightly on the spot, altering the wavelengths of its light.In addition, if you know the mass of the star, you can study how much it wobbles to infer the mass of the exoplanet; and, if you know how intrinsically bright a star is, you can infer the size of the exoplanet.This is how we know that there are exoplanets out there in the Universe very, very different from those we have in our own home system.Hot Jupiters are enormous gas giants on incredibly close orbits around their stars, the proximity resulting in exoplanet temperatures that can be even hotter than some stars.Mini Neptunes inhabit the size and mass regime between Earth and Neptune, and could potentially be habitable. There are also\u00a0super Earths, which are rocky like Earth, but up to a few times the mass.Because studying exoplanets directly is very hard \u2013 they are small, very dim, very far away, and often very close to a bright star whose light drowns out anything the exoplanet might reflect \u2013 there's still a lot we don't know. There are also still a lot of worlds out there beyond our current detection thresholds.But in the years ahead, those thresholds will retreat against the advance of technology and new analysis techniques, and we may find a variety of worlds beyond our wackiest dreams. Maybe we'll even find traces of life outside the Solar System.\"I get a real feeling of satisfaction, and really of awe at what's out there,\" Borucki says.\"None of us expected this enormous variety of planetary systems and stars. It's just amazing.\""}, {"category": "science", "title": "Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Aftermath Was Even More Brutal Than We Realized", "description": "<img alt=\"A T. rex chick shivers in the cold \" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/DinosaurSulfurWinterSnow_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>The long winter.</p>", "text": "When the dinosaur-destroying asteroid collided with Earth 66 million years ago, massive amounts of sulfur \u2013 volumes more than were previously thought \u2013 were thrown high above land into the stratosphere, a new study finds.Once airborne, this vast cloud of sulfur-bearing gases blocked the Sun and cooled Earth for decades to centuries, then fell down as lethal acid rain on Earth, changing the chemistry of the oceans for tens of thousands of years, which is longer than previously thought, the study found.The findings show that \"we've underestimated the amount of this sulfur that this asteroid impact created,\" study co-researcher James Witts, a lecturer in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol in the UK, told Live Science.As a result, \"the climate change that was associated with it was much greater perhaps than we thought previously\".The fact that sulfur continued pouring down on Earth's surface for so long may help explain why it took so long for life, especially marine life, to recover, as some of the sulfur that fell onto the land would have then washed away into the oceans, Witts said.Related: What happened when the dinosaur-killing asteroid slammed into Earth?The researchers' finding was completely serendipitous. \"It was not something that was planned at all,\" Witts said.The team had originally planned to study the geochemistry of ancient shells near the Brazos River in Falls County, Texas \u2013 a unique place that was underwater during the end-Cretaceous extinction, when the non-avian dinosaurs died out.It's also not too far from the Chicxulub crater in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where the 6-mile-wide (10 kilometers) asteroid struck.The researchers took a few sediment samples at the site, which they hadn't planned on doing.These samples were brought to the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where study co-researcher Aubrey Zerkle, a geochemist and geobiologist, analyzed the different sulfur isotopes, or variations of sulfur that have a different number of neutrons in their nuclei.The researchers found \"a very unusual signal\" \u2013 the sulfur isotopes had unexpected tiny changes to their masses, Witts said. Such mass changes occur when sulfur enters the atmosphere and interacts with ultraviolet (UV) light.\"That can really only happen in two scenarios: either in an atmosphere that doesn't have any oxygen in it or when you have so much sulfur, it's gone really high up into an oxygenated atmosphere,\" Witts said.Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and it has been enveloped by an oxygenated atmosphere since about 2.3 billion years ago.\"We're the first people to see this sort of thing in much more recent times,\" at least in sediments that aren't on the Earth's poles, Witts said.(That's because volcanic eruptions release sulfur high into the atmosphere, which can mix with snow and end up in high concentrations in ice cores at the poles, where there is no other sulfur or sulfate to dilute the signal, Witts said.)\"You don't see [this signal] in marine rocks,\" he said. \"The sea has its own isotopic signature which totally dilutes the tiny amount of sulfur from these volcanoes.\"The fact that this signal is present in marine rock from the Cretaceous shows that, \"there must have been a heck of a lot of sulfur in the atmosphere after this impact event,\" Witts said.\"And that, of course, has a huge implication for climate change related to the impact because sulfur aerosols, we know from modern volcanic eruptions, cause cooling.\"A lot of the sulfur came from the sulfur-rich limestone at the Yucatan Peninsula.\"If the asteroid had hit somewhere else, perhaps there wouldn't have been as much sulfur released into the atmosphere and the climate change that followed might not have been as severe,\" Witts said. \"And therefore the extinction event might not have been so bad.\"Previous estimates of the sulfur aerosols entering Earth's atmosphere after the asteroid impact range from about 30 to 500 gigatons; according to climate models, this sulfur would have turned into sulfate aerosols, which would have caused 3.6 to 14.4 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 8 degrees Celsius) cooling of the Earth's surface for a few decades after the impact.But the new finding suggests that because the sulfur amount was higher, the climate change could have been even more severe.The study was published online Monday (March 21) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Related content:The 5 mass extinction events that shaped the history of Earth10 extraordinary dinosaur discoveries from 2021Photos: Dinosaur tracks reveal Australia's 'Jurassic Park'This article was originally published by Live Science.

As we do so, our brains receive the input \u2013 and depending on what the object of our gaze is, it turns out the brain activity triggered can be quite unique.\"While we typically do not perceive our own eye movements, the abrupt change in visual input with each saccade has substantial consequences at the neuronal level,\" researchers explain in a new study led by first author and cognitive neuroscientist Tobias Staudigl from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany.In an experiment, Staudigl and fellow researchers worked with 13 epilepsy patients, who had electrodes implanted in their brains to monitor their condition. This kind of intervention can be helpful for brain scientists, so they often turn to such patients with electrodes already implanted, in case they'd be willing to volunteer their time.Thus, the patients consented to take part in a study in which they were instructed to freely view a range of visual stimuli displayed on a screen, including images of human faces, monkey faces, and also non-face imagery (pictures of flowers, fruit, cars, and so on).While they were doing this, a camera-based eye-tracking system monitored what objects their eyes were looking at, and the electrodes simultaneously monitored neural activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus \u2013 distinct parts of the brain that are both involved with different aspects of processing memories, amongst other functions, with the amygdala also important for regulating our emotions.(Pikovit44/Getty Images)When the participants looked at human faces, neurons fired and synchronized between the amygdala and the hippocampus in a specific pattern that was different to the results from the other stimuli \u2013 which the team interprets as evidence of how the brain handles memory encoding for important social information, distinct from other non-social objects.\"You could easily argue that faces are one of the most important objects we look at,\" says senior author of the study, Ueli Rutishauser, the director of the neuroscience research at nonprofit healthcare and research organization Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.\"We make a lot of highly significant decisions based on looking at faces, including whether we trust somebody, whether the other person is happy or angry, or whether we have seen this person before.\"The foundations for those decisions have to start somewhere, and the researchers say the process can be seen beginning in the rapid adjustments of saccadic eye movements.It's long been known that seeing faces makes neurons fire in the amygdala more so than for other forms of stimuli, although the reasons for this have remained uncertain.\"One hypothesis is that these signals are transferred from the amygdala via strong projections to the hippocampus, where they elevate and prioritize hippocampal processing of stimuli with high social and emotional significance,\" the researchers write.\"This may serve hippocampal memory encoding for salient stimuli and events.\"That could be what we're seeing here, with the researchers noting that the proportion of cells that were visually selective for human faces was substantially larger in the amygdala than in the hippocampus, suggesting that the amygdala plays a more important frontline role in identifying social stimuli in the first instance.\"We think that this is a reflection of the amygdala preparing the hippocampus to receive new socially relevant information that will be important to remember,\" Rutishauser says.Another key finding was that long-distance communication between different parts of the brain was increased when social stimuli were present.\"When a fixation on a human face followed a saccade, neural communication between the amygdala and hippocampus was enhanced,\" the researchers write. \"The same effect was not observed for saccades and fixations that landed on other stimuli.\"However, when the participants looked at human faces they had already seen earlier in the experiment, the neuron-firing pattern in the amygdala appeared more slowly \u2013 suggesting learned and familiar faces don't spark the same level of neural excitement as new social stimuli.The findings are reported in Science Advances."}, {"category": "science", "title": "Enormous Ice Wall Blocked Ancient Entry Into The Americas, Study Suggests", "description": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/IcyCliffsProtudingFromAGlacier_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>Taller than any building on Earth.</p>", "text": "An icy barrier up to 300 stories high \u2013 taller than any building on Earth \u2013 may have prevented the first people from entering the New World over the land bridge that once connected Asia with the Americas, a new study has found.These findings suggest that the first people in the Americas instead arrived via boats along the Pacific coast, researchers said.There are two main hypotheses as to how people first migrated to North America. The older idea suggested that people made this journey when Beringia \u2013 the landmass that once connected Asia with North America, now divided by the Bering Strait \u2013 was relatively free of ice.The more recent notion suggested that travelers made their way on watercraft along the Pacific coasts of Asia, Beringia, and North America.\u00a0A major factor influencing the way in which the first Americans arrived were giant ice sheets that once blanketed North America. Previous research suggested that an ice-free corridor between the margins of these ice sheets may have enabled travel from Beringia down to the Great Plains.Based on stone tools dating back as much as 13,400 years, archaeologists had long suggested that people from the prehistoric culture known as the Clovis were the first to migrate from Asia to the Americas. Prior work regarding the age of the ice-free corridor suggested it might have served as the migration route for Clovis people.However, scientists have recently unearthed a great deal of evidence of a pre-Clovis presence in North America. For example, in 2021, 60 ancient footprints in New Mexico suggested humans were there about 23,000 years ago, and in 2020, archaeologists discovered stone artifacts in central Mexico that were at least 26,500 years old.Related:\u00a0In photos: The Clovis culture & stone tools\u00a0Recent estimates suggested the ice-free corridor did not open until about 14,000 to 15,000 years ago, which would mean that the earliest Americans may have relied on a coastal route instead of an overland one. Still, a great deal of uncertainty remained when it came to the age of the ice-free corridor.\u00a0To help solve this mystery, researchers sought to pinpoint when the ice-free corridor opened. They investigated 64 geological samples taken from six locations spanning 745 miles (1,200 kilometers) along the zone where the ice-free corridor was thought to have existed.The scientists examined boulders that glaciers once carried far from their original homes, much as rivers might wash pebbles down riverbeds over time.They analyzed how long these rocks were exposed on Earth's surface \u2013 and thus how long they sat on ice-free ground \u2013 by looking at levels of radioactive elements that generated when the rocks were bombarded by high-energy rays from space.The new findings suggest that the ice-free corridor did not fully open until about 13,800 years ago, and the ice sheets \"may have been 1,500 to 3,000 feet (455 to 910 m) high in the area where they covered the ice-free corridor,\" study lead author Jorie Clark, a geologist and archaeologist at Oregon State University, told Live Science.By comparison, the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, stands about 2,722 feet (829.8 m) high.\"This is a very nicely executed study which tackles a long-standing question,\" Matthew Bennett, a researcher who studies trace fossils at Bournemouth University in England and who did not take part in this work, told Live Science.\"The results are interesting and help add to our understanding of this potential migration route. The authors are to be commended on a great bit of science.\"All in all, \"we now have robust evidence that the ice-free corridor was not open and available for the first peopling of the Americas,\" Clark said. Still, \"there is still a lot to learn about whether they actually did come down the coastal route, and if so, how did they travel. We need to find archaeological sites from the area.\"After the first wave of migration and once the ice-free corridor opened, other migration waves may have taken that more direct route, Clark noted. \"But again, we need to find archaeological sites in the ice-free corridor to evaluate when they came down.\"John Hoffecker, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who did not participate in this study, pointed out that the earliest signs of people in the Americas may reveal that humans were present there when both coastal and interior routes to North America were blocked by ice.If true, \"the simplest explanation is that they followed an interior route through the wide ice-free corridor that was present before 30,000 years ago,\" he told Live Science.The scientists detailed\u00a0their findings\u00a0online March 21 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Related content:The 25 most mysterious archaeological finds on EarthIn photos: New Clovis site in SonoraIn Photos: Human Skeleton Sheds Light on First AmericansThis article was originally published by Live Science.

The rings were unlike anything seen before, and we had no idea what they were.We dubbed them odd radio circles, or ORCs. They continue to puzzle us, but new data from South Africa's MeerKAT telescope are helping us solve the mystery.We can now see each ORC is centered on a galaxy too faint to be detected earlier. The circles are most likely enormous explosions of hot gas, about a million light years across, emanating from the central galaxy.Our paper showing these results has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication by Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.We now have beautiful images of one of these rings taken with South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope, which shows the ORC in stunning detail.(Jayanne English/MeerKAT/Dark Energy Survey.)Above: MeerKAT (green/grey) image of the odd radio circle ORC1 superimposed on an optical image from the Dark Energy Survey.For example, MeerKAT sees a small blob of radio emission in the centre of the ring, which is coincident with a distant galaxy. We are now fairly certain this galaxy generated the ORC.We see these central galaxies in other ORCs too, all at vast distances from Earth. We now think that these rings surround distant galaxies about a billion light-years away, which means the rings are enormous \u2013 around a million light-years across.From modeling the faint cloudy radio emission that MeerKAT detects within the rings, it seems the rings are the edges of a spherical shell surrounding the galaxy, like a blast wave from a giant explosion in the galaxy.They look like rings instead of orbs only because the sphere appears brighter at the edges where there is more material along the line of sight, much like a soap bubble.Above: Artist's impression of odd radio circles exploding from a central galaxy. It is thought to take the rings 1 billion years to reach the size we see them today. The rings are so big (millions of light-years across), they've expanded past other galaxies. (Sam Moorfield/CSIRO)MeerKAT has also mapped the polarization of the radio waves, which tells us about the magnetic field in the ring. Our polarization image shows a magnetic field running along the edge of the sphere.This suggests that an explosion in the central galaxy caused a hot blast to collide with the tenuous gas outside the galaxy. The resulting shock wave then energized electrons in the gas, making them spiral around the magnetic field, generating radio waves.(Larry Rudnick/MeerKAT data)ABOVE: Lines around the edge of the ORC show the direction of the magnetic field. A circular magnetic field like this indicates it has been compressed by a shock wave from the central galaxy.One big surprise from the MeerKAT result is that within the ring we see several curved filaments of radio emission. We still don't know what these are.But we do know that the sphere is so huge that it has swallowed up other galaxies as it blasted out from the central galaxy. Perhaps the filaments are trails of gas ripped off the galaxies by the passing shock wave?The big question, of course, is what caused the explosion. We are exploring two possibilities.One is that they were caused by the merging of two supermassive black holes. Such a \"merger event\" releases an enormous amount of energy, enough to generate the ORC.Another possibility is that the central galaxy went through a \"starburst\" event, in which millions of stars were suddenly born from the gas in the galaxy. Such a starburst causes hot gas to blast out from the galaxy, causing a spherical shock wave.Both black hole mergers and starburst events are rare, which accounts for why ORCs are so rare (only five have so far been reported).The puzzle of ORCs is not solved yet, and we still have much to learn about these mysterious rings in the sky. So far, we have only detected them with radio telescopes \u2013 we see nothing from the rings at optical, infrared, or X-ray wavelengths.To find out more, we need a tool even more sensitive than MeerKAT and ASKAP. Fortunately, the global astronomical community is building just such an observatory \u2013 the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), an international effort with telescopes in South Africa and Australia.ASKAP and MeerKAT were built to test the sites and technology for the SKA. Quite apart from their role as precursors for the SKA, both telescopes have been hugely successful in their own right, making major discoveries in their first years of operation.Their success in discovering and studying ORCs therefore bodes well for the SKA.The two telescopes are also beautifully complementary \u2013 ASKAP is superb at surveying large areas of sky and finding new objects, while MeerKAT is unrivaled for zooming in on those objects and studying them with higher sensitivity and resolution.The SKA promises to surpass both.

This makes sense, as most misophonia-triggering sounds are caused by actions involving the human face \u2013 such as chewing or breathing.As a result of the findings, the researchers have a suggestion: People with misophonia are actually experiencing a stimulation of the same part of the motor cortex that is causing the triggering sound from someone else.\"Our findings indicate that for people with misophonia there is abnormal communication between the auditory and motor brain regions,\" said neuroscientist Sukhbinder Kumar, from Newcastle University in the UK.\"You could describe it as a 'super-sensitized connection'. This is the first time such a connection in the brain has been identified for the condition.\"The team analyzed fMRI brain scans from a total of 75 people with and without misophonia to discover this super-sensitized connection. Data was collected with no noise, with misophonia trigger sounds (like chewing), with sounds designed to be unpleasant to everyone (like screaming), and with neutral sounds (like rainfall).The researchers made an additional discovery too: a stronger connection between the motor cortex and the visual cortex. This gives us more clues about what might be setting off misophonia in the brain.\"What surprised us was that we also found a similar pattern of communication between the visual and motor regions, which reflects that misophonia can also occur when triggered by something visual,\" said Kumar.\"This leads us to believe that this communication activates something called the 'mirror system', which helps us process movements made by other individuals by activating our own brain in a similar way \u2013 as if we were making that movement ourselves.\"This mirror neuron system, which has been previously studied, is thought to work in the same way inside the brain whether we're actually doing something or watching someone else do it. The researchers suggested that misophonia is so uncomfortable because it feels like an intrusion into the brain when this mirroring happens.That idea is backed up by one of the ways misophonia can be managed in some people: by mimicking the action creating the trigger sound and thus taking back control. If we can better understand how that works, we could improve our approaches to managing misophonia, which can have a seriously negative impact on people's day-to-day lives.Between 6 to 20 percent of the population are thought to be living with some form of misophonia, but there's still plenty about it that we don't understand. In its most severe form, it can make some work, family and social situations almost intolerable.\"The study provides new ways to think about the treatment options for misophonia,\" neurologist Tim Griffiths, from Newcastle University, said last year.\"Instead of focussing on sound centers in the brain, which many existing therapies do, effective therapies should consider motor areas of the brain as well.\"The research was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.A version of this article was originally published in May 2021."}, {"category": "science", "title": "Physicists Just Discovered a Weird New Tetragonal Phase of Water Ice", "description": "<img alt=\"The diamond anvil used to squash the sample. \" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/diamond-anvil-for-pressurising-water-ice_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>Literally cool!</p>", "text": "A new crystalline form of water ice has been discovered in fleeting transitions between phases at high pressures.It's called Ice-VIIt, and it takes place as the substance slides between two already known, cubic arrangements of molecules.\u00a0Although it's unlikely Ice-VIIt would naturally appear on Earth's surface, it could reveal more about how water behaves on massive alien worlds.We might think it commonplace, but water is actually pretty weird\u00a0compared to other liquids we know. The arrangement of molecules within water's frozen form \u2013 ice \u2013 can vary significantly, depending on the conditions around it.We know of at least 19 of these solid phases of ice, some of which occur naturally, some of which have only been seen in laboratory conditions.The ice you see in the freezer, or falling from the sky as snowflakes or hailstones, is the most common natural ice on Earth. It is called Ice-I, with oxygen atoms arranged in a hexagonal grid. The structure is, however, geometrically frustrated, with the hydrogen atoms hanging about in a disorderly fashion.When physicists cool Ice-I at various temperatures and apply different pressures to it, the hydrogen and oxygen atoms within can periodically reach different arrangements, sometimes even ordering themselves more neatly. These various forms of water ice are not always stable, but we can explore these in the lab to reveal their curious molecular structures.Two of these phases that have cubic structures are Ice-VII, which has disordered hydrogen, and Ice-X, which is symmetric. These can be reached by subjecting ice to high pressures tens to hundreds of thousands greater than Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level, Ice-VII at even lower pressures than Ice-X.To study the transitions between ice phases, a team of physicists led by Zach Grande of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas performed experiments on high pressure ice using a new technique to measure the properties of the ice as pressure was applied.\u00a0The researchers squeezed a sample of water in a diamond anvil, forcing it to freeze in a jumble of crystals. Lasers were used to then heat the sample, causing it to melt before re-freezing into what the researchers described as a powder-like collection of crystals.By incrementally raising the pressure in the anvil, with periodic blasts from the laser, the researchers created Ice-VII, and observed the transition to Ice-X. In between, thanks to their new measurement technique, they also observed the new intermediate phase, Ice-VIIt.In this phase, the cubic lattice of Ice-VII is stretched along one of its vectors so that the structure extends into a rectangular arrangement, with a cubic footprint, before settling into the symmetric, fully ordered cubic arrangement of Ice-X. This arrangement is known as tetragonal.The team also showed that Ice-X can form at much lower pressures than previously thought. Ice-VII forms from approximately 3 gigapascals; that is, 30,000 atmospheric pressures. According to the team's observations, the transition to Ice-VIIt occurs at around 5.1 gigapascals.Previous reports have put the transition pressure for Ice-X between 40 and 120 gigapascals. However, Grande and his team observed the transition between Ice-VIIt and Ice-X occurring at around 30.9 gigapascals.This, the team said, should help resolve the debate about the Ice-X transition pressure.\"Zach's work has demonstrated that this transformation to an ionic state occurs at much, much lower pressures than ever thought before,\" said physicist Ashkan Salamat of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\"It's the missing piece, and the most precise measurements ever on water at these conditions.\"This, the team said, could have important implications for studying the interior conditions of other worlds. Water-rich planets outside the Solar System could, they said, have Ice-VIIt in abundance, even increasing the chance of conditions suitable for the emergence of life.The team's research has been published in Physical Review B."}, {"category": "science", "title": "Here's How a Large-Enough Solar Storm Could Completely Change The World", "description": "<img alt=\"Not our actual distance to the Sun. \" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/DistantSunLashingCloserEarthWithPlasma_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>They've happened before.</p>", "text": "On Sept. 1 and 2, 1859, telegraph systems around the world failed catastrophically. The operators of the telegraphs reported receiving electrical shocks, telegraph paper catching fire, and being able to operate equipment with batteries disconnected.During the evenings, the aurora borealis, more commonly known as the northern lights, could be seen as far south as Colombia. Typically, these lights are only visible at higher latitudes, in northern Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia.What the world experienced that day, now known as the Carrington Event, was a massive geomagnetic storm. These storms occur when a large bubble of superheated gas called plasma is ejected from the surface of the sun and hits the Earth. This bubble is known as a coronal mass ejection.The plasma of a coronal mass ejection consists of a cloud of protons and electrons, which are electrically charged particles. When these particles reach the Earth, they interact with the magnetic field that surrounds the planet.This interaction causes the magnetic field to distort and weaken, which in turn leads to the strange behavior of the aurora borealis and other natural phenomena. As an electrical engineer who specializes in the power grid, I study how geomagnetic storms also threaten to cause power and internet outages and how to protect against that.The Carrington Event of 1859 is the largest recorded account of a geomagnetic storm, but it is not an isolated event.Geomagnetic storms have been recorded since the early 19th century, and scientific data from Antarctic ice core samples has shown evidence of an even more massive geomagnetic storm that occurred around 774\u00a0CE, now known as the Miyake Event. That solar flare produced the largest and fastest rise in carbon-14 ever recorded. Geomagnetic storms trigger high amounts of cosmic rays in Earth's upper atmosphere, which in turn produce carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon.A geomagnetic storm 60 percent smaller than the Miyake Event occurred around 993 CE. Ice core samples have shown evidence that large-scale geomagnetic storms with similar intensities as the Miyake and Carrington events occur at an average rate of once every 500 years.Nowadays the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration uses the Geomagnetic Storms scale to measure the strength of these solar eruptions. The \"G scale\" has a rating from 1 to 5 with G1 being minor and G5 being extreme. The Carrington Event would have been rated G5.It gets even scarier when you compare the Carrington Event with the Miyake Event. Scientist were able to estimate the strength of the Carrington Event based on the fluctuations of Earth's magnetic field as recorded by observatories at the time. There was no way to measure the magnetic fluctuation of the Miyake event. Instead, scientists measured the increase in carbon-14 in tree rings from that time period.The Miyake Event produced a 12 percent increase in carbon-14. By comparison, the Carrington Event produced less than 1 percent increase in Carbon-14, so the Miyake Event likely dwarfed the G5 Carrington Event.Today, a geomagnetic storm of the same intensity as the Carrington Event would affect far more than telegraph wires and could be catastrophic. With the ever-growing dependency on electricity and emerging technology, any disruption could lead to trillions of dollars of monetary loss and risk to life dependent on the systems. The storm would affect a majority of the electrical systems that people use every day.Geomagnetic storms generate induced currents, which flow through the electrical grid. The geomagnetically induced currents, which can be in excess of 100 amperes, flow into the electrical components connected to the grid, such as transformers, relays and sensors.One hundred amperes is equivalent to the electrical service provided to many households. Currents this size can cause internal damage in the components, leading to large scale power outages.A geomagnetic storm three times smaller than the Carrington Event occurred in Quebec, Canada, in March 1989. The storm caused the Hydro-Quebec electrical grid to collapse.During the storm, the high magnetically induced currents damaged a transformer in New Jersey and tripped the grid's circuit breakers. In this case, the outage led to five million people being without power for nine hours.In addition to electrical failures, communications would be disrupted on a worldwide scale. Internet service providers could go down, which in turn would take out the ability of different systems to communicate with each other. High-frequency communication systems such as ground-to-air, shortwave and ship-to-shore radio would be disrupted.Satellites in orbit around the Earth could be damaged by induced currents from the geomagnetic storm burning out their circuit boards. This would lead to disruptions in satellite-based telephone, internet, radio and television.Also, as geomagnetic storms hit the Earth, the increase in solar activity causes the atmosphere to expand outward. This expansion changes the density of the atmosphere where satellites are orbiting. Higher density atmosphere creates drag on a satellite, which slows it down. And if it isn't maneuvered to a higher orbit, it can fall back to Earth.One other area of disruption that would potentially affect everyday life is navigation systems. Virtually every mode of transportation, from cars to airplanes, use GPS for navigation and tracking. Even handheld devices such as cell phones, smart watches and tracking tags rely on GPS signals sent from satellites.Military systems are heavily dependent on GPS for coordination. Other military detection systems such as over-the-horizon radar and submarine detection systems could be disrupted, which would hamper national defense.In terms of the internet, a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the Carrington Event could produce geomagnetically induced currents in the submarine and terrestrial cables that form the backbone of the internet as well as the data centers that store and process everything from email and text messages to scientific data sets and artificial intelligence tools. This would potentially disrupt the entire network and prevent the servers from connecting to each other.It is only a matter of time before the Earth is hit by another geomagnetic storm. A Carrington Event-size storm would be extremely damaging to the electrical and communication systems worldwide with outages lasting into the weeks.If the storm is the size of the Miyake Event, the results would be catastrophic for the world with potential outages lasting months if not longer. Even with space weather warnings from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the world would have only a few minutes to a few hours notice.I believe it is critical to continue researching ways to protect electrical systems against the effects of geomagnetic storms, for example by installing devices that can shield vulnerable equipment like transformers and by developing strategies for adjusting grid loads when solar storms are about to hit. In short, it's important to work now to minimize the disruptions from the next Carrington Event.

(Jason Quinlan/\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck Research Project)One of the most obvious: \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck had no streets. Dwellings were constructed directly alongside each other, so that the only way to enter buildings was to climb down into them from the rooftop.Once inside, even if nobody was around, you were not alone. The people of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck buried their dead inside their homes, underneath the floor.\"Adults were most often placed in a flexed position, located beneath the northern and eastern platforms of the central room,\" a team of researchers, led by first author and archaeo-anthropologist Eline Schotsmans from the Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux in France, explains in a new study analyzing the funerary practices of ancient \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck.\"Perinate, neonate, and infants were buried in more variable locations within the house.\"Burial placement wasn't the only custom unusual by our modern Western standards. \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck's skeletons were sometimes ritualistically painted before burial, although much has remained unknown about the specifics of the pigments used \u2013 and the symbolism of their colorings.In the new study, Schotsmans and fellow researchers examined the skeletal remains of former \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck individuals, over 800 of whom have been excavated since the early 1990s; the team also analyzed the pigments used on them (or on associated burial items) with an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer.Detail of cinnabar stripe on cranium of male individual. (Marco Milella)Ultimately, only a small minority of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck's dead (about 6 percent of the individuals studied here) were directly treated with pigments, while 11 percent featured pigment on grave items buried with the deceased, such as stained shells, bowls, baskets, and bone objects.Pigments applied to skeletal remains were always red in color (usually on the cranium), with red ochre being the most commonly used pigment. More males than females received direct treatment with pigment, and adults were also slightly more likely than children to be painted.Less common pigments seem to have reflected the social identity of the deceased, the researchers observe, with cinnabar (a red form of mercury sulfide) reserved largely for males, and either directly painted onto bone, or absorbed from red headbands the men wore while alive or when buried after death.Meanwhile, blue and green pigments on burial items were solely limited to females and children.\"These colors have sometimes been associated with concepts of growth, fertility, and ripeness, which are abstractions that could be related to the transition to agriculture,\" the researchers write, although they note that the limited sample size of the colorants found so far limits our ability to interpret the discoveries.What is clear, however, is that there's some kind of link between the numbers of burials within a dwelling and layers of painting found on the walls above the grave.\"This means: when they buried someone, they also painted on the walls of the house\",\u00a0says\u00a0senior researcher and anthropologist Marco Milella from the University of Bern in Switzerland.Geometric wall painting inside building.

Among the human remains found in the ancient city, some have never been disturbed since Neolithic times, while others were interfered with by subsequent Neolithic activity, with evidence of disarticulated skeletons or isolated bones.This could potentially mean that skeletal elements were sometimes dug up in ancient \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, with the bones of deceased individuals serving some form of symbolic role in the community, before later being buried again.\"Other individuals, either as complete bodies or loose skeletal elements, remained in the community,\" the researchers write.\"These circulating skeletal elements were eventually deposited in secondary or tertiary deposition contexts, which may also have been linked to the creation of architectural paintings in an indirect way.\"As for what purpose this served, it's impossible to know for sure, but the researchers say the continued use of excavated human remains within the community could have been a way of keeping the memory of those people alive, in a manner of speaking.\"According to socio-cultural anthropologists, collective memory is handed down from generation to generation through repetition of past actions and by direct object-to-memory association,\" the researchers explain.\"Intramural burials may have been a part of processes of memory retention with each interment contributing to communal memory by keeping the deceased close to the daily rhythm of repeated household activities.\"The findings are published in Scientific Reports."}, {"category": "science", "title": "Lose Yourself in This Mesmerizing New Pic of a 'Grand Design' Galaxy", "description": "<img alt=\"NGC 4254 in multiple wavelengths, imaged by MUSE. \" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/ngc-4254-muse-multi-wavelength-header_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>A sight for sore eyes.</p>", "text": "A new image shows a breathtaking galaxy as you have never seen it before.Not only is the image absolutely spectacular, it's scientifically valuable: By studying the galaxy's light across multiple wavelengths, scientists can gain a better understanding of star formation and evolution processes.The galaxy in question is an object called NGC 4254, or Messier 99; the new capture reveals it across multiple spectra of light, thanks to the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on ESO's Very Large Telescope.All galaxies are special, but NGC 4254, located around 50 million light-years from the Milky Way, belongs to a subset deemed spectacular among spectacular, like an albino peacock: a \"grand design\" spiral galaxy.This is a spiral galaxy with prominent, well-formed and visible spiral arms; almost the platonic ideal of what a spiral galaxy should look like, unlike a flocculent spiral galaxy, with fluffy, patchy and broken arms.Hubble's visible light image of NCG 4254.

A Doctor Explains The Risks", "description": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022-03/processed/WomanHoldingRedSupplementGummiesInHand_1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /><p>It's not 'just' a supplement.</p>", "text": "I have been a doctor for over 20 years, 12 of which were dedicated exclusively to the practice of sleep medicine. Over the years, I have seen an enormous increase in the use of melatonin by my patients and their families. Although melatonin has helped many of my patients, there are some concerns that I have that are worth sharing.First, I am not sure most of my patients that took melatonin before my clinical evaluation knew exactly what melatonin was. Melatonin is a hormone produced by a gland in the brain called the pineal gland. The main function of melatonin is sleep regulation.Melatonin levels increase in response to darkness, telling the brain that night has arrived and it is time to sleep. When there is bright light, as in the morning, melatonin production shuts down and the brain knows that it is daytime.The day-night regulation properties of melatonin and light make them the two key factors in the establishment of the internal sleep-wake clock, or what is called the \"circadian cycle\".A circadian disorder occurs when there is a mismatch between the internal clock and the socially accepted time to go to sleep or to wake up, as is seen when someone travels across time zones and has jet lag. But jet lag sometimes can occur in the absence of travel. For example, when you remain in an environment of bright lights until late hours of the night, you fool your brain into thinking that it is still daytime.In this case, melatonin production does not occur and you don't feel sleepy until the late hours of the night, or sometimes early hours in the morning.I have seen many teenagers come to my clinic because they can't sleep until 2 am or 3 am, but they're up watching videos on their electronic devices until late at night.I usually recommend my patients turn the lights off at a reasonable time and expect sleepiness to start occurring within one hour. But it takes time for the natural clock to adjust to a new schedule, and often my patients prefer to use a melatonin supplement to quicken the circadian time adjustment.With the increase in use of electronic devices, sleep disorders have become quite common and melatonin use has increased. Because of its sleep-promoting properties, melatonin is also an incredibly attractive option for people who suffer from insomnia or sleep disruption.In some countries, such as the US, melatonin can be bought without a prescription. This situation concerns me because a lack of regulation can mean an increased risk of taking a different dose or ingredients than those reported.In fact, a study of melatonin supplements found that the content of the hormone ranged from -83 percent to +478 percent of the labelled content. The researchers also found other substances that were not reported to be in the preparation, including serotonin and valerian.In the EU, the UK, Canada and Australia, melatonin is obtained only by prescription for the short-term treatment of insomnia. This approach allows for better regulation, understanding and explanation of risks, benefits and alternatives to the use of melatonin.Even though melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone, it does not come without side-effects, the most common being headaches and dizziness. It can also interact with other medicines, such as anticoagulants (drugs that help prevent blood clots).The best evidence of safety for the use of melatonin is for short-term use only (one to three months) and in low doses (0.5-1mg). The long-term effects of melatonin remain unknown.Have I used melatonin or recommended it to my patients? Absolutely. But only when I know exactly what I am recommending it for. Insomnia can be a symptom of a sleep disorder like restless legs syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea, or it can be a symptom of another condition, such as depression, asthma or pain.When a sleep specialist identifies the correct diagnosis, then the treatment options can be explored. When I need to prescribe melatonin, I usually recommend starting with the lowest dose possible (0.5 mg) one to two hours before their current bedtime, and I recommend that the patient turns their lights off, or dims them, before taking melatonin. I also recommend avoiding other contributors to poor sleep, such as caffeinated products after 3 pm, heavy exercise in the evening, or the use of electronic devices before bedtime.  Lourdes M.
